The President issued E.O. 13994 on January 21, 2021, to ensure a\ndata-driven response to COVID-⁠19 and future high-consequence public health threats. The Cures\nAct and the information blocking provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability,\nInformation Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program (85 FR 25642) (ONC Cures\nAct Final Rule) took critical steps to making data available across the healthcare system.\n\nAdoption of USCDI v3 in this rule facilitates the gathering, sharing, and publication of public\nhealth and emergency response data (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) by capturing and promoting\nthe sharing of key data elements related to public health. The updates to API Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements, as discussed in section III.C.7, continue the\nimplementation of ONC’s statutory responsibilities and efforts to develop and standardize APIs\nand to help individuals and other authorized health care providers, including those engaged in\npublic health, securely access EHI through the broader adoption of standardized APIs.2, <sup>3</sup>\n\n\nFootnote 2:\nONC. (2022, October 18). API Resource Guide. ONC Health IT Certification Program API Resource Guide.\n\nRetrieved March 16, 2023, from https://onc-healthit.github.io/api-resource-guide/.\n\n\nFootnote 3:\nSection 4002 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) establishes a condition of certification that requires health\nIT developers to publish application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow “health information from such\ntechnology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor\ntechnology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.” The Cures Act's API Condition of Certification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this final rule adopts consensus-based, industry-developed health IT standards for\ncertified Health IT Modules to support electronic case reporting. As discussed in section III.C.4,\namong other benefits, electronic case reporting facilitates faster and more efficient disease\ntracking, prevention, and case management. It also provides more timely and complete data to\npublic health agencies than manual or non-standardized reporting.\n\nWe are also committed to advancing health equity, and this final rule is consistent with\nE.O. 13985 of January 20, 2021, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved\nCommunities Through the Federal Government,<sup>4</sup>\nand E.O. 14091 of February 16, 2023, Further\nAdvancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal\nGovernment.<sup>5</sup>\nSection 1 of E.O. 13985 states that “the Federal Government should pursue a\ncomprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who\nhave been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty\nand inequality.” Section 1 of E.O. 13985 also states that “because advancing equity requires a\nsystematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments\nand agencies must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that\nserve as barriers to equal opportunity.” As noted above, we have adopted USCDI v3 in this final\nrule to meet statutory responsibilities discussed in section II.A to improve the standardization of\nrequirement also states that a developer must, through an API, “provide access to all data elements of a patient's\nelectronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws.” The API Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements and certification criteria are identified in 45 CFR part 170.\n\n\nFootnote 4:\nUnited States, Executive Office of the President [Joseph Biden].

The USCDI\nv3 standard includes data elements on patient demographics (such as sexual orientation and\ngender identity) and social determinants of health (SDOH), as discussed in sections III.C.1 and\nIII.C.8 of this final rule. These updates help capture more accurate and complete patient\ncharacteristics that are reflective of patient diversity and inclusion, which could potentially help\ndata users address disparities in health outcomes for all patients, including those who may be\nmarginalized and underrepresented. The use of USCDI v3 also supports data users’ abilities to\nidentify, assess, and analyze gaps in care, which could in turn be used to inform and address the\nquality of healthcare through interventions and strategies. This could lead to better patient care,\nexperiences, and health outcomes.\n\nSection 1 of E.O. 14091 also requires the Federal Government to “promote equity in\nscience and root out bias in the design and use of new technologies, such as artificial\nintelligence.” Section 8 of E.O. 14091 requires agencies to “prevent and address discrimination\nand advance equity for all” and to “consider opportunities to prevent and remedy discrimination,\nincluding by protecting the public from algorithmic discrimination.” The E.O. states that the\nFederal Government shall continue to “advance equity in health, including mental and behavioral\nhealth and well-being.” We are committed to the concept of “health equity by design”<sup>6</sup>\n, in which\nhealth equity considerations are identified and incorporated from inception and throughout the\ntechnology design, build, and implementation process. We consider health equity by design to\nincorporate health equity strategies, tactics, and patterns as guiding principles for software and\nIT development, enforced by technical architecture, data, and information governance process,\n\n\nFootnote 6:\nHealthIT.gov: Embracing Health Equity by Design. https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-it/embracing-\nhealth-equity-by-design\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand built into the technology at every layer. In this final rule we apply the concept of health\nequity by design to bring transparency to the quality and performance of intelligence and\nmachine learning-based decision support tools in healthcare. As discussed in section III.C.5, the\n“decision support intervention,” (DSI) certification criterion is supportive of the goals of E.O.\n\n14091 and advances health equity by design by making it known to users of Health IT Modules\ncertified to the DSI criterion whether patient demographic, SDOH, or health assessment data are\nused in DSIs. Other finalized policies: (1) establish a definition for algorithm-based and model-\nbased “predictive” DSIs; (2) require Health IT Modules certified to the DSI criterion to enable\nusers to access information about the design, development, training, and evaluation of Predictive\nDSIs, including descriptions of training data and information on whether the Predictive DSI was\ntested and evaluated for fairness; (3) require developers of certified health IT to apply risk\nmanagement practices for all Predictive DSIs that are supplied by the developer of certified\nhealth IT as part of its Health IT Module; and (4) make summary information regarding these\npractices available publicly.\n\nAdditionally, the DSI certification criterion and surrounding transparency requirements\nare especially aligned with E.O. 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of\nArtificial Intelligence, issued October 30, 2023.<sup>7</sup>\nThe finalized DSI requirements will improve\ntransparency, promote trustworthiness, and incentivize the development and wider use of fair,\nappropriate, valid, effective, and safe Predictive DSIs to aid decision-making in healthcare. The\nresulting information transparency increases public trust and confidence in these technologies so\n\n\nFootnote 7:\nUnited States, Executive Office of the President [Joseph Biden].

This transparency also informs wider discussions, including those across industry,\nacademia, and government, regarding how to evaluate and communicate performance related to\nPredictive DSIs, consistent with Section 8 of the E.O., “Protecting Consumers, Patients,\nPassengers, and Students.”\n\nThe finalized DSI certification criterion also aligns with the public availability and\ntransparency policy goals of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum\n“Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research.”<sup>8</sup>\nThe\nmemorandum provides policy guidance to federal agencies and departments to promote\nimproved public access to and transparency of federally funded research. The finalized DSI\ncertification criterion aligns with the goals of the memorandum by establishing requirements to\nmake information available through § 170.315(b)(11)(iv), including information created through\nfederally funded research and evaluations, that will enable users to determine if a Predictive DSI\nsupplied by a health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module is acceptably fair, appropriate,\nvalid, effective, and safe.\n\nPresident Biden's E.O. 14036, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, issued\non July 9, 2021, established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the\nAmerican economy and reaffirmed the policy stated in E.O. 13725 of April 15, 2016 (Steps to\nIncrease Competition and Better Inform Consumers and Workers to Support Continued Growth\n\n\nFootnote 8:\nEnsuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research. Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy (OSTP) (2022). https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-\nMemo.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the American Economy).<sup>9</sup>\nThis final rule fosters competition by advancing foundational\nstandards for certified API technology, which enable—through applications (apps) and without\nspecial effort—improved legally permissible sharing of EHI among clinicians, patients,\nresearchers, and others. As described in section III.C.7, competition is advanced through these\nimproved API standards that can help individuals connect to their information and can help\nauthorized health care providers, involved in the patient’s care, securely access information. For\nexample, these standards are designed to foster an ecosystem of new applications that can\nconnect through the API technology to provide patients with improved electronic access to EHI.\n\nFurther, as described in section IV, this final rule provides enhancements to support\ninformation sharing under the information blocking regulations and promote innovation and\ncompetition, as well as address market consolidation. As we have noted, addressing information\nblocking is critical for promoting innovation and competition in health IT and for the delivery of\nhealthcare services to individuals. In both the ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule (84 FR 7508) and\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25790 through 25791), we discussed how the information blocking provisions\nprovide a comprehensive response to the issues identified by empirical and economic research.\n\nThis research suggested that information blocking may weaken competition, encourage\nconsolidation, and create barriers to entry for developers of new and innovative applications and\ntechnologies that enable more effective uses of EHI to improve population health and the patient\nexperience.<sup>10</sup>\nWe explained that the information blocking provisions of the Public Health Service\n\n\nFootnote 9:\nUnited States, Executive Office of the President [Joseph Biden].

Actors subject to the information blocking provisions may,<sup>11</sup>\namong other practices, attempt to exploit their control over interoperability elements to create\nbarriers to entry for competing technologies and services that offer greater value for health IT\ncustomers and users, provide new or improved capabilities, and enable more robust access,\nexchange, and use of EHI (85 FR 25820).<sup>12</sup>\nInformation blocking may not only harm competition\nin health IT markets, but also in markets for healthcare services (85 FR 25820). In the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule, we described practices that dominant market health care providers may\nleverage and use to control access and use of their technology, resulting in technical dependence\nand possibly leading to barriers to entry by would-be competitors, as well as making some\nmarket health care providers vulnerable to acquisition or inducement into arrangements that\nenhance the market power of incumbent health care providers to the detriment of consumers and\npurchasers of healthcare services (85 FR 25820).

The rule also defines what is not considered information blocking, to ease the sharing of data. It aligns with Executive Orders to improve public health data sharing, promote health equity, and advance technology standards. The rule adopts the USCDI v3 standard for better data sharing in emergencies and updates API conditions for secure EHI access. It emphasizes health equity by requiring data on demographics and social determinants of health. Transparency for decision support tools is mandated, with disclosures on their use and design. The rule introduces the 'Insights Condition' for certification, providing insights on health IT use. Additionally, the ONC is coordinating with CMS to align health IT certification timelines with CMS program schedules, adjusting compliance dates to the calendar year for clarity.",

The DSI\ncriterion is a revised certification criterion, serving both an iterative update and replacement\ncriterion for the “clinical decision support (CDS)” certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) (88\nFR 23751). The DSI criterion, as finalized, ensures that Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) reflect an array of contemporary functionalities, support data elements important\nto health equity, and enable the transparent use of predictive models and algorithms to aid\ndecision-making in healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have adopted a new definition for Predictive Decision Support Intervention, (also\nreferred to hereafter as Predictive DSI) in § 170.102, and we have finalized that Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must enable a limited set of identified users to select (i.e.,\nactivate) evidence-based and Predictive DSIs, as described in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii). Additionally,\nwe have finalized that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must support “source\nattributes”—categories of technical performance and quality information—for both evidence-\nbased and Predictive DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv).\n\nWe have not finalized proposed requirements that Health IT Modules clearly indicate\nwhen source attributes from other parties are unavailable. Rather, we have finalized that Health\nIT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must enable a limited set of identified users to access\ncomplete and up-to-date descriptions of all source attributes related to evidence-based DSIs and\nPredictive DSIs that are supplied by the developer of certified health IT as part of their Health IT\nModule, as described in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A). Moreover, we have finalized in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v)(B) requirements that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must\nenable a limited set of identified users to record and change source attributes listed in paragraphs\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B).\n\nWe have also finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) that intervention risk management (IRM)\npractices must be applied for each Predictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as part of\nits Health IT Module, including requirements to subject Predictive DSIs to risk analysis and risk\nmitigation related to validity, reliability, robustness, fairness, intelligibility, safety, security, and\nprivacy. We note that for governance practices, we have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C)\nrequirements for Health IT Modules to be subject to policies and implemented controls for\ngovernance, including how data are acquired, managed, and used. Consistent with the other IRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\npractices, these policies and implemented controls must be applied for all Predictive DSIs\nsupplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module.\n\nAdditionally, in consideration of comments received and the scope reductions we have\nmade to this final certification criterion, we determined that a supportive Maintenance of\nCertification requirement as part of the Assurances Condition of Certification is necessary to\nimplement our policy objectives and proposals fully. Specifically, we have included in this final\nrule a Maintenance of Certification requirement at 45 CFR 170.402(b)(4) that reinforces a health\nIT developer’s ongoing responsibility to review and update, as necessary, source attribute\ninformation in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) and (B), risk management practices described in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi), and summary information provided through § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi). We have\nfinalized in § 170.402(b)(4) that developers with products certified to § 170.315(b)(11) will need\nto comply with this Maintenance of Certification requirement starting January 1, 2025.\n\nFinally, we have finalized our proposals to facilitate this transition from one version of\nthe criterion to the other by updating the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition in § 170.102,<sup>14</sup>\nwhich is being replaced with a definition of Base EHR, to include an option for a Health IT\nModule to meet the definition by either being certified to the existing CDS version of the\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(a)(9), or being certified to the revised DSI criterion in §\n170.315(b)(11), for the period up to, and including, December 31, 2024. On and after January 1,\n2025, only the DSI criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) will be included in the Base EHR definition and\nthe adoption of the criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) will expire on January 1, 2025. We discuss in\n\n\nFootnote 14:\nIn section III.C.5.a.i., we discuss finalizing our proposal to adopt a definition of “Base EHR” and remove the prior\ndefinition of “2015 Edition Base EHR.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsection III.C.5.b of this preamble policies that would constitute changes to the CDS criterion, as\nthe new DSI criterion.\n\n\n",

We intend to explore the other Cures Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncategories (security, usability and user-centered design, conformance to certification testing, and\nother categories to measure the performance of EHR technology) in future years.\n\nWe have also finalized, as discussed in section III.F, the implementation of the Insights\nCondition requirements in § 170.407 in three phases over three years, where health IT developers\nto which the requirements apply, will be required to report on some of the measures earlier than\nothers. For each final measure, we have included information on the rationale for adopting the\nmeasure, the final metrics, and other key topics. The Insights Condition will provide transparent\nreporting, address information gaps in the health IT marketplace, and provide insights on the use\nof health IT.\n\n\n",

              "text": "As discussed in section IV.B.1 of this preamble, we have finalized a definition of “offer\nhealth information technology” or “offer health IT” for purposes of the information blocking\nregulations in 45 CFR part 171. This definition of “offer health IT,” as finalized in § 171.102,\nnarrows the applicability of the “health IT developer of certified health IT” definition in 45 CFR\n171.102. The definition of “offer health IT,” finalized in 45 CFR 171.102, will generally\ncontinue to include holding out for sale, selling, or otherwise supplying certified health IT to\nothers on commercial or other terms. However, our finalized definition of “offer health IT”\nexplicitly excludes certain activities and arrangements. First, the “offer health IT” definition\nexcludes making available funding to obtain or maintain certified health IT, provided the funding\nis made available without condition(s) limiting the interoperability, or use of the technology to\naccess, exchange or use electronic health information for any lawful purpose (see paragraph (1)\nof the offer health IT definition). Second, the finalized “offer health IT” definition also explicitly\ncodifies that health care providers or other health IT users do not “offer health IT” when they\n\n\n\n\n\n\nengage in certain health IT implementation and use activities, regardless of whether they obtain\nthat health IT from a commercial developer or a reseller or develop it themselves (see paragraph\n(2) of the offer health IT definition).\n\nWe have also finalized (in paragraph (3) of the “offer health IT” definition) an exclusion\nfrom the “offer health IT” definition that applies to certain consulting and legal services. This\nconsulting and legal services exclusion (see subparagraph (3)(iii)) encompasses supplying health\nIT in complement to the other items, supplies, facilities, and services that a consultant handles\nfor a clinician practice or other health care provider in a comprehensive (“turn key”) package of\nservices for administrative or operational management (see section IV.B.1.c.iii of this preamble).\n\nThe consulting and legal services exclusion from the “offer health IT” definition also\nencompasses assistance by health IT consultants with the selection, implementation, and use of\nhealth IT as specified in subparagraph (3)(ii) and legal services furnished by outside counsel as\nspecified in subparagraph (3)(i).\n\nAs discussed in section IV.B.2, we have modified the “health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT” definition so that it is clear that health care providers who self-develop certified health\nIT will continue to be excluded from this definition if they do not engage in activities falling\nwithin the “offer health IT” definition. The updated § 171.102 health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT definition we have finalized represents a change from prior policy to the extent that a\nhealth care provider that is a self-developer would not meet the definition of “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” if they supply certified health IT to one or more other health\ncare provider(s) under a comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT administrative or\noperations management services arrangement consistent with subparagraph (3)(iii) (under the\nconsulting and legal services exclusion from the 45 CFR 171.102 “offer health IT” definition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, health care providers who self-developed certified health IT were excluded from the\n45 CFR 171.102 “health IT developer of certified health IT” definition if they self-developed the\nHealth IT Module(s) for their “own use” (85 FR 25799 and 25956).\n\nWe have finalized revisions to the text of § 171.103, which defines “information\nblocking” for purposes of 45 CFR part 171, to remove paragraph (b) that established a period of\ntime during which electronic health information (EHI) for purposes of the information blocking\nprovision (§ 171.103) was limited to a subset of EHI that was identified by the data elements\nrepresented in the USCDI standard adopted in § 170.213. As established in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25793, 85 FR 25876, and 85 FR 25956), that period of time ended on May 2,\n2022. The end date of that period of time was extended to October 5, 2022, in the subsequent\ninterim final rule with comment titled “Information Blocking and the ONC Health IT\nCertification Program: Extension of the Compliance Dates and Timeframes in Response to the\nCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency” (85 FR 70064). On and after October 6, 2022, the scope\nof EHI for purposes of the “information blocking” definition (§ 171.103) is EHI as defined in\n§ 171.102 (88 FR 23754, see also 85 FR 25793, 25876, 70069, and 70085). October 5, 2022,\nhas passed. Therefore, the paragraph (which had been designated paragraph (b), as codified)\nlimiting the “information blocking” definition to the subset of EHI for the specified time period\nis no longer needed. We have re-designated remaining paragraphs of § 171.103 as discussed in\nsection IV.B.3 and as shown in updated text we have finalized in § 171.103 (see Regulation\nText, see also discussion in section IV.B.3).\n\nWe note that in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule we did not propose to change the scope of EHI\nfor purposes of the information blocking definition (88 FR 23754). We simply proposed to\nupdate the CFR text to remove paragraph (b) from § 171.103 that had temporarily—until\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 5, 2022—limited the scope of the information blocking definition to the subset of EHI\nrepresented by USCDI v1 (88 FR 23864 and 23916). Similarly, because we included the same\ntime period in reference to the scope of EHI in two paragraphs of the Content and Manner\nException (§ 171.301(a)(1) and (2)), we proposed to revise § 171.301 to remove from the\nregulatory text the existing § 171.301(a)(1) and (2) as no longer necessary (88 FR 23754). We\nhave finalized the revisions to § 171.301 to remove the regulatory text in subparagraphs (a)(1)\nand (2) as no longer necessary and rename § 171.301 the Manner Exception. We have finalized\nthe redesignation of the paragraphs now codified within § 171.301, so that different paragraphs\nare now designated (a)(1) and (2) rather than the paragraphs we have removed as no longer\nnecessary (see discussion in sections IV.B.3 and IV.C.2, see also Regulation Text for revised and\nredesignated paragraphs of § 171.301).\n\nAs explained in section IV.C.1, we have finalized revisions to the Infeasibility Exception\ncodified in 45 CFR 171.204 both by adding two new conditions and by revising one existing\ncondition for improved clarity. First, we have finalized revisions to the uncontrollable events\ncondition in § 171.204(a)(1) to further clarify when an actor’s practice meets the uncontrollable\nevents condition. Our finalized revision to § 171.204(a), the uncontrollable events condition of\nthe Infeasibility Exception, is discussed in Section IV.C.1.a. Second, we have added two new\nconditions to be codified as subparagraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) and have, therefore, redesignated the\ninfeasible under the circumstances condition as subparagraph (a)(5). The infeasible under the\ncircumstances condition was previously designated as subparagraph (a)(3) of § 171.204.\n\nThe first new infeasibility condition in § 171.204(a)(3) (discussed in Section IV.C.1.b)\nwill apply to an actor’s practice of denying a third party’s request to enable use of EHI in order\nto modify EHI, including, but not limited to, creation and deletion functionality, provided the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest is not from a health care provider requesting such use from an actor that is their business\nassociate.<sup>19</sup>\nIn support of this new condition, we have finalized as proposed a definition of\n“business associate” in § 171.102. That definition is, by cross-reference to 45 CFR 160.103, the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule’s definition of “business associate.”\n\nThe second new infeasibility condition in § 171.204(a)(4), discussed in Section IV.C.1.c,\nwill apply where an actor has exhausted the Manner Exception in § 171.301, including offering\nat least two alternative manners in accordance with § 171.301(b), including one manner that uses\neither technology certified to standard(s) adopted in 45 CFR part 170 that is specified by the\nrequestor (§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)) or published content and transport standards consistent with\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(ii). The actor cannot meet this new condition if the actor currently provides a\nsubstantial number of individuals or entities similarly situated to the requestor with the same\nrequested access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI.\n\nAs discussed in section IV.C.3, we have finalized a new subpart D under part 171 for\ninformation blocking exceptions that involve practices related to actors’ participation in the\nTrusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCASM\n). In this new subpart D, we\nhave established a standalone TEFCA Manner Exception, in § 171.403, that is based on a\nproposed TEFCA manner condition of the Manner Exception that was included in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule. The new exception provides that an actor's practice of not fulfilling a request to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI in any alternative manner besides via TEFCA will not be\nconsidered information blocking when the practice follows certain conditions, which are\ndiscussed in more detail in section IV.C.3. Both the actor and requestor must be part of TEFCA,\n\n\nFootnote 19:\nSee definition of “business associate” at 45 CFR 160.103. Business associates include a subcontractor that creates,\nreceives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of the business associate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the requestor must be able to access, exchange, or use the requested EHI via TEFCA. In\nconsideration of comments and our stated policy goals, any fees or license agreements must\nsatisfy the Fees (§ 171.302) and Licensing (§ 171.303) exceptions, which is counter to our initial\nproposed position. Further, in consideration of our stated policy goals and comments we\nreceived, the exception is not available when the requestor has requested access, exchange, or\nuse via FHIR-based APIs.\n\nIn section IV.D, we discuss information blocking requests for information that we\nincluded in section IV.C of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23873).\n\n\n",

L. 111-5), was enacted on February 17, 2009. The HITECH Act\namended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and created “Title XXX—Health Information\nTechnology and Quality” (Title XXX) to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency\nthrough the promotion of health IT and electronic health information (EHI) exchange.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255 (Cures Act), was enacted on December 13,\n2016, to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurposes. The Cures Act, through Title IV – Delivery, amended the HITECH Act by modifying\nor adding certain provisions to the PHSA relating to health IT.\n\nSection 119 of Title I, Division CC of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub.\n\nL. 116-260 (CAA), enacted on December 27, 2020, requires prescription drug plan (PDP)\nsponsors to implement one or more real-time benefit tools (RTBTs) that meet the requirements\ndescribed in the statute, after the Secretary has adopted a standard for RTBTs and at a time\ndetermined appropriate by the Secretary. For purposes of the requirement to implement a real-\ntime benefit tool in section 1860D-4(o)(1) of the Social Security Act, described above, the CAA\nprovides that one of the requirements for an RTBT is that it can integrate with electronic\nprescribing and EHR systems of prescribing healthcare professionals for the transmission of\nformulary and benefit information in real time to such professionals. The statute requires\nincorporation of RTBTs within both the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and the\nProgram. Specifically, the law amends the definition of a “qualified electronic health record”\n\n(qualified EHR) in section 3000(13) of the PHSA to require that a qualified EHR must include\n(or be capable of including) an RTBT.\n\n\n",

Section 3002(a) of the PHSA, as added by the Cures Act, establishes that the HITAC\nrecommends to the National Coordinator policies and standards, implementation specifications,\nand certification criteria, relating to the implementation of a health information technology\ninfrastructure, nationally and locally, that advances the electronic access, exchange, and use of\nhealth information. Further described in section 3002(b)(1) of the PHSA, this includes\nrecommending to the National Coordinator a policy framework to advance interoperable health\ninformation technology infrastructure, updating recommendations to the policy framework, and\nmaking new recommendations, as appropriate. Section 3002(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA specifies that\nin general, the HITAC shall recommend to the National Coordinator for purposes of adoption\nunder section 3004, standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and an\norder of priority for the development, harmonization, and recognition of such standards,\nspecifications, and certification criteria. Like the process previously required of the former\nHITPC and HITSC, section 3002(b)(5) of the PHSA requires the HITAC to develop a schedule,\nupdated annually, for the assessment of policy recommendations, which the Secretary publishes\nin the Federal Register.\n\nSection 3004 of the PHSA establishes a process for the adoption of health IT standards,\nimplementation specifications, and certification criteria and authorizes the Secretary to adopt\nsuch standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. As specified in section\n3004(a)(1), the Secretary is required, in consultation with representatives of other relevant\nfederal agencies, to jointly review standards, implementation specifications, and certification\ncriteria endorsed by the National Coordinator under section 3001(c) and subsequently determine\nwhether to propose the adoption of such standards, implementation specifications, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertification criteria. Section 3004(a)(3) requires the Secretary to publish all such determinations\nin the Federal Register.\n\nSection 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA, titled Subsequent Standards Activity, provides that the\nSecretary shall adopt additional standards, implementation specifications, and certification\ncriteria as necessary and consistent with the schedule published by the HITAC. We consider this\nprovision in the broader context of the HITECH Act and Cures Act to grant the Secretary the\nauthority and discretion to adopt standards, implementation specifications, and certification\ncriteria that have been recommended by the HITAC and endorsed by the National Coordinator,\nas well as other appropriate and necessary health IT standards, implementation specifications,\nand certification criteria.\n\n\n",

On\nMarch 10, 2010, the Secretary issued a proposed rule, “Proposed Establishment of Certification\nPrograms for Health Information Technology” (75 FR 11328), that proposed both temporary and\npermanent certification programs for the purposes of testing and certifying health IT. A final rule\nestablishing the temporary certification program was published on June 24, 2010, “Establishment\nof the Temporary Certification Program for Health Information Technology” (75 FR 36158), and\na final rule establishing the permanent certification program was published on January 7, 2011,\n“Establishment of the Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology” (76\nFR 1262).\n\nWe have engaged in multiple rulemakings to update standards, implementation\nspecifications, certification criteria, and the certification program, a history of which can be\nfound in the October 16, 2015 final rule “2015 Edition Health Information Technology (Health\nIT) Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and\nONC Health IT Certification Program Modifications” (80 FR 62602) (2015 Edition Final Rule).\n\nThe history can be found at 80 FR 62606. A correction notice was published for the 2015 Edition\nFinal Rule on December 11, 2015 (80 FR 76868), to correct preamble and regulatory text errors\nand clarify requirements of the Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), the 2015 Edition privacy\nand security certification framework, and the mandatory disclosures for health IT developers.\n\nThe 2015 Edition Final Rule established a new edition of certification criteria (“2015\nEdition health IT certification criteria” or “2015 Edition”) and a new 2015 Edition Base EHR\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefinition. The 2015 Edition established the minimum capabilities and specified the related\nminimum standards and implementation specifications that certified electronic health record\ntechnology (CEHRT) would need to include to support the achievement of “meaningful use” by\neligible clinicians, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals under the Medicare and\nMedicaid EHR Incentive Programs (EHR Incentive Programs) (now the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program and the Promoting Interoperability performance category of MIPS)\nwhen the 2015 Edition is required for use under these and other programs referencing the\nCEHRT definition. The 2015 Edition Final Rule also adopted a proposal to change the\nProgram’s name to the “ONC Health IT Certification Program” from the ONC HIT Certification\nProgram, modified the Program to make it more accessible to other types of health IT beyond\nEHR technology and for health IT that supports care and practice settings beyond the ambulatory\nand inpatient settings, and adopted new and revised Principles of Proper Conduct (PoPC) for\nONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs).\n\nAfter issuing a proposed rule on March 2, 2016, “ONC Health IT Certification Program:\nEnhanced Oversight and Accountability” (81 FR 11056), we published a final rule by the same\ntitle (81 FR 72404) (EOA Final Rule) on October 19, 2016. The EOA Final Rule finalized\nmodifications and new requirements under the Program, including provisions related to our role\nin the Program. The EOA Final Rule created a regulatory framework for our direct review of\nhealth IT certified under the Program, including, when necessary, requiring the correction of\nnon-conformities found in health IT certified under the Program and suspending and terminating\ncertifications issued to Complete EHRs and Health IT Modules. The EOA Final Rule also set\nforth processes for us to authorize and oversee accredited testing laboratories under the Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, it included provisions for expanded public availability of certified health IT\nsurveillance results.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, the Secretary published a proposed rule titled, “21st Century Cures\nAct: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program” (84\nFR 7424) (ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule). The ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule proposed to\nimplement certain provisions of the Cures Act that would advance interoperability and support\nthe access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. We also requested comment in\nthe ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule (84 FR 7467) as to whether certain health IT developers\nshould be required to participate in TEFCA as a means of providing assurances to their\ncustomers and ONC that they are not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any\nother action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI, with the goal of\ndeveloping or supporting TEFCA for the purpose of ensuring full network-to-network exchange\nof health information.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, a final rule was published titled, “21st Century Cures Act:\nInteroperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program” (85 FR\n25642) (ONC Cures Act Final Rule). The ONC Cures Act Final Rule implemented certain\nprovisions of the Cures Act, including Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements\nfor health information technology (health IT) developers, the voluntary certification of health IT\nfor use by pediatric health providers, and reasonable and necessary activities that do not\nconstitute information blocking. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule also implemented certain parts\nof the Cures Act to support patients’ access to their EHI, and the implementation of information\nblocking policies that support patient electronic access. Additionally, the ONC Cures Act Final\nRule modified the 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria and Program in other ways to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadvance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs, as well as\nimproving patient and health care provider access to EHI and promoting competition. On\nNovember 4, 2020, the Secretary published an interim final rule with comment period titled,\n“Information Blocking and the ONC Health IT Certification Program: Extension of Compliance\nDates and Timeframes in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency” (85 FR 70064)\n(Cures Act Interim Final Rule). The Cures Act Interim Final Rule extended certain compliance\ndates and timeframes adopted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule to offer the healthcare system\nadditional flexibilities in furnishing services to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nextending the applicability date for information blocking provisions to April 5, 2021.\n\nOn January 19, 2022, we published a notice titled, “Notice of Publication of the Trusted\nExchange Framework and Common Agreement” (87 FR 2800) (“TEFCA”). The notice fulfilled\nan obligation under section 3001(c)(9)(C) of the PHSA, which requires the National Coordinator\nfor Health Information Technology to publish on the Office of the National Coordinator for\nHealth Information Technology’s public internet website, and in the Federal Register, the\ntrusted exchange framework and common agreement developed under the PHSA.\n\nOn April 18, 2023, the Secretary published a proposed rule titled, “Health Data,\nTechnology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and\nInformation Sharing” (HTI-1) (88 FR 23746) (HTI-1 Proposed Rule). The HTI-1 Proposed Rule\nproposed to implement the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Reporting Program provision of the\n21st Century Cures Act by establishing new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements for health IT developers under the Program. The HTI-1 Proposed Rule also\nproposed several updates to certification criteria and implementation specifications recognized\nby the Program, including a revised certification criterion for decision support and revised\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertification criteria for “patient demographics and observations” and “electronic case reporting.”\n\nAdditionally, the HTI-1 Proposed Rule proposed to establish a new baseline version of the\nUnited States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). The HTI-1 Proposed Rule also proposed\nenhancements to support information sharing under the information blocking regulations. The\nimplementation of these provisions would advance interoperability, improve transparency, and\nsupport the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. The HTI-1 Proposed Rule\nalso proposed to update the Program in additional ways to advance interoperability, enhance\nhealth IT certification, and reduce burden and costs and is subject of this final rule.\n\n\n",

One commenter\nsuggested that the timeline for adoption might be too aggressive and lead to health IT developers\nproducing Health IT Modules that meet certification standards without providing the intended\nsubstantive benefits for patients and providers. A few commenters suggested that ONC create a\nstandardized framework and cycle for adopting and requiring new and revised standards for\ncertification criteria. Commenters suggested that ONC give more consideration to the burden\nplaced on the health IT community by the requirements of both ONC and CMS standards, and\nwork with CMS and other HHS agencies to more closely align standards and compliance dates.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ concerns about the timelines for conformance to\nnew standards and certification criteria for the Program. After consideration of comments, we\nhave finalized the adoption of certain certification criteria and standards with a compliance date\nof January 1, 2026, instead of the proposed compliance date of January 1, 2025, and noted in the\nspecific certification criteria or standards each specific adopted conformance date. We have\nfinalized the adoption of § 170.315(a)(5); (b)(1), (2), and (9); (e)(1); (f)(5); and (g)(6), (9), and\n(10) with a compliance date of January 1, 2026. We believe that these updated compliance dates,\nwhich are approximately two years from when this final rule published in the Federal Register,\nfor certain criteria will allow developers increased flexibility and alleviate burden by allowing\nadditional time for developers to prioritize updates, while also ensuring timely implementation of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe requirements for health care providers and patients. We note that the compliance date defines\nthe date by which a health IT developer with a Health IT Module certified to any revised\ncertification criterion, as defined in § 170.102, must update the Health IT Module and provide\nsuch update to their customers in order for the Health IT Module to maintain certification.\n\nIn response to commenters’ recommendations for a standardized framework and cycle for\nupdates to certification criteria, we appreciate commenters’ concerns about the long-term\ntimeline for updates to ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT. We have finalized our proposed\napproach to discontinue the use of year themed editions for ONC Certification Criteria for Health\nIT and adopt an incremental approach to updates to ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT. We\nbelieve that an incremental approach to updates will allow for a more consistent and transparent\nupdate cycle. We plan to issue clear guidance and timelines for when updates would be required.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters stated that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and ONC’s\nrulemaking schedule is overly complex, including a broad range of proposed changes to\nregulations. Some commenters recommended simplifying the proposals in this rule or creating a\nprocess to introduce more simplified regulatory updates in the future.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed about the complexity and broad scope\nof the changes to standards and the Program in this rule. Upon consideration of all the comments\nwe have received, we have made adjustments, such as an extended implementation timeline for\nmost standards and certification criteria and modified requirements for Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11), in this final rule to alleviate the potential burden on developers of\ncertified health IT and health care providers.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that the adoption of a singular set of standards for\nEHI could have harmful effects for Health IT Modules. A few commenters were concerned that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe standards in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule would not allow for specific standards for specialized\nor small health care providers. A few commenters were concerned that the requirements in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule could make health care providers dependent on collaboration with health\nIT developers to meet their obligations and could increase EHR fees for physicians or create\nbottlenecks that prevent physicians from adopting new EHR technology. Some commenters\nrecommended that ONC provide assistance and guidance for providers to understand new\nrequirements, and consider patient accessibility, particularly the limitations of patient literacy\nregarding healthcare and health IT, for requirements for patients’ records. A number of\ncommenters were concerned that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule’s requirements for interoperability\nand patient access would not adequately protect patients’ private information. Several\ncommenters also recommended that ONC require greater transparency from health IT developers\nto foster an accessible health IT marketplace for consumers.\n\n*Response.* We believe the updated standards and certification criteria will improve health\nIT interoperability and functionality for providers and patients. We thank commenters for their\ncomments regarding privacy concerns and recognize the importance of addressing the privacy\nand confidentiality of sensitive information. Recognizing this, the Program establishes the\nstandards, implementation specifications, and functional requirements for certified health IT to\nmanage and exchange data but does not control the collection or use of data. For more on patient\nrequested restrictions on sharing of their health information, we refer readers to section III.C.10\non modifications to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in §\n170.315(e)(1), which addresses patients’ (and their authorized representatives’) ability to use an\ninternet-based method to request a restriction to be applied for any data expressed in the\nstandards in § 170.213. We also appreciate commenters recommending that we require greater\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntransparency from health IT developers to foster an accessible health IT marketplace for\nconsumers. As stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23831) and this final rule, data\ncollected and reported under the Insights Condition will address information gaps in the health\nIT marketplace and provide insights on the use of certified health IT. We believe that consumers\nwill benefit from the increased transparency that the reporting requirements of Insights Condition\nwill provide.\n\nWhile we believe that the language that we use in this rule provides clarity on the effects\nof this rule, as we did with the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we will develop, as appropriate, resources\nsuch as infographics, FAQs, and fact sheets and provide webinars among other forms of\neducational materials and outreach to explain the effects of this rule for developers, providers,\nand patients.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested that ONC adopt a definition of “health IT\ndeveloper” to provide more clarity regarding what entities may be considered developers for\ncertification criteria.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We decline to adopt a new definition\nfor “health IT developer” in this rule. Adopting a new definition for “health IT developer” would\nbe out of scope for this rule because we did not propose a definition of “health IT developer” in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended ONC include non-patient facing facilities\n(e.g., radiology) in the certified health IT requirements. This commenter stated that by\nestablishing specialty-specific or size-specific health IT requirements, the goal of promoting\ninteroperability across the healthcare landscape may be better achieved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their feedback. Including non-patient facing\nfacilities in the certified health IT requirements was out of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule’s scope. As\nwe did not propose such changes to health IT requirements in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, these\nchanges would also be out of scope for this rule.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters raised issues that are out of scope for this rule, including\nconcerns specifically about CMS policies and requirements.\n\n*Response.* We reiterate that comments regarding CMS program requirements are out of\nscope as we cannot change CMS policy. We refer to readers to CMS programs for further\ninformation.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters requested that ONC provide technical assistance for the\nimplementation of the requirements of this rule.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. As we did with the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule, we will develop, as appropriate, resources such as infographics, FAQs, and fact sheets and\nprovide webinars among other forms of educational materials and outreach to explain the effects\nof this rule for interest parties.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters identified issues that were out of scope for our proposal,\nsuch as requesting potential changes to the Cures Act and other federal legislation, and\ndeveloping state local public health infrastructure and regulations with state and local health\nagencies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ interest in federal legislation, and state and local\npublic health infrastructure and regulations. Because we did not propose changes related to these\nareas in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, these comments are out of scope, and we decline to finalize\nthe recommended changes in this rule. ONC does not have the authority to change federal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegislation through rulemaking. ONC looks forward to communicating with state and local\npublic health agencies for the implementation of this rule and the development of future\nrulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* We also received numerous comments that were out of scope or that\nrecommended that ONC adopt new requirements that we did not propose and are not addressed\nin this rulemaking.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. These comments are out of scope for the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule in that we did not propose changes to the requirements the comments\naddressed, and we decline to finalize such changes.\n\n\n",

Instead, we proposed that\nthere should be a single set of certification criteria, which would be updated in an incremental\nfashion in closer alignment to standards development cycles and regular health IT development\ntimelines. We proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to rename all certification criteria within the\nProgram simply as “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT” (88 FR 23759). We explained that\nmaintaining a single set of “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT” would create more\nstability for users of health IT and Program partners, such as CMS, as well as make it easier for\ndevelopers of certified health IT to maintain their product certificates over time. Unchanged\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertification criteria would no longer be duplicated as separate criteria under multiple editions.\n\nAccordingly, we proposed to rename § 170.315 as the “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT”\nand replace all references throughout 45 CFR part 170 to the “2015 Edition” with this new\ndescription (this would impact the wording, though not the substance or effect, of §§ 170.102,\n170.405, 170.406, 170.523, 170.524, and 170.550, as shown in the revised regulation text).\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters were supportive of ONC’s proposed approach to\ndiscontinue the use of year-themed editions for ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT, stating\nthat it would reduce confusion. Commenters generally indicated that the change from year\nthemed editions to adopting the name “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT” would be\nunderstood by health IT developers, patients, and health care providers. Commenters stated and\nagreed that the previous naming convention inaccurately implied the age and outdatedness of the\ncertification criteria and contributed to confusion about which edition was required for Program\nadherence. A number of commenters agreed that the change to incremental updates of\ncertification criteria would be more efficient and allow for more flexibility than the edition-based\nupdates to certification criteria that ONC has previously adopted. One commenter stated that\nsuch an approach would be more appropriate given the rapid pace at which health IT evolves.\n\nAnother commenter favored the use of clear, regular, step-by-step updates in small portions,\nrather than complete overhauls of certification criteria. The commenter also favored a predictable\ntimeline for updates based on standards development cycles with reasonable development\ntimelines.\n\nAlternatively, some commenters expressed concern that discontinuing year-themed\neditions and adopting incremental advancement for certification criteria would create too much\nburden for developers of certified health IT and health care providers around updating Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModules. Commenters stated that adopting incremental updates to many criteria instead of\nedition-based updates to criteria could lead to too many and too frequent deadlines for\ndevelopers and providers to comply with and a significant added burden in cost and time.\n\nCommenters raised concerns that incremental standards updates may divert developer resources\naway from implementing provider requests. A few developers recommended that ONC adopt a\nregular cycle for updates and compliance to certification criteria and provide adequate time\nbetween revisions to criteria that accommodate typical development timelines for Health IT\nModules. Numerous commenters contended that the proposed approach to discontinue the use of\nyear-themed editions for ONC health IT certification criteria in favor of using the title “ONC\nCertification Criteria for Health IT” would not add sufficient clarity to the Program or would\nactually make the Program more difficult to understand. Commenters stated that the incremental\nupdates for certification criteria could make it difficult for developers and consumers to\nunderstand which iterations of revised and updated standards are the most recently adopted\ncriteria that Health IT Modules need to be certified to. A few commenters stressed that ONC\nshould provide specificity and education regarding the standards that are necessary to participate\nin federal interoperability programs. Some commenters recommended that ONC create a listing\nof information on certification criteria that health IT developers and consumers could reference\nto determine the most up-to-date standards for a certification criterion and Health IT Module\ncertified to such criterion. A few commenters requested greater clarity on how much\nresponsibility consumers as opposed to developers would bear for maintaining the certification\nfor Health IT Modules with the adoption of incremental advancements. One commenter was\nconcerned that developers might charge providers the costs for updates and recommended that\nONC add a requirement for developers to inform health care providers of the meaning of a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“provider product” and the consequences of declining updates to health IT for participation in\nother federal programs.\n\n*Response.* We thank all commenters for their thoughtful feedback. Upon consideration of\nall comments received on this proposal, we have finalized our approach as proposed. As noted in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule (FR 23759), we believe that there should be a single set of certification\ncriteria, which would be updated in an incremental fashion in closer alignment to standards\ndevelopment cycles and regular health IT development timelines. To finalize this proposal, we\nrenamed all certification criteria within the Program simply as “ONC Certification Criteria for\nHealth IT.” We believe maintaining a single set of “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT”\nwill create more stability for users of health IT and Program partners, such as CMS, as well as\nmake it easier for developers of certified health IT to maintain their product certificates over\ntime. In addition, we believe that this approach will have the benefit of reducing administrative\nburden for health IT developers participating in the Program. Previously, duplicative references\nto separate certification criteria under multiple, year-themed editions created administrative\nburden for health IT developers by requiring developers to seek an updated certificate attributed\nto the “new” duplicated certification criterion even in circumstances when the certification\ncriterion remained substantively unchanged. Under this approach, unchanged certification\ncriteria would no longer be duplicated as separate criteria under multiple editions. Accordingly,\nwe renamed § 170.315 as the “ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT” and replaced all\nreferences throughout 45 CFR part 170 to the “2015 Edition” with this new description (this\nimpacted the wording, though not the substance or effect, of §§ 170.102, 170.405, 170.406,\n170.523, 170.524, and 170.550, as shown in the revised regulation text).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to those commenters that expressed reservations, discontinuing the use of\nyear-themed editions for ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT will not impose a significant\nburden on implementers. Our intent with this approach is to maintain a single set of certification\ncriteria that have been updated to include the most recent versions of adopted standards, and to\nestablish an incremental approach to health IT updates over time. In fact, this has been embedded\nwithin the Program’s approach all along because of the way we revised only certain certification\ncriteria within an edition change. Moreover, in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we stated our\nbelief that this kind of approach should also include development timelines based on the updates\nrequired for each criterion and a transition period allowing for either the prior adopted standard\nor the new standard to be used for a reasonable period of time (before shifting to exclusive use of\nthe new standard). We further noted our belief that this approach can help to reduce the burden\non health IT developers and health care providers and could allow health IT developers to\nimplement updates in the manner most appropriate for their product and customers (85 FR\n25665). We have received significant positive feedback expressing that the incremental approach\nto updates is generally beneficial as a long-term approach. Specifically, feedback conveyed that a\nconsistent, transparent, incremental update cycle that includes the following features would be\npreferred by some: 1) regular updates to recognize standards advancement and an allowance for\nvoluntary standards advancement between updates, 2) incremental updates rather than\n“wholesale” product overhauls, 3) a predictable timeline for updates based on standards\ndevelopment cycles with reasonable development timelines, and 4) a reasonable development\ntimeline for any new criterion based on specific development needs. We plan to issue clear\nguidance and timelines for when updates would be required. In consideration of the overall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupport from commenters, we have finalized our proposed approach to discontinue the use of\nyear themed editions for ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT.\n\nIn response to commenters that indicated we did not provide adequate specificity or\neducation in our HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we appreciate the commenters’ concerns and agree with\nthe need for educational materials and resources. We intend to make updates to ONC website\nmaterials, engage in public presentations and webinars, and revise the Certified Health IT\nProduct List (CHPL) database to make clear which certification criteria, standards, and\nimplementation specifications are valid under the Program at a given point in time. Between the\nONC website and the CHPL updates, we are confident that interested parties will have the\nnecessary information regarding both certification criteria and certified health IT products. We\nwill also develop educational resources so that purchasers and users understand which Health IT\nModules have met their obligations under the Program by updating their Health IT Modules to\nrevised certification criteria.\n\nIn response to the commenter suggestion that ONC add a requirement for developers to\ninform health care providers of the meaning of a “provider product” and the consequences for\ndeclining updates to health IT regarding participation in federal reporting programs, we thank the\ncommenter for their comment. However, we have not proposed any requirements related to the\nterm, “provider product,” and decline to finalize any such requirements in this final rule.\n\nAlthough we are not at this time requiring developers to inform health care providers of the\nconsequences of declining updates to health IT, we encourage developers to be transparent with\ncustomers about the benefits of updates and impacts of declining them. We understand there are\ncosts associated with updating new technology and also with foregoing participation in a federal\nprogram that requires the use of certified health IT. Therefore, we encourage developers to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nensure that their customers are fully informed about all impacts before making a decision on\nupdates.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested further clarity on issues related to the impact\nof the proposed approach on public health entities. Commenters noted that an approach should\ninclude an “expiration date” or identify minimum standards to ensure public health and other\nentities receiving data from certified health IT do not maintain support for outdated standards.\n\nCommenters also stated that the proposed approach should recognize the cost and\nimplementation burden for public health agencies associated with updating standards, and that all\nregulatory impact analyses, including for the current rule, should include estimated costs for\npublic health agencies, laboratories, and their intermediaries. Further, commenters recommended\nmore attention on public input procedures, including from public health, and asked ONC to\nensure that regulations do not update standards without verifying that public health authorities\ncan meet the updated standards. Finally, one commenter suggested that ONC reference the\nauthority of state, local, and territorial public health agencies within the standards update process\nto ensure clarity for users.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We have identified in several places\nwithin 45 CFR part 170 subpart B, and within several certification criteria in 45 CFR part 170\nsubpart C, “expiration dates” and dates after which a standard or certification criterion is no\nlonger valid within the context of the Program. We believe these dates will ensure public health\nand other entities receiving data from certified health IT do not maintain support for outdated\nstandards. We understand concerns about the broader overall downstream impact of this\nrulemaking on entities beyond developers of certified health IT, which are specifically regulated\nunder authorities delegated to ONC. This rule’s impact analysis measures the estimated costs for\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers of certified health IT to meet new Program requirements, for example, to develop or\nmodify the technical functionality of their certified health IT or adopt a new standard or standard\nversion. These are the expected direct costs of the rule’s final policies on developers of certified\nhealth IT. However, we recognize that developers of certified health IT are largely private\nbusinesses that operate in a competitive marketplace and that they may not bear all costs to meet\nthese requirements. We include in the “Costs and Benefits” section of the Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis the estimated impact on certified health IT end users. In this case, health care providers,\nsuch as hospitals and clinicians. We believe these estimates provide a general, but not necessarily\ncomprehensive, understanding of the possible pass-through costs borne by users of certified\nhealth IT.\n\nWe also plan to issue educational resources explaining, consistent with standards and\ntimelines adopted in this rule, when updates would be required. In addition, we actively engage\nwith public health agencies to ensure that the regulatory process for updating standards\nrepresents their input. Finally, we indicate the authority of state, local, and territorial laws and\nrequirements where appropriate.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that they did not support the change to an “edition-\nless” format because the availability of the Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP)\nallows health IT developers to upgrade to approved standards on a voluntary basis. The\ncommenter urged ONC to consider the following steps to mitigate burden on health IT\ndevelopers: provide a minimum implementation time of 24 months for any new or updated\ncriteria, utilize the SVAP process over required updates where feasible, accept “evidence-based”\nattestations for the purposes of certification, and work with other HHS agencies on awareness\naround updates to certification criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* As noted above, we plan to issue educational resources explaining, consistent\nwith standards and timelines adopted in this rule, when updates would be required. In the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule, as part of the Real World Testing Condition of Certification, we finalized\na “flexibility” within the associated Maintenance of Certification that we refer to as the SVAP\n(85 FR 25775). This flexibility permits health IT developers to voluntarily use newer versions of\nadopted standards in their certified Health IT Modules so long as certain conditions are met.\n\nThese conditions are not limited to, but notably include, successful real world testing of the\nHealth IT Module using the new version(s) subsequent to the inclusion of these newer standards\nand implementation specification versions in the Health IT Module's certification. We\nestablished the SVAP not only to meet the Cures Act's goals for interoperability, but also in\nresponse to the feedback ONC has received through prior rulemakings and engagements, which\nadvocated for ONC to establish a predictable and timely approach within the Program to keep\npace with the industry's standards development efforts (85 FR 25775). We continue to support\nthe SVAP, but we also believe it is necessary to discontinue the use of year-themed editions for\nONC Certification Criteria for Health IT and adopt incremental updates to the Program. While\nSVAP allows flexibility for the voluntary adoption of newer versions of standards, the\nincremental Program updates will ensure aligned minimum requirements within the health IT\nindustry that advance interoperability.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that moving to an “edition-less” approach would\nrequire ONC-ACBs to provide increased oversight to ensure certified health IT meets the\nspecific compliance dates provided in regulation. Another commenter stated that ONC should\nprovide a minimum of six months for developers and ONC-ACBs to implement this change,\nsuch as removing references to the 2015 Edition from documentation related to the Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback; however, we disagree that moving to\nan “edition-less” approach will require ONC-ACBs to conduct more oversight than under the\nedition-based construct. We note that while an “edition-less” approach may require different\nlevels of documentation of oversight than currently exist in the Program, this approach will also\nlikely reduce documentation and oversight in other areas given that health IT developers will not\nupdate Health IT Modules to all certification criteria at once, which was the case under the\nedition-based approach.\n\n*Comments.* All comments received were supportive of revising the text from “time-\nlimited certification and certification status for certain 2015 Edition certification criteria” in §\n170.550(m) to “time-limited certification and certification status for certain ONC Certification\nCriteria for Health IT.” Commenters noted that our proposal for time-limited certification should\nrequire products be clearly labeled and advertised as time-limited and include a description of\nwhich aspects of the product/certification are time-limited. Additionally, commenters requested\nwe make a filterable tag in the CHPL and/or provide a list of the time-limited products\nseparately.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters, and we have\nfinalized the removal of “2015 Edition” from § 170.550(m). We look forward to ongoing\ncollaboration with public and private sector partners as we implement the provisions of this final\nrule.\n\nAfter consideration of these comments, we have finalized our proposed approach to\ndiscontinue year-themed editions. Specifically, we have renamed § 170.315 as the “ONC\nCertification Criteria for Health IT” and replaced references to the “2015 Edition” in §§ 170.102,\n170.405, 170.406, 170.523, 170.524, and 170.550, with this description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The goal is to simplify the process, reduce confusion, and avoid the implication that criteria are outdated simply due to the year in the name. This change means that unchanged criteria won't be repeatedly listed under new editions, easing the maintenance of product certifications for developers. All references to the '2015 Edition' in the regulations have been replaced with 'ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT.' The ONC believes this will create stability for users and partners, and reduce administrative burdens for developers. They plan to provide clear guidance and educational resources to help stakeholders understand the updates and ensure that public health entities do not support outdated standards.",

              "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we described the use of terms meant to describe the status of\ncertification criteria for use in the Program from the 2011 to 2014 Edition transition (88 FR\n23760). We also referenced the definitions finalized in the 2015 Edition Final Rule for the\nfollowing terms:\n• “New” certification criteria are those that as a whole only include capabilities never\nreferenced in previously adopted certification criteria editions and to which a Health IT\nModule presented for certification to the 2015 Edition could have never previously been\ncertified.\n\n• “Revised” certification criteria are those that include the capabilities referenced in a\npreviously adopted edition of certification criteria as well as changed or additional new\ncapabilities; and to which a Health IT Module presented for certification to the 2015\nEdition could not have been previously certified to all of the included capabilities.\n\n• “Unchanged” certification criteria are those that include the same capabilities as\ncompared to prior certification criteria of adopted editions; and to which a Health IT\nModule presented for certification to the 2015 Edition could have been previously\ncertified to all the included capabilities (80 FR 62608).\n\nWe proposed that these same terms as applied to the certification criteria would continue\nto be used by the Program in the absence of a year-named edition. However, for clarity, we\nproposed to define “revised certification criterion (or criteria)” in § 170.102 to mean a\ncertification criterion that meets at least one of the following: (1) has added or changed the\ncapabilities described in the existing criterion in 45 CFR 170 part C; (2) has an added or changed\nstandard or implementation specification referenced in the existing criterion in 45 CFR part 170\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubpart B; or (3) is specified through notice and comment rulemaking as an iterative or\nreplacement version of an existing criterion in 45 CFR part 170 subpart C.\n\nWe stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we would continue to use these terms when:\ncommunicating proposals for future criteria, such as revising a criterion that will maintain its\nplace in the CFR or establishing a new criterion that is an iterative or replacement criterion in the\nProgram; establishing scenarios for when gap certification is an option for developers of certified\nhealth IT; and setting expiration dates or applicable timelines related to standards and\ncertification criteria. Through the development of educational resources, such as fact sheets24\nand\nresource guides,<sup>25</sup>\nthese designations will help users and the public understand to which versions\nof standards and certification criteria a Health IT Module may be certified when multiple\nversions of standards or certification criteria are available under the Program. In the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, we proposed applicability or implementation timelines for both our certification\ncriteria and the standards adopted in 45 CFR part 170 by establishing the dates by which an\nexisting version of a criterion or standard is no longer applicable and by establishing a date by\nwhich a new or revised certification criterion or standard version is adopted (88 FR 23760).\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters supported our proposed definition of “revised certification\ncriterion (or criteria).”\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We believe the revised\ncertification criterion (or criteria) definition provides clarity around our approach for setting\napplicability or implementation timelines for both our certification criteria and the standards\n\n\nFootnote 24:\nSee 2015 Edition Cures Update Fact Sheet: https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2022-03/Cures-\nUpdate-Fact-Sheet.pdf.\n\n\nFootnote 25:\nSee API Resource Guide: https://onc-healthit.github.io/api-resource-guide/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadopted in 45 CFR part 170. We have finalized our definition for revised certification criterion\n(or criteria) as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested better coordination with the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that our definition is consistent and aligned with\nthe Medicare Promoting Interoperability (PI) Program or MIPS Promoting Interoperability\nperformance category.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and will continue to coordinate and work with our\nfederal partners, including CMS, on points of intersection for potential future rulemaking. We\nnote that the CY 2024 Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule<sup>26</sup>\nhas a discussion related to this\npolicy, and we invite readers to review the discussion at 88 FR 52547.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter inquired how users of a certified Health IT Module that has\nbeen certified to multiple certification criteria that have been revised and included overlapping\ntimeframes for standards updates will know if the Health IT Module is compliant.\n\n*Response.* ONC has included in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) revisions to\ncertification criteria, standards, and implementation specifications—and their associated\ntimelines. To meet a certification requirement, a Health IT Module would need to be updated to\nthe most recently adopted capabilities and standards indicated in the CFR within the timelines\nspecified. For example, if a finalized revised certification criterion references a new standard this\nyear that must be adopted by 2027, and we subsequently revised this certification criterion\nthrough rulemaking again in 2026 with a newer version of that standard to be adopted by 2028,\n\n\nFootnote 26:\n“Medicare and Medicaid Programs; CY 2024 Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule and Other\nChanges to Part B Payment and Coverage Policies; Medicare Shared Savings Program Requirements; Medicare\nAdvantage; Medicare and Medicaid Provider and Supplier Enrollment Policies; and Basic Health Program” (88 FR\n52262).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen the Health IT Module would need to be updated to the new standard identified this year in\nthe CFR by 2027 and subsequently be updated to the standard identified through rulemaking in\n2026 by 2028.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter inquired how an update to an existing criterion will be\nidentified on the CHPL.\n\n*Response.* ONC will establish clear requirements and timelines for all revised criteria\nwithin the CHPL. To support effective communication of the updates, we will implement a\npractical approach to facilitate transparency using the CHPL.\n\nTable 1 below includes the revised certification criteria we have finalized in this rule.\n\nTable 1: List of Finalized Health IT Certification Criteria\nRevised Certification Criteria\n§ 170.315(a)(5) Clinical – Patient demographics and observations (currently\nDemographics)\n§ 170.315(a)(9) Clinical – Clinical decision support (CDS) at § 170.315(a)(9) (to be\nmoved to the “Care Coordination” certification criteria as the\n“decision support intervention” criterion at § 170.315(b)(11)”)\n§ 170.315(b)(1) Care Coordination – Transitions of care\n§ 170.315(e)(1) Patient Engagement – View, download, and transmit to 3rd party\n§ 170.315(f)(5) Public Health – Transmission to public health agencies – electronic\ncase reporting\n§ 170.315(g)(10) Design and Performance – Standardized API for patient and\npopulation services\nRevised Certification Criteria (standards updates)\n§ 170.315(a)(12) Clinical – Family health history\n§ 170.315(b)(2) Care Coordination – Clinical information reconciliation and\nincorporation\n§ 170.315(b)(6) Care Coordination – Data export\n§ 170.315(b)(9) Care Coordination – Care plan\n§ 170.315(c)(4) Clinical Quality Measures – Clinical quality measures – filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(f)(1) Public Health – Transmission to immunization registries.\n\n§ 170.315(f)(3) Public Health – Transmission to public health agencies – reportable\nlaboratory tests and values/results\n§ 170.315(f)(4) Public Health – Transmission to cancer registries\n§ 170.315(g)(3) Design and Performance – Safety-enhanced design\n§ 170.315(g)(6) Design and Performance – Consolidated CDA creation performance\n§ 170.315(g)(9) Design and Performance – Application access – all data request\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we included proposed modifications to our approach for\nsetting applicability or implementation timelines for each certification criteria and the applicable\nstandards adopted in 45 CFR part 170 (88 FR 23761).

Specifically, we clarified that the records retention\nprovisions in §§ 170.523 and 170.524 included the “life of the edition” as well as three years\nafter the retirement of an edition related to the certification of Complete EHRs and Health IT\nModules. We explained that “[b]ecause the ‘life of the edition’ begins with the codification of an\n\n\n\n\n\n\nedition of certification criteria in the CFR and ends on the effective date of the final rule that\nremoves the applicable edition from the CFR, the start and end dates for the ‘life of the edition’\nare published in the Federal Register in the rulemaking actions that finalize them. The period of\nthree years beyond the ‘life of the edition’ begins on the effective date of the final rule that\nremoves the applicable edition from the CFR, thus the three-year period after removal from the\nCFR continues through three full calendar years following that date” (85 FR 25710).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to maintain a single set of “ONC Certification\nCriteria for Health IT” and not an edition, so we therefore proposed to revise § 170.523 and §\n170.524 (88 FR 23762). We proposed that the period of three years begins on the effective date\nof the final rule that removes the applicable ONC certification criterion or criteria for health IT\nfrom the CFR, thus the three-year period after removal from the CFR continues through three\nfull calendar years following that date (in addition to the calendar year in which it was removed).\n\nWe also retained the “Complete EHR” language in these sections because beginning with the\n2015 Edition, Complete EHR certifications could no longer be issued. However, since the 2014\nEdition was not removed from the CFR until the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, which became\neffective on June 30, 2020, records would need to be retained (including Complete EHRs) until\nJune 30, 2023.\n\n*Comments.* A majority of commenters, including individuals, professional trade\nassociations, and other interested parties expressed support for the ONC-ATLs retaining the\nrecords of Complete EHRs’ and Health IT Modules’ testing through a minimum of three years\nfrom the effective date of the removal of those certification criteria from the CFR. Commenters\nindicated such requirements were reasonable, particularly in relation to the retirement of the\nedition concept, and they indicated that these records could better facilitate surveillance and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenforcement of certification criteria and transparency for customers. One commenter highlighted\nthe importance of retaining those records for historical documentation regarding their health IT\nvendors’ certification status. One commenter suggested ONC expand the three-year requirement\nto six years, to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s retention period.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters' support for continuing our current three-year\nretention policy and our proposed modifications that the retention policy would be effective for\nthree full calendar years beginning on the effective date of the final rule that removes the\napplicable ONC certification criterion or criteria for health IT from the CFR. We agree that\nmaintaining those records for historical documentation is important and have finalized our policy\nas proposed. We do not believe that a six-year retention policy is needed at this time because it\nmay result in more burden than is warranted. However, we will continue to monitor the\neffectiveness of our existing retention policy and consider changes as needed, including\nconsulting with Federal partners that conduct federal program enforcement, such as the HHS\nOIG.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested ONC establish an organized system of documentation\nmanagement for each Health IT Module/developer to be shared on the CHPL to streamline the\nprocess and enhance efficiency; to adopt new indicators of current certification status each time a\ncriterion certified as part of a Health IT Module is incrementally updated; and to create a special\ncoding system that represents the most current year of certification for Health IT Modules to\nsupport oversight and compliance requirements health care providers may have with other\nprograms such as the CMS Quality Payment Program.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters identifying options for enhancing how the Program\ndocuments certification status for Health IT Modules as we retire the year-themed edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\napproach. We note that the CHPL primarily serves as a comprehensive repository of certified\nhealth IT products and their corresponding certification details. While it provides information\nabout certified health IT products, it does not specifically serve as a documentation management\nsystem for Modules/developers. The CHPL provides transparency and access to certification\ninformation, including the certification criteria used for certifying a Health IT Module, test\nresults, and certified health IT product details. It serves as a valuable resource for users to verify\nthe certification status and capabilities of Health IT products. Overall, we will take these\ncomments, and related comments received, into consideration as we implement removal of year-\nthemed editions in the Program.\n\n\n",

The NTTAA\nand OMB Circular A-119 provide exceptions to electing only standards developed or adopted by\nvoluntary consensus bodies, namely when doing so would be inconsistent with applicable law or\notherwise impractical. Agencies have the discretion to decline the use of existing voluntary\nconsensus standards if it is determined that such standards are inconsistent with applicable law or\notherwise impractical, and instead use a government-unique standard or other standard. In\naddition to the consideration of voluntary consensus standards, the OMB Circular A-119\nrecognizes the contributions of standardization activities that take place outside of the voluntary\nconsensus standards process. Therefore, in instances where use of voluntary consensus standards\nwould be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impracticable, other standards should be\nconsidered that meet the agency’s regulatory, procurement, or program needs, deliver favorable\ntechnical and economic outcomes, and are widely utilized in the marketplace.\n\nIn this final rule, we use voluntary consensus standards except for:\n• The standard adopted in § 170.213, the United States Core Data for Interoperability\nVersion 3 (USCDI v3), is a hybrid of government policy (i.e., determining which data to\ninclude in the USCDI) and voluntary consensus standards (i.e., the vocabulary and code\nset standards attributed to USCDI data elements); and\n• The standard adopted in § 170.207(f)(3) for race and ethnicity.\n\n\nFootnote 27:\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_1_22.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are not aware of any voluntary consensus standards that could serve as an alternative\nfor the purposes we describe in further detail throughout this final rule including establishing a\nbaseline set of data that can be exchanged across care settings for a wide range of uses.

USCDI v1 established a baseline set of data that can be commonly\nexchanged across care settings for a wide range of uses and is a required part of certification\ncriteria in the 2015 Edition Cures Update. For the overall structure and organization of USCDI,\nincluding data classes and data elements in USCDI v1, please see the discussion in the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25669 – 25670), as well as www.healthIT.gov/uscdi.\n\n\nFootnote 28:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that we intended to utilize a predictable,\ntransparent, and collaborative process to expand USCDI, including providing the public with the\nopportunity to comment on USCDI’s expansion (85 FR 25670). We also noted that developers of\ncertified health IT would be able to use the Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP) to\nvoluntarily implement and use a newer, National Coordinator-approved version of USCDI\nwithout waiting for ONC to propose and adopt via rulemaking an updated version of the USCDI\n(85 FR 25669). We, therefore, established a process for expanding USCDI based on public input\nand submissions of new data elements and classes.<sup>29</sup>\nTo enable these submissions, we created the\nONC New Data Element and Class (ONDEC) submission system, which provides the public\nwith the opportunity to submit new data elements for consideration for inclusion in future\nversions of USCDI.<sup>30</sup>\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to update the USCDI standard in § 170.213 by\nadopting the newly released USCDI v3 and establishing a January 1, 2025, expiration date for\nUSCDI v1 (July 2020 Errata) for purposes of the Program. We proposed to add USCDI v3 in §\n170.213(b) and incorporate it by reference in § 170.299. Specifically, we proposed in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule to adopt USCDI v3 (October 2022 Errata). We also proposed to codify the\nexisting reference to USCDI v1 (July 2020 Errata) in § 170.213(a). Lastly, we proposed that as\nof January 1, 2025, any developers seeking certification for their Health IT Modules to criteria\nthat reference the standards in § 170.213 would need to be capable of exchanging the data\nelements that comprise USCDI v3.\n\n\nFootnote 29:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/uscdi-onc-new-data-element-and-class-submission-system-\nnow-available.\n\n\nFootnote 30:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/ONDEC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We received a large number of comments expressing overall support for our\nproposals to adopt USCDI v3 in § 170.213(b) and for USCDI v1 to expire on January 1, 2025.\n\nMany commenters specifically supported the inclusion of SDOH data elements in USCDI v3 and\nnoted that more accurate and complete patient characteristics will help address health disparities.\n\nSeveral commenters in support of our proposals specifically agreed with the proposed deadline.\n\nCommenters supporting our proposal also noted that it would reduce burden, advance\ninteroperability, support quality measurement initiatives, and support providers’ ability to\nacquire and share the information needed to provide the best care for their patients.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the support of our proposals and for recognizing\npotential benefits such as reduced burden, increased interoperability, more complete data, and\nthe ability to support quality measurement initiatives and better address health disparities.\n\n*Comments.* We received numerous comments that expressed concern about the proposed\ndeadline and advocated for an extension. These comments generally expressed concern about the\nburden on developers posed by the proposed deadline, stating that more time would be needed to\nsuccessfully adopt USCDI v3, including development, implementation, and testing, and stressed\nthat it would be a large undertaking for developers as well as for health care providers. Some\ncommenters recommended moving the deadline to the end of the calendar year which is no\nshorter than 24 months from the publication of this final rule. Some commenters suggested\nextending the compliance deadline by six months, and others suggested compliance dates of\nDecember 31, 2025, or January 1, 2026. Several commenters mentioned the need for ONC to\ncoordinate with CMS on timelines, and one mentioned the need to allow providers a “flex” year\nafter the certification deadline during which to upgrade. Some comments suggested aligning\ncompliance deadlines with the availability of scalable FHIR-based API standards, which they\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstated could help support successful implementation of USCDI v3, while others suggested\nwaiting to adopt USCDI v3 until after Release 4 of the C-CDA Companion Guide is finalized.\n\nSome commenters stated that USCDI v3 should not be required until all of the standards\nsupporting USCDI v3 are officially published.\n\nAdditionally, a number of commenters requested clarification from ONC related to the\nproposed adoption of USCDI v3. This included clarification on future updates to USCDI; how\nUSCDI works with CMS rules and programs; the applicability of USCDI v2 once USCDI v3 is\nadopted; the distinction between USCDI, USCDI+ and US Core; the lack of vocabulary\nstandards for some USCDI v3 data elements; and the expectations regarding data sharing.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for expressing a desire for an extension on proposed\ndeadlines. USCDI v3 includes all data elements in USCDI v2, as well as additional data\nelements. In response to commenters’ feedback, we have extended the deadline for the expiration\nof USCDI v1 in § 170.213 to January 1, 2026. We believe the extended time, combined with the\nfact that USCDI v3 has been publicly available since July 2022, will make it feasible for all\ninterested parties to meet the revised deadline. We note that USCDI v3 has been available for use\nin the Program using the FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 through\nSVAP effective September 11, 2023.<sup>31</sup>\nIn response to comments suggesting that USCDI v3 lacks\nvocabulary standards, in the USCDI v3 standard ONC has identified applicable vocabulary\nstandards for those USCDI data elements where a coded value is expected, a standard code set is\ncurrently in use, and where the submitters and commenters have provided evidence of current\n\n\nFootnote 31:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/2023_SVAP_Fact_Sheet.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse. Further terminology bindings are defined in the C-CDA Companion Guide and HL7 US\nCore Implementation Guide.\n\nIn response to the comment requesting that ONC explain the distinction between\nUSCDI, USCDI+, and US Core, we note that the USCDI+ program was not referenced in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule. USCDI+ supports the identification and establishment of domain or\nprogram-specific datasets that will operate as extensions to USCDI and uses similar processes as\nthe USCDI, such as seeking input from the Health IT Advisory Committee and other interested\npartners to stimulate public engagement and help shape USCDI+ datasets.\n\nAs we have described previously, the USCDI is a standardized set of health data classes\nand constituent data elements for nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. In\norder for the USCDI to be implemented with specific exchange modalities or functionalities,\nadditional specifications are required to provide guidance on how the USCDI should be\nimplemented in the context of that exchange method. The US Core and C-CDA implementation\nguides are aligned to specific versions of USCDI and provide the implementation specification\nand expectations for each particular version of USCDI. In this case, we have finalized USCDI v3\nand the applicable FHIR US Core Implementation Guide (FHIR US Core 6.1.0) and C-CDA\nCompanion Guide (C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1), both of which provide guidance on how to\nimplement the updates from USCDI v1 to USCDI v3.\n\nWe recognize that we stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we would consider adopting\nthe most up-to-date versions of the FHIR US Core and C-CDA Companion Guide specifications\nthat align with the updates to USCDI v3 (FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide\nR4). However, after the publishing of FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4,\nHL7 found errors with how the guides implemented data elements in USCDI v3 and had to make\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdates to those specifications to align with USCDI v3 and ensure that USCDI v3 can be\nimplemented in Health IT Modules. Adopting FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion\nGuide R4.1 is necessary for developers of certified health IT to have appropriate implementation\nguidance to meet the criteria adopted in this final rule that reference USCDI v3. Based on public\ncomments on this and prior rulemakings, we believe that the health IT industry, healthcare\nstandards developers, and health care providers expect and support ONC making such\ndeterminations so that the adopted version of standards are the most up-to-date available and are\nfeasible for real-world implementation (see, for example, 85 FR 25677 and 25708).\n\nIn response to comments regarding how CMS or other federal programs incorporate\nUSCDI into rules and programs, we note that ONC receives submissions and comments from\nfederal partners, including CMS, on USCDI content and will continue to work towards\nalignment where appropriate with these partners.\n\nIn response to comments on future updates to USCDI, we clarify that USCDI generally\nexpands annually to keep pace with clinical, technology, and policy changes.<sup>32</sup>\nONC follows a\npredictable, transparent, and collaborative process for updating USCDI that allows interested\nparties to submit new data elements and classes for future versions of USCDI through the\nONDEC submission system. Regarding applicability, USCDI v2 will not be available for new\nand updating certifications via SVAP after December 31, 2023. We erroneously stated in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule that USCDI v2 would remain available via SVAP until December 31, 2024\n(88 FR 23764); however, our intention was that USCDI v2 would remain available via SVAP\n\n\nFootnote 32:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2023-07/Standards_Bulletin_2023-2.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil it sunsets. USCDI v2 sunsets on December 31, 2023 and will no longer be available via\nSVAP after that date.<sup>33</sup>\nComments. We received numerous comments expressing concerns about privacy and the\nimplementation of USCDI v3. These commenters generally noted that USCDI v3 includes data\nelements that may contain sensitive health information, including mental health, substance use,\nand reproductive health information, the disclosure of which could increase the risk of\nharassment or harm toward providers and patients. Several of these commenters noted the need\nfor ONC to create education materials around the fact that USCDI v3 does not require sharing of\nsensitive information. Some commenters recommended that ONC remove data elements that\nprovide personally identifiable information that does not support the provision of care. Several\ncomments encouraged ONC to consider requiring granular data segmentation policies\nconcurrently with adopting USCDI v3. Commenters also requested that ONC consider removing\nany personally identifiable data elements in USCDI that do not provide value in order to avoid\nre-identification, or alternatively to revise policies that require automatic inclusion of all data\nelements in the USCDI.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback regarding the importance of\naddressing the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. The adoption of USCDI v3\nsets a new baseline for the capability of Health IT Modules certified to particular certification\ncriteria to capture and exchange data but does not dictate when and how either of those two\nactions occur. We have not adopted new or additional privacy standards related to controlling\nsensitive data that may be represented in USCDI data elements. However, our existing criteria in\n\n\nFootnote 33:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-version-advancement-process-svap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(b)(7) and (b)(8) include support for privacy and security labels in health information\nexchange workflows and these criteria reference the HL7®\nImplementation Guide: Data\nSegmentation for Privacy (DS4P), Release 1 adopted in § 170.205(o)(1) and incorporated by\nreference in § 170.299. In addition, we have adopted a new requirement as part of the\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) in support of the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s individuals’\n“right to request a restriction” as discussed in section III.C.10. For more on patient requested\nrestrictions on sharing of their health information, we refer readers to section III.C.10 for\ndiscussion on modifications to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification\ncriterion in § 170.315(e)(1), stating that patients (and their authorized representatives) must be\nable to use an internet-based method to request a restriction to be applied for any data expressed\nin the standards in § 170.213. The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for PHI\nheld by covered entities and gives individuals an array of rights with respect to that information.\n\n*Comments.* We received multiple comments expressing concern about provider burden,\nincluding administrative, cognitive, and documentation burden associated with USCDI data\nelements. Some commenters also expressed concerns about the cost burden of implementing\nUSCDI v3, noting that it could require numerous downstream standards updates, migration costs,\ncosts to standardize and use unconstrained data, and costs related to software, IT infrastructure,\nworkforce recruiting and training, and ongoing operational costs. Several commenters were\nparticularly concerned about the potential costs to public health organizations and to small and\nrural providers, which may have limited budgets or resources to devote to the implementation of\nEHR systems capable of collecting and sharing data according to the USCDI v3 standard.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested that ONC provide resources and support to providers to help\nreduce provider burden. One commenter proposed a test or pilot to ensure that burdens are not\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshifted to providers when USCDI v3 is implemented. Another commenter proposed that ONC\nconsider regulations to prevent developers of certified health IT from increasing fees due to the\nupdate to USCDI v3.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback regarding implementation burden and\nthe adoption of USCDI v3. As we have noted, the adoption of USCDI v3 sets a new baseline for\nthe capability of Health IT Modules certified to particular certification criteria to capture and\nexchange data. USCDI v3 does not dictate when and how either of those two actions occur,\nincluding with what frequency health care providers document information that could be\ncaptured as part of the data elements within USCDI v3. We also note that we have established a\npredictable, transparent, and collaborative expansion process for USCDI based on public\nevaluation of previous versions and submissions by the health IT community. Each of the data\nelements in USCDI v3 has been evaluated for overall value, maturity, and ease of\nimplementation. In addition, the data elements (as applicable) are represented by health IT\nstandard terminologies, technical specifications, or implementation guides, and are used\nextensively in production electronic systems. We intend to provide implementation resources\nsuch as implementation guide validators for both HL7 C-CDA and FHIR corresponding\nimplementation guides to USCDI v3. However, we decline to conduct a test pilot or create\nadditional regulations focused on burden and USCDI v3 at this time.\n\nWe appreciate the comments related to implementation burden for rural and small\nproviders and understand concerns about the overall downstream impact of the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule on entities beyond developers of certified health IT to which ONC authorities apply. As\npart of our Regulatory Impact Analysis in section VII, we have identified that developers of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertified health IT are largely private businesses who operate in a competitive marketplace, and\nthey may not bear all costs to meet regulatory requirements.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns about data quality when USCDI v3\nis implemented and suggested that ONC work with the industry on developing standards. Several\ncommenters expressed concerns about the lack of use cases and standards related to USCDI v3\nand suggested that ONC develop those.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We work directly with HL7 to\nfinalize HL7® FHIR® US Core and C-CDA Companion Guide specifications for each published\nversion of USCDI, including USCDI v3. These specifications include terminology bindings to\nvalue sets drawn from standard code sets, where appropriate. To further support implementation\nof USCDI v3, we will update the C-CDA validator<sup>34</sup>\nand Inferno<sup>35</sup>\ntest tools to align with USCDI\nv3 and validate the quality of the data. We will continue to identify opportunities to work with\nindustry to improve data quality. For example, we recently awarded a Leading Edge\nAcceleration Project (LEAP) award to explore enabling easy access to high-quality, standardized\nhealthcare data, with a focus on USCDI in FHIR and open-source platforms.<sup>36</sup>\nComments. Several commenters expressed concern that not all data elements in USCDI\nv3 are applicable to all users and urged that ONC allow EHRs flexibility in adopting USCDI v3.\n\nThese commenters generally urged ONC to allow EHRs to add only the data elements needed by\ntheir users. Commenters also urged ONC to explore a modular approach for USCDI that would\n\n\nFootnote 34:\nhttps://site.healthit.gov/sandbox-ccda/ccda-validator\n\n\nFootnote 35:\nhttps://inferno.healthit.gov/\n\n\nFootnote 36:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2023-04/LEAP%20FY2023%20SEN_508.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup data elements to support specific use cases, noting that this would help reduce burden and\ncosts while improving care.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the input suggesting that ONC allow flexibility in\nsupporting USCDI v3 data classes and data elements for purposes of the Program. We decline to\nallow developers to be selective in which USCDI v3 data classes and data elements they support\nfor purposes of the Program. The USCDI standard is intended to provide a common set of data\nclasses and data elements in support of nationwide health information exchange, therefore,\npartial adoption of the USCDI standard would impact the effectiveness of the standard and\nimpede interoperability. Additionally, we recognize that not all USCDI v3 data elements\noriginate in an EHR, however Health IT Modules certified to particular certification criteria must\nbe able to capture and exchange the values when available.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that ONC establish a framework for certification\nof specialty EHRs and non-EHRs to help promote USCDI uptake across the care continuum.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their suggestion that ONC establish a framework\nfor certification to support specialty EHRs and non-EHRs to promote USCDI uptake across the\ncare continuum. At this time, we decline to provide selective certification frameworks for\npurposes of the Program. The USCDI standard is intended to provide a common set of data\nclasses and data elements in support of nationwide health information exchange.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed a preference for USCDI v4 over USCDI v3,\nnoting that it will help the healthcare marketplace and encourage competition. One comment\nencouraged ONC to finalize USCDI v4 in 2023 and require support by the end of 2024.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the comments in support of USCDI v4. However,\nwe did not propose, and therefore decline to adopt, USCDI v4 in the USCDI standards in §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.213 at this time. We have adopted USCDI v3 in § 170.213(b) as proposed. Additionally, we\nnote that implementation guides are not yet released to support USCDI v4.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters generally encouraged ONC to work with CMS on\ntimelines and on alignment with program requirements, including aligning future USCDI updates\nwith CMS programs.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the comments regarding working with CMS and\nassure commenters that we work closely with CMS across multiple programs and initiatives on\naligning program requirements and deadlines. We will continue to do so in the future. Those\nCMS programs include, but are not limited to, the Quality Payment Program, Inpatient Quality\nReporting Program, and Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program, as well as regulatory\nproposals such as the Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule (87 FR 76238).<sup>37</sup>\nComments. Several commenters encouraged ONC to maintain awareness of state agency\ndata exchange requirements and to work to alleviate discrepancies, noting that the variances in\nUSCDI versioning pose challenges industry-wide if not aligned with state and federal\nregulations.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the comments regarding state agency data exchange\nrequirements and assure commenters that we monitor and are aware of state and federal\nregulations impacting adoption of USCDI v3.\n\n\nFootnote 37:\n“Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Advancing Interoperability and\nImproving Prior Authorization Processes for Medicare Advantage Organizations, Medicaid Managed Care Plans,\nState Medicaid Agencies, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Agencies and CHIP Managed Care Entities,\nIssuers of Qualified Health Plans on the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges, Merit-Based Incentive Payment System\n(MIPS) Eligible Clinicians, and Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals in the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program.” (87 FR 76238).

We maintain a variety of resources and technical\nsupport related to USCDI, including numerous resources related to the Program. Resources\ninclude Certification Companion Guides (CCGs) and Test Procedures related to specific\ncertification criterion to assist developers that are seeking to certify to the criteria.<sup>38</sup>\nAny\nconsiderations for implementing USCDI in compliance with these criteria are, additionally,\noutlined in these resources. In addition, there is a USCDI CCG that includes clarifications for\nspecific data classes and elements as they relate to terminology standards and/or implementation\nguides. The Program offers testing and conformance methods for verification that a product\nmeets criteria requirements. Other technical documentation may be found on ONC’s website:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/uscdi.\n\n*Comments.* There were also a number of commenters that made suggestions for future\nversions of USCDI. Commenters suggested improving the USCDI interface and allowing\n\n\nFootnote 38:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/certification-health-it\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomment on proposed value sets. Various commenters suggested adding specific data elements\nin future versions of USCDI, including the following:\n• marital status\n• education\n• water insecurity\n• value-based care\n• prescription drug insurance information\n• advance directive documentation\n• clinical orders\n• care experience preference\n• newborn delivery information\n• vaccine administration date\n• vaccination event record type\n• medical record number\n• mother’s maiden name\n• multiple birth indicator\n• birth order\nResponse. We thank commenters for the feedback and suggestions regarding future\nversions of USCDI. The USCDI v3 is a published standard at\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/isa/files/2022-10/USCDI-Version-3-October-2022-Errata-\nFinal.pdf and thus it is not possible to add new data elements to USCDI v3 through the\nrulemaking process or other means at this time. We direct commenters to the USCDI website,\n\n\n\n\n\n\navailable at https://www.healthit.gov/uscdi, where the public is invited to enter comments on\nleveled data elements or submit new data elements for consideration in future versions of\nUSCDI.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "As discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, the USCDI standard is currently cross-\nreferenced, via cross-reference to § 170.213, in certain certification criteria (88 FR 23763). The\ncriteria cross-referencing to USCDI via cross-reference to § 170.213 are as follows:\n• “Care coordination—Transitions of care—Create” (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1));\n• “Care coordination—Clinical information reconciliation and incorporation—\nReconciliation” (§ 170.315(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1) through (3));\n• “Patient engagement—View, download, and transmit to 3rd party—View”\n\n(§ 170.315(e)(1)(i)(A)(1));\n• “Design and performance—Consolidated CDA creation performance”\n\n(§ 170.315(g)(6)(i)(A));\n• “Design and performance—Application access—all data request—Functional\nrequirements” (§ 170.315(g)(9)(i)(A)(1)); and\n• “Design and performance—Standardized API for patient and population services—Data\nresponse” (§ 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) and (B)).\n\nWe noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that § 170.315(f)(5) also currently references\n§ 170.213; however, we proposed to rely on specific IGs for that criterion, rather than reference\n§ 170.213 (88 FR 23763). We proposed that through December 31, 2024, a Health IT Module\ncertified to the criteria above that cross-reference § 170.213 may be certified by complying with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) USCDI v1; (2) USCDI v2 under SVAP; and (3) USCDI v3 (88 FR 23763). We proposed to\nallow only USCDI v3 after this date for the criteria that cross-reference § 170.213.\n\nWe noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that a developer of certified health IT will not be\nrequired to provide technology updates for certified criteria or standards to a user who declined\nsuch updates; however, if such an update is not provided, that version of the Health IT Module\nwill no longer be considered certified under the Program (88 FR 23764).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed in the preamble to add introductory text to §\n170.213 noting that the Secretary adopts the following standards as the standards available for\nrepresenting EHI (88 FR 23764), and we proposed in the regulatory text to add introductory text\nto § 170.213 stating the Secretary adopts the following versions of the USCDI standard (88 FR\n23907). This discrepancy was inadvertent, and we clarify that we intended to propose\nintroductory text to § 170.213 stating the Secretary adopts the following versions of the USCDI\nstandard. We also proposed to include the date the adoption of the standard in § 170.213(a)\nexpires. Consistent with our proposals in sections III.A and III.C.11, we proposed this expiration\ndate to be January 1, 2025. Health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to\ncertification criteria that reference § 170.213 would have to update such certified health IT to\nUSCDI v3 and provide it to customers by December 31, 2024. Further, we proposed that Health\nIT Modules certified to the above-listed certification criteria would need to update their Health\nIT Modules to accommodate USCDI v3 data elements using the FHIR US Core Implementation\nGuide Version 5.0.1 in § 170.215(b)(1)(ii) and the HL7 CDA® R2 IG: C-CDA Templates for\nClinical Notes R2.1 Companion Guide, Release 3 in § 170.205(a)(6). We noted in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule that if the FHIR US Core Implementation Guide and the HL7 CDA® R2 IG: C–\nCDA Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Companion Guide are updated before the date of\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublication of this final rule, it would be our intent to consider adopting the updated versions that\nsupport USCDI v3.\n\nWe refer to the term “expires” in standards throughout this final rule, and it means that\nthe standard is unavailable for use in the Program, or any other programs that may cite the\nstandard, as of the expiration date.\n\nAdditionally, because we finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that the Common\nClinical Data Set (CCDS) would no longer be applicable for certified Health IT Modules 24\nmonths after the publication date of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25671), and then\nextended that date to December 31, 2022 in the interim final rule titled “Information Blocking\nand the ONC Health IT Certification Program: Extension of Compliance Dates and Timeframes\nin Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency” (85 FR 70073), we proposed to\nremove references to CCDS in the following sections of 45 CFR 170.315: §\n170.315(b)(1)(iii)(A)(2); (e)(1)(i)(A)(2); (g)(6)(i)(B); and (g)(9)(i)(A)(2). In each of those\nsections, we proposed to instead include a reference to USCDI. Because § 170.315(b)(6)(ii)(A),\nwhich also references CCDS, is still available for the period before December 31, 2023, we did\nnot propose to remove the reference to CCDS in that section.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed support for ONC’s proposals regarding\ncertification criteria that reference USCDI. Commenters stated this would support health equity\nby design, help capture more accurate and complete patient data, and help address health\ndisparities.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for support of our proposals and for recognizing the\npotential benefits. We note that the implementation guides we proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule aligned with USCDI v2, and since the publication of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, HL7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreleased updated FHIR US Core and C-CDA Companion Guides that align with the updates to\nUSCDI v3. However, after the publishing of US Core 6.0.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide 4.0,\nHL7 found errors with how the guides implemented data elements in USCDI v3 and had to make\nupdates to those specifications to align with USCDI v3 and to ensure that USCDI v3 can be\nimplemented in Health IT Modules. Given the adoption of USCDI v3, we have finalized the\nFHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1, which are the most recent versions\nthat align with USCDI v3. FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 have not\nadded any substantial functionality or requirements. We do not believe adoption of FHIR US\nCore 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 would contribute to a greater implementation\nburden, and FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 are the only versions of\ntheir respective implementation guides that fully align with and support the complete USCDI v3.\n\nAs discussed earlier in this section, we recognize that we stated in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule that we would consider adopting the most up-to-date versions of the FHIR US Core and C-\nCDA Companion Guide specifications that align with USCDI v3 FHIR US Core 6.01.0 and C-\nCDA Companion Guide R4).1. However, after the publishing of FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and C-\nCDA Companion Guide R4, HL7 found errors with how the guides implemented data elements\nin USCDI v3 and had to make updates to those specifications to align with USCDI v3 and ensure\nthat USCDI v3 can be implemented in Health IT Modules. Adopting FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-\nCDA Companion Guide R4.1 is necessary for developers of certified health IT to have\nappropriate implementation guidance to meet the criteria adopted in this final rule that reference\nUSCDI v3. Based on public comments on this and prior rulemakings, we believe that the health\nIT industry, healthcare standards developers, and health care providers expect and support ONC\nmaking such determinations so that the adopted version of standards are the most up-to-date\n\n\n\n\n\n\navailable and are feasible for real-world implementation (see, for example, 85 FR 25677 and\n25708).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested ONC should establish a more formal schedule\nfor adopting future versions of USCDI into the Program, in addition to requests for clarification\non the availability of USCDI v2 under SVAP. Commenters also recommended updating SVAP\nto allow at least two new versions of the same standard (e.g., USCDI v2 and USCDI v3) to be\navailable under SVAP at a time.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for the suggestion. Generally, ONC updates USCDI\non an annual basis, usually over the summer after an extensive public comment period. We\ndecline to adopt a more formalized schedule; however, we promote widely the availability of\ndraft versions of USCDI and engage heavily with interested parties, including the HITAC on\nnew versions. As finalized in this rule, developers of certified health IT are able to certify Health\nIT Modules to certification criteria that reference USCDI v1 until it expires on January 1, 2026.\n\nBeginning on January 1, 2026, only USCDI v3 will be available in § 170.213 as the USCDI\nstandard for use by developers of certified health IT. Under SVAP, developers of certified health\nIT had the opportunity to certify their Health IT Modules to certification criteria that reference\nUSCDI using USCDI v2 from July 2021 through December 2023. Because we approved a newer\nversion of USCDI—USCDI v3 in July 2023 as part of approved standards for 2023 SVAP—\nHealth IT Modules not already certified to USCDI v1 or v2 may adopt USCDI v3 instead.\n\nUSCDI v2 will not be available for new and updating certifications via SVAP after December\n31, 2023. In this final rule, we have codified USCDI v3 in § 170.213(b), and thus it will not be\nnecessary to use the SVAP process to advance to USCDI v3 after this final rule is effective. In\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneral, these comments are out of scope for this final rule as we did not request feedback on the\nSVAP program as part of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "SDOH<sup>39</sup>\nare the conditions in which people live, learn, work, and play, and these\nconditions affect a wide range of health and quality-of-life risks and outcomes.<sup>40</sup>\nIn the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, we stated that USCDI v3 includes four SDOH data elements that represent\naspects of SDOH data related to the use or purpose of the SDOH data rather than being based on\nthe domain (88 FR 23764). These data elements are SDOH Assessment in the Assessment and\nPlan of Treatment data class, SDOH Goals in the Goals data class, SDOH Interventions in the\nProcedures data class, and SDOH Problems/Health Concerns in the Problems data class.\n\n\nFootnote 39:\nSee SDOH Toolkit for more information, https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-\n02/Social%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20Information%20Exchange%20Toolkit%202023_508.pdf.\n\n\nFootnote 40:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/health-it-health-care-settings/social-determinants-health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed general support for inclusion of SDOH-\nrelated data elements in USCDI v3, often noting that the access, exchange, and use of these\nelements by Health IT Modules certified to particular certification criteria would support the\navailability of more information and better care for patients, as well as more equitable public\nhealth interventions.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the comments expressing support for the inclusion\nof SDOH-related data elements in USCDI v3 and for recognizing the benefits.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters did not support the inclusion of data elements related to\nSDOH at this time, stating that the proposed data elements fail to capture a comprehensive view\nof all SDOH and that there is a lack of standards related to these data elements. Commenters also\nsuggested that SDOH-related data elements only be required as part of USCDI v3 once FHIR-\nbased APIs and implementation guides are available.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their comments voicing concern that SDOH data\nelements as written in USCDI v3 are not comprehensive enough, lack standards, and should only\nbe required once FHIR-based APIs and implementation guides are available. We note that there\nare available and applicable standards. Specifically, FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA\nCompanion Guide R4.1 support USCDI v3 and align with the SDOH data elements in USCDI\nv3. We note that both FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 are incremental\nupdates which address errors and misalignments in their respective prior versions. FHIR US\nCore 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 have not added any substantial functionality or\nrequirements. We do not believe adoption of FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion\nGuide R4.1 would contribute to a greater implementation burden, and FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 are the only versions of their respective implementation guides\nthat fully align with and support the complete USCDI v3.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we recognize that we proposed different versions of the US Core\nand C-CDA Companion Guide specifications but stated that we would consider newer versions\nthat align with USCDI v3 (FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4). However,\nafter the publishing of FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4, HL7 found errors\nwith how the guides implemented data elements in USCDI v3 and had to make updates to those\nspecifications to align with USCDI v3 and ensure that USCDI v3 can be implemented in Health\nIT Modules. Adopting FHIR US Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 is necessary for\ndevelopers of certified health IT to have appropriate implementation guidance to meet the\ncriteria adopted in this final rule that reference USCDI v3. Based on public comments on this\nand prior rulemakings, we believe that the health IT industry, healthcare standards developers,\nand health care providers expect and support ONC making such determinations so that the\nadopted version of standards are the most up-to-date available and are feasible for real world\nimplementation (see, for example, 85 FR 25677 and 25708).\n\nIn addition, the HL7 Gravity Project’s Social Determinants of Health Clinical Care\nRelease 2.0.0 Implementation Guide was published in October 2022.<sup>41</sup>\nWhile the Gravity\nProject’s Social Determinants of Health Clinical Care Implementation Guide does not\nencompass all possible SDOH aspects, it does define exchange standards for multiple key\ndomains.\n\n\nFootnote 41:\nhttp://hl7.org/fhir/us/sdoh-clinicalcare/STU2/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Commenters also urged that SDOH data be protected to ensure the privacy\nand security of the information, with some commenters urging ONC to adopt granular data\nsegmentation requirements along with USCDI v3.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for noting their concerns regarding SDOH data,\nspecifically the importance of addressing the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information.\n\nThe adoption of USCDI v3 sets a new baseline for the capability of Health IT Modules certified\nto specific certification criteria to capture and exchange data but does not dictate when and how\neither of those two actions occur. We did not propose and are not adopting privacy protections or\nstandards related to controlling sensitive data that may be represented in USCDI data elements,\nincluding granular data segmentation requirements. However, we have adopted a new technical\nrequirement as part of the certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) in support of the development\nand use of technology to enable the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s individuals’ “right to request a\nrestriction” as discussed in section III.C.10. For more on patient requested restrictions on sharing\nof their health information, we refer readers to section III.C.10 on modifications to the “view,\ndownload, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) stating that\npatients (and their authorized representatives) must be able to use an internet-based method to\nrequest a restriction to be applied for any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213. As noted\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23765), in the 2015 Edition, ONC adopted a certification\ncriterion to enable users of Health IT Modules(s) certified to that criterion with the functionality\nto electronically capture, modify, and access SDOH data elements—that is information that\nidentifies common SDOH conditions in a standardized manner—in § 170.315(a)(15) social,\npsychological, and behavioral data (80 FR 62631). These functionalities are intended to support\nusers with the ability to use technology to comply with applicable existing legal requirements or\n\n\n\n\n\n\norganizational policies that may require such data collection and broader, existing industry\ninterests and efforts to collect and use this data to inform clinical decision-making and improve\npatient care by looking at the whole patient, including leveraging other types of care such as\nhome and community-based services. ONC supports the use of technology to improve the\nstandardized capture of a set of health data elements to support the healthcare industry's need to\nelectronically capture the underlying data they need or want to collect for healthcare. ONC will\ncontinue working with our federal partners in their efforts to educate interested parties, including\nboth health care providers and patients,<sup>42</sup>\nregarding the access, exchange, and use of information\nabout patients and the use of certified health IT.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that a base set of SDOH criteria for each of the\nSDOH elements be required, while optional criteria could be added based on the hospital or\nprovider’s specific situation.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their suggestion. USCDI v3 includes data\nelements for SDOH Problems/Health Concerns, SDOH Assessment, SDOH Goals, and SDOH\nInterventions. For the purposes of the Program, developers with Health IT Modules certified to\nspecific certification criteria must support all USCDI v3 data elements, including the SDOH data\nelements for Problems/Health Concerns, Assessment, Goals, and Interventions. Under these\nrequired data elements, those health IT developers may support any of the SDOH domains such\nas referrals, food insecurity, transportation, and housing security. The USCDI standard is\nintended to provide a common set of data classes and data elements to support nationwide health\n\n\nFootnote 42:\nSee e.g., https://www.healthit.gov/topic/patient-access-health-records/patient-access-health-records\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninformation exchange and interoperability, and partial adoption of the USCDI standard would\nimpair its effectiveness in doing so.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters had a variety of recommendations related to including SDOH\ndata elements in USCDI v3. Several comments suggested that ONC partner with standards\norganizations and others in the industry in developing and implementing SDOH data elements.\n\nCommenters also suggested that when developing SDOH data elements, ONC should seek input\nfrom patients and advocates representing those with health disparities. Commenters also\nsuggested that ONC work with CMS and state Medicaid agencies on capturing and sharing\nSDOH data. One commenter suggested aligning SDOH data collection across federal and state\nhealthcare program reporting requirements.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the recommendations related to including SDOH\ndata elements in USCDI v3. We work closely with the HL7 FHIR Gravity Accelerator to\ndevelop and implement SDOH data elements. We also support the HL7 Gravity Pilots Affinity\nGroup and support testing through connectathons and pilots. Throughout the spring of 2023, we\nengaged interested parties and the community in the ONC SDOH Information Exchange\nLearning Forum, resulting in the creation of an ONC SDOH Information Exchange Toolkit.<sup>43</sup>\nIn\n2021, we funded a Leading Edge Acceleration Project for Referral Management to Address\nSDOH Aligned with Clinical Care.\n\nThe HL7 FHIR Gravity Accelerator participants include individuals, patients, advocates,\nrepresentatives from payer organizations, social services organizations, health IT developers,\nprovider associations, and other government participants, including CMS.\n\n\nFootnote 43:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-\n02/Social%20Determinants%20of%20Health%20Information%20Exchange%20Toolkit%202023_508.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that ONC provide support to providers and\ntheir staff to implement SDOH data elements and ensure SDOH data is collected, used, and\nshared appropriately. Commenters suggested that education and training on SDOH data\nelements, including definitions and use cases, is needed for the industry, and several commenters\nsuggested that ONC develop standards, value sets, and mappings related to SDOH data elements.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the input regarding the need for support and\nresources. To support the adoption and implementation of SDOH data elements, ONC published\nthe SDOH Information Exchange Toolkit to further support communities working toward\nachieving health equity through SDOH information exchange and the use of interoperable,\nstandardized data. The Toolkit is intended to provide information on the exchange of SDOH\ninformation to interested parties of all experience levels, as well as identify approaches to\nadvance SDOH information exchange goals. The audience for the Toolkit includes states, payers,\nhealth care provider networks, human services providers, and community-based services entities.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter sought clarification regarding the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program requirements and the SDOH Problems/Health data element and whether\nthere is a need for an option to indicate “None.”\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback seeking clarification regarding the\nMedicare Promoting Interoperability Program requirements for the SDOH Problems/Health data\nelement. ONC refers the commenter to CMS for their program requirements.\n\n\n",

One commenter expressed concerns about the Clinical Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults/Report data element, stressing that human interpretation is needed and that it could be\ndangerous to send test results without “normal” or “abnormal” indicators, or a reference range.\n\nOne commenter sought clarification regarding whether ONC will require support for both\nstructured and unstructured narrative findings. One commenter noted that the availability of\nclinical tests in EHR systems varies substantially.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments regarding concerns about how the Clinical Tests\ndata elements are implemented. The two data elements represent the minimum information\nnecessary to convey patient data for non-laboratory and non-diagnostic imaging tests, such as\nelectrocardiograms and visual acuity. We agree with the commenter that supplemental data such\nas “normal,” “abnormal,” or reference ranges provide valuable information.

Health IT developers are encouraged to work with\ntheir customers to exchange data that adds value. The Clinical Test data element must be\nrepresented with a LOINC® code to indicate the specific test performed or planned. The Clinical\nTest Result/Report data element may be structured and represented using a code set such as\nSNOMED CT U.S. Edition, or unstructured and represented with free text.

We understand that many specialty\nhealth IT systems do not integrate with or support imaging services.

Several commenters stated that the data elements needed more\nstandardization before they should be required, and that it was unreasonable to include this data\nclass because there are no related standards yet. One commenter stated that the Health Insurance\nInformation data class is problematic because there is no guidance about how to align this\nproposed standard with the proposed US Core IG v5.0.1 that payers would be required to adopt\nvia the Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule (87 FR 76238). The commenter\nstated that ONC’s proposal does not align with the changes proposed in the Interoperability and\nPrior Authorization Proposed Rule. Commenters also stated that prior authorization standards\nwere needed for payers to see value in this data class. Additionally, commenters expressed\nconcern that most health IT systems seeking certification would need to rely on third-party\nsystems to support documentation and storage of health insurance data. Commenters also stated\nthat ONC should not add data elements to the USCDI that duplicate processes housed in practice\nmanagement systems. Several commenters stated that USCDI v3 should not be required until the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance Information data class is revised, or that USCDI v3 should be adopted without\nthe Health Insurance Information data class included. Commenters also stated that the Health\nInsurance Information data class should not have to be shared until CMS clarifies which data\nelements do not have to be shared through the Payer-to-Payer API to avoid the exchange of\ncompetitively sensitive information.\n\n*Response.* We have considered the comments expressing concern about the Health\nInsurance Information data class. We do not agree that there are no related standards for these\ndata elements, as HL7 FHIR US Core and the C-CDA Companion Guide support the Health\nInsurance Information data elements and include references to standard vocabulary where\navailable and in use. Regarding alignment with requirements proposed by CMS in the\nInteroperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule, we refer readers to CMS’ proposals in\nthe Interoperability and Prior Authorization Proposed Rule to allow payers to use updated\nversions of standards in § 170.215, subject to certain conditions including approval for use by the\nNational Coordinator (87 FR 76315). We also note that in the Interoperability and Prior\nAuthorization Proposed Rule, CMS has proposed to allow flexibility for use of a version of the\nUSCDI standard in § 170.213 (87 FR 76250) where proposed payer API requirements reference\nthe USCDI, which will include USCDI v3 under our finalized policy. We further disagree with\nthe concerns reflected in the comments about the burden that would be associated with sharing\nthis data and believe these comments may not accurately reflect what is expected from the\nUSCDI v3 data elements. The data elements in this data class are to exchange information about\nwhether a patient has insurance coverage, and the type of coverage. Also included are elements\nthat provide information about the plan. The Health Insurance Information data elements do not\ninclude any claims specific information. Additionally, we recognize that this information may or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmay not originate in an EHR, however Health IT Modules certified to certification criteria that\nreference § 170.213 must be able to capture and exchange the values when available.\n\nRegarding the comment about this data only being valuable with respect to prior\nauthorization standards, we note that such standards may be adopted in the future and believe\nthat this information can provide substantial value at present by supporting the availability of\ndata about coverage that is important for health care providers to understand a patient’s situation.\n\nWe recently sought comment through an RFI titled “Electronic Prior Authorization Standards,\nImplementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria” (87 FR 3475), which appeared in the\nJanuary 24, 2022 issue of the Federal Register, on how updates to the Program could support\nelectronic prior authorization. We have reviewed comments, and this information may be used to\ninform a future rulemaking related to the ONC Health IT Certification Program and electronic\nprior authorization. We will continue to work with CMS to ensure alignment with our rules.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters also expressed privacy concerns regarding the Health\nInsurance Information data class. Commenters suggested that ONC revise the data class to\nprotect patient privacy and that ONC should remove data elements that provide personally\nidentifiable information not supportive of patient care, such as “group identifier.” Commenters\nalso expressed concern about the inclusion of financial data in the USCDI, the sharing of claim-\nlevel payment information and the disclosure of confidentially negotiated rates.\n\n*Response.* As we have noted in similarly themed comments, the adoption of USCDI v3\nsets a new baseline for the capability of Health IT Modules certified to particular certification\ncriteria to capture and exchange data but does not dictate when and how either of those two\nactions occur. Further, the concerns expressed related to financial data including claim-level\n\n\n\n\n\n\npayment and negotiated rates are not within scope of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule because USCDI\nv3 does not include any financial, claim level, or negotiated rate data elements.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested that the data class should focus on data elements\nrelated to whether a person has insurance coverage, the type of coverage, and which payers are\ncovering the patient. Other commenters suggested that the data class should be revised to focus\non sharing information that can be collected based on national standards. Commenters also stated\nthat vendors use different health insurance payer identification numbers, making it challenging to\nmatch records, and that ONC should work with the industry to adopt a single source for payer\nidentification. One commenter recommended including both medical insurance and prescription\ninsurance as part of the data elements, and another comment recommended that ONC adopt the\ndata elements included in the CARIN IG for Blue Button.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the additional suggestions. The data elements in the Health\nInsurance Information class are to exchange information about whether a patient has insurance\ncoverage, and the type of coverage. Also included are elements that provide information about\nthe plan.\n\nThe USCDI v3 is a published standard at www.healthit.gov/uscdi and thus it is not\npossible to add new data elements to USCDI v3 through the rulemaking process or other means\nat this time. We direct commenters to the USCDI website available at www.healthit.gov/uscdi\nwhere the public is invited to enter comments on leveled data elements or submit new data\nelements for consideration in future versions of USCDI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters sought clarification regarding the Coverage Status data element\nand if it should indicate whether and which type of health insurance a patient has, rather than if\nspecific services are covered. One commenter sought clarification for why the value set for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoverage Type data element was not a required standard in USCDI v3. Commenters also sought\nclarification regarding whether health insurance includes both medical and prescription\ninsurance.\n\n*Response.* The Health Insurance data class is intended to capture data related to an\nindividual’s insurance coverage for healthcare including medical and prescription insurance.\n\nCoverage Status is defined in USCDI v3 as the presence or absence of healthcare insurance,\nwhereas Coverage Type is designed to communicate the category of healthcare payer (e.g.,\nMedicare, Commercial, Managed Care - PPO). ONC refers implementers to the US Core and C-\nCDA implementation guides for guidance on specific value sets. For future versions of USCDI,\nwe encourage interested parties to provide feedback for applicable vocabulary standards, for the\nCoverage Type and Coverage Status data elements during an open comment period at\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/uscdi.\n\n\n",

Generally, approved SVAP\nversions of standards are announced in June each year and become effective for Program use\nafter a 60-day period.<sup>44</sup>\nComments. The majority of the comments on the Health Status Assessment data class\nwere related to the Pregnancy Status data element. One commenter expressed support for\nincluding Pregnancy Status as a data element, but most comments expressed concerns about\nPregnancy Status, including regarding legal implications for providers and that sharing this\ninformation in patients’ records without their express consent could create real dangers. Some\ncommenters recommended reconsidering this data element given the increased criminalization of\nreproductive health and pregnancy-related care. Commenters suggested delaying the inclusion of\nthis data element until patient requested restrictions could be fully operationalized. Commenters\nalso noted a lack of standards around this data element and stated that without standards,\nincompatible data could be entered for Pregnancy Status, and recommended against including it\n\n\nFootnote 44:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/2023_SVAP_Fact_Sheet.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas a data element until there is a defined standard. One commenter recommended also including\nPregnancy Intention Screening as a data element.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments regarding privacy concerns expressed above. The\nadoption of USCDI v3 sets a new baseline for the capability of Health IT Modules certified to\nparticular certification criteria to capture and exchange data but does not dictate when and how\neither of those two actions occur. For more on patient requested restrictions on sharing of their\nhealth information, we refer readers to section III.C.10 on modifications to the “view, download,\nand transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1), stating patients (and their\nauthorized representatives) must be able to use an internet-based method to request a restriction\nto be applied for any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213.\n\nThe USCDI v3 is a published standard at www.healthit.gov/uscdi and thus it is not\npossible to add new data elements to USCDI v3 through the rulemaking process or other means\nat this time. We direct commenters to the USCDI website available at www.healthit.gov/uscdi\nwhere the public is invited to enter comments on leveled data elements or submit new data\nelements for consideration in future versions of USCDI. Commenters are directed to the FHIR\nUS Core 6.1.0 and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 for guidance on how to implement the\nPregnancy Status data element.\n\n\n",

This class adds four new data elements: Disability Status, Mental/Cognitive Status, Functional Status, and Pregnancy Status. Additionally, it reclassifies two existing elements, Health Concerns and Smoking Status, into this new category. The ONC recognizes that assessments can vary by provider but emphasizes that standardized vocabularies like LOINC and SNOMED CT will help identify and understand these assessments. While USCDI v4 introduces elements for Alcohol Use and Substance Use assessments, it is not adopted in this rule and is not yet available for use. Concerns about the Pregnancy Status element were raised, particularly regarding privacy and legal implications. The ONC clarifies that while USCDI v3 sets a baseline for data capture and exchange, it does not mandate when or how data is shared. Patients have the right to request restrictions on their health information sharing. The USCDI v3 standard is fixed and cannot be altered through rulemaking at this time, but the public can comment on or suggest new data elements for future versions at the USCDI website.",

                      "text": "Based on submissions and comments during the USCDI update processes described\nabove, we changed or added data elements in the Patient Demographics/Information data class.\n\nUSCDI v3 includes data elements Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, which have been\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadded to the USCDI Patient Demographics/Information data class. As described in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, we previously adopted standards for Sexual Orientation in the demographics\ncriterion in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) and for Gender Identity in the demographics criterion in §\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(E) that included requirements to code Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\naccording to the adopted SNOMED CT® U.S. Edition codes and HL7 Version 3 Standard,\nValue Sets for AdministrativeGender and NullFlavor, as referenced § 170.207(o)(1) and\n§ 170.207(o)(2), respectively (88 FR 23766). We proposed to remove the requirement to use\nspecific codes for representing Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and have removed the\ncodes as applicable vocabulary standards from USCDI v3. We proposed that certified health IT\nwith Health IT Modules certified to particular certification criteria that reference § 170.213\nwould be required to be capable of representing Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in\nSNOMED CT® U.S. Edition when such information is exchanged as part of USCDI. We stated\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we believe it is best to let the health IT community develop the\nlist of appropriate values for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, whether through\nimplementation specifications or developing additional codes in SNOMED CT® U.S. Edition\n(88 FR 23766).\n\nAs described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we have recharacterized the USCDI data\nelement Sex (Assigned at Birth) to Sex (88 FR 23766). We proposed to remove the requirement\nin § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C) and § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) to code Sex according to the adopted\nvalue sets of HL7 Version 3 Value Sets for AdministrativeGender and NullFlavor as referenced\nin the value sets in § 170.207(n)(1). We proposed instead to permit coding according to either the\nadopted value sets of HL7 Version 3 Value Sets for AdministrativeGender and NullFlavor as\nreferenced in the value sets in § 170.207(n)(1) until December 31, 2025, or in accordance with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe standard in proposed § 170.207(n)(2). We also proposed to no longer require the use of\nspecific code sets for representing Sex and have removed the codes from USCDI v3. We\nproposed that certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to certification criteria that\nreference § 170.213 would be required to be capable of representing Sex in SNOMED CT when\nsuch information is exchanged as part of USCDI. We proposed to adopt the same changes for\nrelevant certification criteria that reference these standards (see sections III.C.8 and III.C.9).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we noted efforts to develop a clinically meaningful way for\nidentifying a patient’s sex from observable information that may be suitable for clinical care,\nincluding the development of a new data element Sex for Clinical Use, and sought public\ncomment on this concept and approach (88 FR 23766). In addition, as noted in our proposals to\nthe “patient demographics and observations” certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(5), we\nproposed to adopt the same changes for relevant certification criteria that reference these\nstandards (see sections III.C.8 and III.C.9).\n\nAs discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, a new standard for patient addresses, the\nUnified Specification for Address in Health Care (US@),<sup>45</sup>\nemerged and was released in 2022\n(88 FR 23767). After receiving broad support from the public, ONC has incorporated the Project\nUS@ Technical Specification version 1 as the applicable standard for Current Address and\nPrevious Address in USCDI v3.\n\nAlso as discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, USCDI v3 includes six data elements\nadded to the USCDI Patient Demographics/Information data class: Related Person’s Name,\n\n\nFootnote 45:\nhttps://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=180486153.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Person’s Relationship, Date of Death, Occupation, Occupation Industry, and Tribal\nAffiliation.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters explicitly expressed support for the Patient\nDemographics/Information data class, noting that this will improve healthcare quality, enhance\ncommunication, bolster cultural competency, and support the ability of providers to gather and\nexchange the information needed to make the best care plans for their patients.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of the Patient\nDemographics/Information data class and for noting the potential benefits.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters had concerns about the Patient Demographics/Information\ndata class, including that it was not reasonable to require the full data class. Additionally,\ncomments included recommendations for ONC with respect to the Patient\nDemographics/Information data class. Comments recommended aligning deadlines with the\navailability of FHIR-based APIs to ensure consistency across interested parties and aligning the\nUSCDI Patient Demographics/Information data class with CMS definitions of the included data\nelements.\n\n*Response.* We receive submissions and comments from federal partners, including CMS,\non the USCDI and will continue to work towards alignment where appropriate with these\npartners. With respect to the suggestions regarding flexibility in supporting USCDI v3 data\nclasses and data elements for purposes of the Program, we decline to allow developers to be\nselective in which USCDI v3 data classes and data elements they support for purposes of the\nProgram. Because the USCDI standard is intended to provide a common set of data classes and\ndata elements in support of nationwide health information exchange, partial adoption of the\nUSCDI standard would impact the effectiveness of the standard and impede interoperability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Specific comments about data elements stated that standards should be\nincluded to restrict date formats for Date of Birth and Date of Death data elements, and that\nPrevious Name and Tribal Affiliation data elements should not be included in USCDI v3 until\nthere are standards for them. One commenter asked for clarification on whether detailed race\nstandards or free text fields should be used for Tribal Affiliation.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback on the lack of standards for the Date of\nBirth and Date of Death data elements. We direct commenters to the HL7 FHIR US Core\nImplementation Guide and the C-CDA Companion Guide when an applicable standard is not\nidentified in USCDI. In addition, these implementation guides provide guidance for exchanging\nPrevious Name and Tribal Affiliation, the latter of which includes a vocabulary binding to a\nharmonized value set.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters addressed the Sexual Orientation and Gender\nIdentity (SOGI) and Sex data elements. Many of those commenters expressed support for\nincluding SOGI data elements, for removal of the requirement to use specific codes for\nrepresenting SOGI, and for updating SOGI codes with SNOMED CT. Some of these\ncommenters noted that this would reduce burden and would facilitate identifying disparities and\nimproving outcomes for the LGBTQ+ population.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback in support of the Sexual Orientation,\nGender Identity, and Sex data elements and related requirements and standards, and for\nrecognizing the potential benefits.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns related to the SOGI data elements,\nincluding that best practices around SOGI data are not well established and that there could be\nunintended confusion around the terms. Commenters also stressed the need for standardized\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncodes related to SOGI, the importance of industry collaboration, and the value of education on\nSOGI data elements and use cases. One commenter noted that patients are historically reluctant\nto answer questions on sexual identity and this may lead to lower accuracy. One commenter\nstated that the health IT industry will not coalesce around value sets for Sex, Sexual Orientation\nand Gender Identity data elements and urged ONC to create them. Commenters also noted that\nseveral existing definitions within the proposed standards for SOGI expire on December 31,\n2025, and recommended aligning deadlines.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the detailed comments. We defined SNOMED CT, U.S. Edition\nas the vocabulary standard for Sex, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity in USCDI v3. We\ncollaborated with HL7, and the HL7 Gender Harmony Project team to update the US Core\nImplementation Guide and C-CDA Companion Guide with references to value sets with specific\nSNOMED CT U.S. Edition concepts. We work closely with federal partners to promote quality\ndata capture and storage practices using standard terminology. We encourage providers to work\nwith their patients to understand how and when this data is valuable for patient care and to\naddress the situation where a patient may be reluctant to share information.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that changing Sex (assigned at birth) to Sex would\nlead to inconsistency and that it would be preferable to define a series of specific data elements\nwith clear definitions related to this data class. One commenter sought clarification that under\nUSCDI v3 developers should continue exchanging the same data from their systems that is\ncurrently being exchanged as the Sex (assigned at birth) data element to comply with\nrequirements for the Sex data element.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the input regarding the Sex data element in USCDI\nv3 and concerns regarding the update from Sex (Assigned at Birth) in USCDI v2 to Sex in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSCDI v3. We, along with the HL7 community recognized that Sex (Assigned at Birth) has\nbeen used to represent different concepts not always associated with the value assigned at time of\nbirth such as clinically relevant sex for laboratory tests or diagnostic imaging, and administrative\nsex recorded on birth certificates and health forms. The values used for each instance may not be\nthe same for a given patient. Furthermore, the value set referenced in earlier versions of USCDI\nfor Sex (Assigned at Birth) does not include all possible values that represent sex. We therefore\nremoved the reference to the limited value set previously used and expanded the applicable\nvocabulary standard to the SNOMED CT U.S. Edition code set. ONC worked closely with HL7\nStructured Documents and US Core teams to update the US Core Implementation Guide and the\nC-CDA Companion Guide to distinguish between Sex (Assigned at Birth) and Sex as separate\ndata elements. It is ONC’s intent that developers continue exchanging the same data from their\nsystems that is currently being exchanged as Sex (Assigned at Birth) and additionally exchange\nthe USCDI v3 Sex data element.\n\n*Comments.* In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we stated that we welcomed public comment on\nthe development and inclusion in future standards of a new data element Sex for Clinical Use (88\nFR 23766). We received several comments in support of including a Sex for Clinical Use data\nelement in future versions of USCDI, generally because of the perceived benefits. One\ncommenter opposed inclusion of Sex for Clinical Use as a data element in USCDI without\nfurther consultation with transgender and intersex communities. However, most of the comments\nabout Sex for Clinical Use related to proposals regarding the Sex for Clinical Use data element in\nthe “patient demographics and observations” criterion.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these suggestions. Sex for Clinical Use may be\nconsidered for inclusion as a data element in a future version of USCDI. We received comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelated to Sex for Clinical Use as it relates to the “patient demographics and observations”\ncertification criterion, and we discuss those comments in section III.C.8 of this final rule\nconcerning the “patient demographics and observations” certification criterion in §\n170.315(a)(5).\n\n*Comments.* There were several comments related to the Race and Ethnicity data elements.\n\nCommenters expressed concerns about upgrading to the 2022 version of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) Race and Ethnicity code sets because this would add burden to\nthe industry and recommended only adding codes and not changing existing ones. Commenters\nrequested clarification on why this change was needed and the benefits. Commenters also noted\nthat ONC should follow efforts by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding\nadoption of new race and ethnicity data standards.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the input regarding the Race and Ethnicity data\nelements. We did not propose updating to the 2022 version of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) Race and Ethnicity code set at this time as the 2022 version of CDC Race\nand Ethnicity code set has not been released. We assure commenters that we follow efforts by\nOMB regarding adoption of new race and ethnicity standards.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters asked for additional guidance, including on how data for\nthe Patient Demographics/Information data class is collected and used, and on terminology\nrelated to SOGI. One commenter requested that ONC clarify how interested parties should\naddress conflicting information among SOGI data elements due to disparities in elements and\ncollection. One comment stated that ONC should encourage healthcare organizations to offer the\nterm “nonbinary” as a Gender Identity data element field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback. We do not dictate when and how\ncapture and exchange of USCDI data elements occur, nor how conflicting information may be\nreconciled. We also do not require specific concepts, such as “nonbinary,” from the applicable\nvocabulary standard, SNOMED CT U.S. Edition for Gender Identity, and instead defer to the\nHL7 FHIR US Core Implementation Guide, HL7 v2 and C-CDA Companion Guide to declare\nvalue sets appropriate for use.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We proposed to adopt the HL7® CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: C-CDA Templates\nfor Clinical Notes STU Companion Guide, Release 3 – US Realm in § 170.205(a)(6) (‘‘C-CDA\nCompanion Guide R3’’). The C-CDA Companion Guide R3 provides supplemental guidance\nand additional technical clarification for specifying data in the C-CDA Release 2.1 for USCDI\nv2. We stated that if the C-CDA Companion Guide Release 4 (C-CDA Companion Guide R4) is\npublished before the date of publication of this final rule, it would be our intention to consider\nadopting the updated C-CDA Companion Guide R4 that provides guidance and clarifications for\nspecifying data in USCDI v3 in § 170.205(a)(6), since we proposed to adopt USCDI v3 as the\nbaseline (88 FR 23767).\n\nAs mentioned above, HL7® has been updating the C-CDA Companion Guide to\naccommodate the new data classes and data elements in each USCDI version. To allow\ndevelopers to voluntarily update to USCDI v2, ONC included the C-CDA Companion Guide R3\nin the SVAP Approved Standards List for 2022. ONC released the SVAP Approved Standards\nList for 2022 in June 2022. We stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we anticipated that the C-\nCDA Companion Guide R4 would support updates included in the proposed USCDI v3 and that\nthe adoption of the C-CDA Companion Guide R4 would align with our goal to increase the use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof consistently implemented standards among health IT developers and improve interoperability.\n\nWe proposed to adopt the C-CDA Companion Guide R3 as a standard in § 170.205(a)(6) and\nincorporate it by reference in § 170.299. We stated that if the C-CDA Companion Guide R4 is\navailable at the time of publication of this final rule, we would consider adopting the C-CDA\nCompanion Guide R4 in § 170.205(a)(6), which would support the updates included in proposed\nUSCDI v3 (88 FR 23767).\n\nConsistent with our proposals in sections III.A and III.C.11, we proposed to revise §\n170.205(a)(5) to add that the adoption of the standard in § 170.205(a)(5) expires on January 1,\n2025. Developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to particular\ncertification criteria that reference § 170.205(a)(5) would have to update those Health IT\n\n\nModules to § 170.205(a)(6) and provide them to customers by January 1, 2025. We clarified that\nunder this proposal, for the time period up to and including December 31, 2024, HL7 CDA® R2\nImplementation Guide: C-CDA Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Companion Guide, Release 2\nwould remain applicable as the minimum version required in the Program.\n\nFurther, we proposed that Health IT Modules certified to the particular certification\ncriteria below would need to update to the HL7 CDA® R2 IG: C-CDA Templates for Clinical\nNotes R2.1 Companion Guide, Release 3 in § 170.205(a)(6) by January 1, 2025:\n• ‘‘transitions of care’’ (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(A));\n• ‘‘clinical information reconciliation and incorporation’’ (§ 170.315(b)(2)(i), (ii), and\n(iv));\n• ‘‘care plan’’ (§ 170.315(b)(9)(ii));\n• ‘‘view, download, and transmit to 3rd party’’ (§ 170.315(e)(1)(i)(A) and (B));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• ‘‘consolidated CDA creation performance’’ (§ 170.315(g)(6)(i)); and\n• ‘‘application access—all data request’’ (§ 170.315(g)(9)(i)).\n\nFor the purposes of meeting that compliance date, we stated that we expected health IT\ndevelopers to update their certified health IT without new mandatory testing and notify their\nONC-ACB on the date at which they have reached compliance. Developers would also need to\nfactor these updates into their next real world testing plan (88 FR 23767 through 23768).\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the adoption of the HL7 CDA® R2\nIG: C–CDA Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Companion Guide, Release 3 as proposed in §\n170.205(a)(6). Many of the comments also noted support for the adoption of C–CDA\nCompanion Guide Release that aligns with USCDI v3 if published before the date of publication\nof this final rule. Comments supporting this proposal noted that incorporating newer versions of\nthe C-CDA standard will improve interoperability of clinical data.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for support of our proposals and for recognizing\npotential benefits expand interoperability for clinical information shared via structured clinical\nnotes. We also appreciate commenters who recommended adoption of the most recent version of\nC-CDA Companion Guide. After the publication of C-CDA Companion Guide R4, HL7 found\nerrors with how the guide implemented data elements in USCDI v3 and had to make updates to\nthe specification to align with USCDI v3 and ensure that USCDI v3 can be implemented in\ncertified Health IT Modules. We note that C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 has not added any\nsubstantial functionality or requirements beyond C-CDA Companion Guide R4. Therefore, we\ndo not believe adoption of C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 would contribute to a greater\nimplementation burden, and C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 is the only version of the C-CDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanion Guide that fully aligns with and supports the complete USCDI v3. Given the support\nof the commenters to adopt the most recent version of the C-CDA Companion Guide that aligns\nwith USCDI v3, we have finalized adoption of C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1, which was\npublished in June 2023, in § 170.205(a)(6).\n\nAdopting the C-CDA Companion Guide R4.1 is necessary for developers of certified\nhealth IT to have appropriate implementation guidance to meet the criteria adopted in this final\nrule that reference USCDI v3. Based on public comments on this and prior rulemakings, we\nbelieve that the health IT industry, healthcare standards developers, and health care providers\nexpect and support ONC making such determinations so that the adopted version of standards are\nthe most up-to-date available and are feasible for real world implementation (see, for example,\n85 FR 25677 and 25708).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern about the deadline for this proposal and\nrequested to extend the implementation deadline. Some suggested deadline extensions included\nto 24 months post-effective date of this final rule and December 31, 2025.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for expressing a desire for an extension on proposed\ndeadlines. We have finalized a January 1, 2026 date for the expiration of the standard in §\n170.205(a)(5). We believe that this deadline provides adequate time for developers and industry\nto support C–CDA Companion Guide R4.1, which we have finalized in § 170.205(a)(6).\n\n*Comments.* A minority of commenters cautioned us about the real-world needs of\nphysicians and patients and added complexities of implementing additional health IT standards.\n\nOne commenter appreciated the flexibility and reduced burden of confirming conformance via a\nnotification to their ONC-ACB and noted concern that certification to a new requirement may\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninvolve proof of conformance to ensure that there is clear and consistent understanding and\napplication of requirements across developers of certified health IT.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the comments regarding the potential burden placed\non providers and developers by our proposal. We do not believe that the burden on providers or\ndevelopers for the adoption of a new version of the C-CDA Companion Guide is excessive. ONC\nhas worked closely with the implementer community to help alleviate burden, and we are\nconfident that the addition of USCDI v3 data elements will provide significant benefit.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We established a policy in the 2015 Edition Final Rule for minimum standards code sets\nthat update frequently (80 FR 62612). In prior rulemaking, we discussed the benefits of adopting\nnewer versions of minimum standards code sets, including the improved interoperability and\nimplementation of health IT with minimal additional burden (77 FR 54170). When determining\nwhether to propose newer versions of minimum standards code sets, we consider the impact on\ninteroperability and whether a newer version would require substantive effort for developers of\ncertified health IT to implement. If adopted, newer versions of minimum standards code sets\nwould serve as the baseline for certification and developers of certified health IT would be able\nto use newer versions of these adopted standards on a voluntary basis. We reiterate that while\nminimum standard code sets update frequently, perhaps several times in a single year, these\nupdates are confined to concepts within the code system, not substantive changes to the\nstandards themselves. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to adopt the following versions\nof the minimum standards code sets listed below (88 FR 23768 through 23769).\n\n• § 170.207(a) – Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed to remove and reserve § 170.207(a)(3), IHTSDO SNOMED CT®\nInternational Release July 2012 and US Extension to SNOMED CT® March 2012 Release. We\nproposed to revise § 170.207(a)(1), which is currently reserved, to reference SNOMED CT US\nEdition March 2022 and incorporate it by reference in § 170.299.\n\n• § 170.207(c) – Laboratory tests\nWe proposed to remove and reserve § 170.207(c)(2), Logical Observation Identifiers\nNames and Codes (LOINC®) Database version 2.40. We proposed to revise § 170.207(c)(1),\nwhich is currently reserved, to reference LOINC Database version 2.72, February 16, 2022, and\nincorporate it by reference in § 170.299.\n\n• § 170.207(d) – Medications\nWe proposed to revise § 170.207(d)(1), which is currently reserved, to reference RxNorm\nJuly 5, 2022, Full Monthly Release and incorporate it by reference in § 170.299. We proposed in\n§ 170.207(d)(4) to reference the code set specified in 45 CFR 162.1002(c)(1) which includes\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM);\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS)\n(including The Official ICD-10-PCS Guidelines for Coding and Reporting); National Drug\nCodes (NDC); the combination of Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure\nCoding System (HCPCS), as maintained and distributed by HHS, and Current Procedural\nTerminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4), as maintained and distributed by the American Medical\nAssociation, for physician services and other healthcare services; Health Care Financing\nAdministration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) as maintained and distributed by\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHHS, for all other substances, equipment, supplies, or other items used in healthcare services;\nand Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature.\n\nWe have not finalized this proposal and explain the update later in this section in\nresponse to a comment in support of our proposal to update the standards for Medications in §\n170.207(d).\n\n• § 170.207(e) – Immunizations\nWe proposed to revise § 170.207(e)(1), which is currently reserved, to reference CVX –\nVaccinesAdministered, updates through June 15, 2022, and incorporate it by reference in §\n170.299.

We also proposed to revise §\n170.207(p)(6) to include a reference to the version of the Unified Code of Units of Measure in\nproposed § 170.207(m)(2).\n\n• § 170.207(r) – Provider type\nWe proposed to revise § 170.207(r)(2), which is currently reserved, to reference\nMedicare Provider and Supplier Taxonomy Crosswalk, October 29, 2021, and incorporate it by\nreference in § 170.299.\n\n• § 170.207(s) – Patient insurance\nWe proposed to revise § 170.207(s)(2), which is currently reserved, to reference Public\nHealth Data Standards Consortium Source of Payment Typology Code Set December 2020\nVersion 9.2 and incorporate it by reference in § 170.299.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to updating the minimum standards code sets listed above, we proposed to\nupdate some of the certification criteria that reference those minimum standards. We proposed to\nupdate some of the certification criteria that reference § 170.207(a) Problems by replacing the\nreference to § 170.207(a)(4) in those criteria that reference it with a reference to the new\nproposed § 170.207(a)(1). These criteria include § 170.315(a)(12), (b)(1)(iii)(B)(2),\n(b)(6)(ii)(B)(2), (c)(4)(iii)(I), and (f)(4)(ii). We also proposed to update § 170.315(f)(3)(ii) by\nreplacing the reference to § 170.207(a)(3) with a reference to the new proposed § 170.207(a)(1).\n\nWe proposed to update the certification criteria that reference § 170.207(c) Laboratory\nTests by replacing the references to § 170.207(c)(2) and (c)(3) in those criteria with a reference\nto the new proposed § 170.207(c)(1). These criteria include § 170.315(f)(3)(ii) and (f)(4)(ii).\n\nWe proposed to update two certification criteria that reference § 170.207(e)\nImmunizations. We proposed to update the certification criterion § 170.315(f)(1)(i)(B), which\nreferences § 170.207(e)(3), to instead reference the new proposed § 170.207(e)(1). We also\nproposed to update the certification criterion § 170.315(f)(1)(i)(C), which references §\n170.207(e)(4), by replacing the reference to § 170.207(e)(4) in that criterion with a reference to\nthe new proposed § 170.207(e)(2).\n\nWe proposed to update several certification criteria that reference § 170.207(f) Race and\nEthnicity. We proposed to update certification criteria that reference § 170.207(f)(2) to instead\nreference the new proposed § 170.207(f)(3). These criteria include § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(A)(1) and\n(2) and § 170.315(c)(4)(iii)(H).\n\nAs described in sections III.C.1 and III.C.8 of this final rule, we proposed to update\ncriteria that reference § 170.207(n) Sex by updating criteria that reference § 170.207(n)(1) to\nreference the new proposed § 170.207(n)(2). More specifically, we proposed to update §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(C) to reference § 170.207(n)(1) for the time period up to and including\nDecember 31, 2025, or to reference § 170.207(n)(2). We also proposed to update §\n170.315(c)(4)(iii)(G) and § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) to reference § 170.207(n)(2). We note that,\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule regulation text in § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3), we inadvertently\nincluded a reference to § 170.213 (88 FR 23909) instead of including § 170.207(n)(2) as\ndiscussed in our proposal (88 FR 23821). ONC has finalized § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) without\nthe proposed reference to § 170.213. We have finalized § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) to include a\nreference to § 170.207(n)(2) to correct this error and to reference the most recent version of\nSNOMED CT U.S. Edition available at the time of this rule. Health IT developers may update to\na newer version if one exists at effective date of the criterion.\n\nAdditionally, as described in sections III.C.1 and III.C.8 of this final rule, we proposed\nto update the criteria that reference § 170.207(o) Sexual orientation and gender information (as\nwe proposed to rename the criterion) by updating criteria that reference § 170.207(o)(1) and (2).\n\nWe proposed to replace the reference to § 170.207(o)(1) in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) with a\nreference to the new proposed § 170.207(o)(3) and proposed to replace the reference to §\n170.207(o)(2) in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(E) with a reference to the new proposed § 170.207(o)(3).\n\nMore specifically, we proposed to update § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) to reference § 170.207(o)(1) for\nthe time period up to and including December 31, 2025, or to reference § 170.207(o)(3), as well\nas whether a patient declines to specify sexual orientation. We proposed to update §\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(E) to reference § 170.207(o)(2) for the time period up to and including\nDecember 31, 2025, or to reference § 170.207(o)(3), as well as whether a patient declines to\nspecify gender identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also proposed to update § 170.315(c)(4)(iii)(C), which references § 170.207(r)\nProvider Type. Specifically, we proposed to replace the reference to § 170.207(r)(1) in that\ncriterion with a reference to the new proposed § 170.207(r)(2). We also proposed to update §\n170.315(c)(4)(iii)(E), which references § 170.207(s) Patient insurance. Specifically, we proposed\nto replace the reference to § 170.207(s)(1) in that criterion with a reference to the new proposed\n§ 170.207(s)(2).\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters were supportive of ONC’s proposal to adopt updated\nminimum code set versions. Meanwhile other commenters had recommendations pertinent to\nspecific standards considered a “minimum standard” code set.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of our proposal to adopt updated minimum\ncode set versions. We have finalized the adoption of updated minimum standard code set\nversions as proposed. We note that newer versions of the codes sets may have become available\nsince we published the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and this does not preclude developers of certified\nhealth IT from updating minimum code sets to newer versions in their Health IT Modules.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested different naming conventions for different\nstandards and data concepts included as part of the Program’s minimum standard code sets,\nincluding the name of Patient Demographics, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. However, we have finalized the title of §\n170.207(o) to reflect the inclusion of the minimum standard code set for Pronouns in that\nsection, and we have finalized our proposal to update the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\ntitle in § 170.207(o) to “Sexual orientation and gender information” to provide clarity on the\nstandard code sets related to data elements in that section. We have also finalized our proposal to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate the “demographics” title in § 170.315(a)(5) to “patient demographics and observations”\nto acknowledge that not all data described in that section are understood to be demographics.\n\n*Comments.* We received multiple comments encouraging ONC to continue to work with\nthe HL7 Gender Harmony project team and federal partners to update terminology definitions\nover time.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of our working with the HL7 Gender\nHarmony project team and federal partners to update terminology definitions. We anticipate\nongoing collaboration with these parties to promote collection and exchange of data elements\nrelated to health equity and support for underserved populations.\n\n*Comments.* We received a comment in support of the proposal to update the standards for\nMedications at § 170.207(d); however, the commenter noted that the reference to 45 CFR\n162.1002(c)(1) for NDC includes references to medical code sets that are not appropriate for\nmedications and the reference should be changed to 162.1002(b)(2), which is specific to NDC.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their support of our proposed updates. We note\nthat our reference to 45 CFR 162.1002(c)(1) in the proposal was intended to be consistent with\nthe timeframes identified in the referenced regulation – i.e. “For the period on and after October\n1, 2015” as opposed to 45 CFR 162.1002(b)(2) which is referenced as “For the period on and\nafter October 16, 2003 through September 30, 2015.” However, we agree with the commenter\nthat the reference should include only NDC, and we have finalized § 170.207(d)(4) to reference\n45 CFR 162.1002(b)(2) as referenced in 45 CFR 162.1002(c)(1) for the period on and after\nOctober 1, 2015.” We did not intend to cross-reference code sets no longer in effect, and we\nbelieve that commenters would have anticipated us to correct this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments related to the OMB Initial Proposals For\nUpdating OMB's Race and Ethnicity Statistical Standards and the 2022 proposed updates to the\nCDC Race and Ethnicity code set. Some commenters suggest that ONC prioritize and prepare for\nany changes that may be necessary should the proposed changes be finalized. Other commenters\nexpressed concern that the proposed changes will have a significant impact on health IT. Some\ncommenters provided suggestions for ONC to develop data collection guidelines and provided\nsuggestions for code set content updates.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input regarding the proposed updates to the\nCDC race and ethnicity code set and OMB race and ethnicity collection; however, these\ncomments are out of scope for this rulemaking. We will continue to work with federal partners to\npromote alignment for these data concepts.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments regarding the effective dates for the new minimum\ncode set versions. Some comments suggested that ONC specify the time health IT developers\nmust incorporate the new code set versions once they have been published to allow time for\nhealth IT developers and providers to incorporate the new versions. Other commenters\nrecommended that ONC align code set version update timelines to the base program\nrequirements.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input regarding the effective dates for new\nminimum code set version and to align code set version updates timelines to the base Program\nrequirements. We have finalized the adoption of § 170.207 with a compliance date of January 1,\n2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have adopted the proposed version of code sets. Again, we note that we have adopted\nminimum code set versions and this does not preclude developers of certified health IT from\nupdating minimum code sets to newer versions in their Health IT Modules.\n\n\n",

              "text": "As discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, case reporting serves as early notification to\nPublic Health Agencies (PHAs) for potential disease outbreaks and includes information that\nenables PHAs to start contact tracing and other prevention measures. (88 FR 23769)\nSince ONC adopted 45 CFR 170.315(f)(5) as a functional requirement for Health IT\nModules in the 2015 Edition, standards development organizations (SDOs), public health, and\ninterested parties within the healthcare industry have balloted several standards related to\nelectronic case reporting. The standards were produced and developed through a collaborative\neffort among many partners, including CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists\n(CSTE), the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the Association of\nPublic Health Laboratories (APHL), EHR developers, and the HL7 Public Health (PH) Work\nGroup.<sup>46</sup>\nThese standards pertain to both HL7® FHIR and HL7® CDA and include multiple\nImplementation Guides (IGs).\n\nRecognizing advancement of standards development in this area, ONC analyzed the\ncurrently balloted standards for potential inclusion in the existing 45 CFR 170.315(f)(5)\ncriterion. As discussed in detail in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, ONC examined the standards for\npotential inclusion as a part of this criterion (88 FR 23770-23771).\n\n\nFootnote 46:\nSee work group membership at: https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/Public+Health+Work+Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23771-23772), we proposed to adopt standards for\nelectronic case reporting in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii). This included a proposal in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(A)\nthat a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(f)(5) support the consumption and processing of\nelectronic case report trigger codes and parameters based on a match from Reportable Conditions\nTrigger Code value set in § 170.205(t)(4) received from the eRSD profiles as specified in the\nHL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1). We clarified that a Health IT Module need only support\nparsing and consuming the eRSD Specification Library and eRSD Supplemental Library because\nwe understand that health IT developers may choose to either manually encode the electronic\ncase reporting trigger logic into Health IT Modules or may support a more automated process for\nencoding the trigger logic into Health IT Modules. We requested comment on this approach and\non whether there is general support of the eRSD Specification Library and eRSD Supplemental\nLibrary for electronic case reporting triggering (88 FR 23773).\n\nAdditionally, we proposed in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(B) to require a Health IT Module to\ncreate a case report for electronic transmission according to at least one of the following two\nHL7® standards: in accordance with the electronic initial case report (eICR) profiles specified in\nthe HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1) or in accordance with the HL7 CDA eICR IG in\n§ 170.205(t)(2). Finally, we proposed in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(C) to require that Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(f)(5) support the receipt, consumption, and processing of reportability\nresponses (RR) formatted according to the RR profiles defined in the HL7 FHIR eCR IG or the\nHL7 CDA RR IG.\n\n*Comments.* We received numerous comments and broad support for updating the\n“electronic case reporting” criterion to reference standards-based requirements. Commenters\nstated that the current functional certification criteria in the Program do not meet eCR program\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneeds and that requiring use of a standard would improve interoperability and implementation\nconsistency to further enable the transmission of timely, granular, and accurate case data\nbetween health providers and public health agencies. Commenters stated that moving from\nfunctional electronic case reporting requirements to standards-based requirements is an important\nstep toward ensuring that public health programs have access to critical data. Commenters also\nstated there is substantial opportunity to empower public health, improve public health\nsurveillance, and more efficiently monitor and manage public health concerns through\nstandardization of electronic case reporting. Others wrote that the standards would improve\nconsistency and increase real-time communication between healthcare and public health.\n\nSeveral commenters supported the requirements as proposed, including the requirements\nfor Health IT Modules to support either HL7 FHIR or HL7 CDA standards for case reporting.\n\nSome commenters stated the need for EHRs to support the HL7 CDA standard since many\npublic health agencies only accept HL7 CDA documents. Several commenters stated that both\nthe HL7 CDA and the HL7 FHIR standards should be required to allow Public Health Agencies\n(PHAs) time and the appropriate resources to be able to receive incoming electronic case reports.\n\nOther commenters stated they would prefer a single standard be included in the criterion rather\nthan including multiple options for certification. Commenters noted that existing health\ninformation conversion tools could help with the translation between HL7 CDA and HL7 FHIR\nformats. Additionally, commenters advocated that the electronic case report and the reportability\nresponse should adhere to the same standard (CDA or FHIR) and noted that it would be\nburdensome if the reportability response from public health was based on a different standard\nthan the initial case report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and agree with the importance of including\nstandards to improve interoperability and public health agencies’ access to critical information.\n\nTaking into consideration feedback from commenters, we have finalized our proposal in §\n170.315(f)(5)(ii)(B) to require Health IT Modules to enable a user to create a case report\nconsistent with at least the eICR profile of the HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1) or the HL7\nCDA eICR IG § 170.205(t)(2). Additionally, we have finalized in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(C) to\nrequire Health IT Modules to receive, consume, and process a case report response according to\nthe reportability response profile of the HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1) or the HL7 CDA\nRR IG in § 170.205(t)(3) as determined by the standard used in (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. We\nhave finalized this requirement to ensure that a Health IT Module that creates a case report\naccording to the eICR profile of HL7 FHIR eCR IG can receive, consume, and process a case\nreport response using the same HL7 FHIR eCR IG. The same would be true for a Health IT\nModule that creates a case report according to the HL7 CDA eICR IG; this Health IT Module\nmust be capable of receiving a reportability response according the HL7 CDA RR IG. We\nbelieve requiring support for creating a case report based on either the HL7 FHIR eCR IG or the\nHL7 CDA eICR IG while requiring support for receipt, consumption, and processing of a case\nreport response according to either the HL7 FHIR eCR IG or the HL7 CDA RR IG provides\ntechnical design flexibility while supporting the HL7 CDA-based landscape for case reporting\nthat exists today. Additionally, we have finalized our proposal in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(D) for\nHealth IT Modules to support transmission of a case report electronically to a system capable of\nreceiving a case report.\n\nAs with most consensus-based standards, we recognize that additional improvements can\nbe made to the HL7 FHIR and HL7 CDA IGs for case reporting. We encourage interested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparties, including the CDC, the appropriate HL7 working groups, and public health associations\nto update and improve the IGs, as well as collaborate on solutions that facilitate the ability of\nPHAs to parse, filter, and consume case reports. We plan to continue monitoring the\ndevelopment of standards for case reporting and foundational standards that facilitate\ninteroperability for various public health use cases. As the HL7 FHIR-based certification criteria\nin the Program continue to grow and industry more broadly supports HL7 FHIR-based IGs, we\nintend to transition to solely an HL7 FHIR-based approach for case reporting in future\nrulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that the adoption of HL7® standards was\nunnecessary to advance interoperability for EHI because EHR systems are capable of effectively\nand securely communicating using multiple standards and messaging formats. This commenter\nstated that the adoption of HL7 standards would prevent health care providers from using other\nstandards that could better serve different situations and communities.\n\n*Response.* We disagree that adoption of standards for case reporting is unnecessary to\nadvance interoperability. We note that for nearly a decade, Program requirements for electronic\ncase reporting have not been standards-based, and numerous examples cited in this preamble and\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule reveal deficiencies in nationwide electronic case reporting due to\nmisaligned technical standards and implementations. We believe that consensus has emerged for\nadoption of HL7 standards, which we have finalized in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii), and we believe that\nsuch standards can be enhanced over time to address the emergent needs of health care providers\nand the communities they serve.\n\n*Comments.* We received multiple comments supporting our proposal relating to the\nconsumption and processing of case report trigger codes based on the Reportable Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger Code value set in § 170.205(t)(4). Many public health agency commenters expressed\nsupport to require certified Health IT Modules to support the ability to consume and process the\neRSD profiles, which include the RCTC value set, regardless of whether such a Health IT\nModule supports a FHIR-based or CDA-based approach to certification, stating that it would\nsupport interoperability. One hospital-based commenter suggested that in addition to the\nmandated proposed RCTC value sets, ONC should require support for the adjunct ‘eRSD\nSupplemental Library’ as part of the certification criterion at § 170.315(f)(5) as we proposed.\n\nSeveral health IT developer commenters stated that the eRSD profiles should not be required,\nincluding the reference to the eRSD Supplemental Library or the eRSD Specification Library,\nstating that the underlying standards are too immature and not sufficient for broad use.\n\nCommenters further stated concerns about the burdensome and manual updates and maintenance\nrequired to support the eRSD profiles and noted that the specification is mainly in use today by\nthe eCR Now FHIR App, a solution developed specifically for case reporting. One commenter\nsuggested that Health IT Modules should be required to use updated reportable condition trigger\ncodes, stating that during an emergency, new trigger codes are almost always needed and are\nnecessary in effectiveness of use in an emergency response. One commenter emphasized\ncoordination with the CDC to not only make eRSD-based sharing of reportable events available,\nbut also the Reportable Conditions Knowledge Management System (RCKMS) to enable\nefficient sharing of PHA requirements in terms of reportable events, content, format, and\ntransport.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their perspectives. We agree that consuming and\nprocessing reportable condition trigger codes is a necessary first step in electronic case reporting,\nand we have finalized in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(A) our proposal that Health IT Modules certified to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(f)(5) must, beginning January 1, 2026, support the consumption and processing of\ncase reporting trigger codes and must identify a reportable patient visit or encounter based on a\nmatch from the RCTC value set in § 170.2015(t)(4). However, after additional examination of\nthe HL7 FHIR eCR specification, and in response to comments received, we have not adopted\nour proposal to require that such Health IT Modules receive the RCTC value set from the eRSD\nprofiles as specified in the HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1). This means that Health IT\nModules do not need to support the eRSD profiles, including the eRSD PlanDefinition,\nSupplemental Library, and Specification Library, in order to be certified to § 170.315(f)(5).\n\nWe have finalized this approach to allow developers of certified health IT flexibility to\nsupport the consumption of the RCTC value set in the way that best suits their technology and in\na way that does not constrain how the RCTC value set is consumed as the underlying standards\nmature. We share concerns with commenters who noted that the triggering logic within the\neRSD profiles of the FHIR IG are complex, not supported across the industry, and remain largely\nuntested outside their use in the eCR Now FHIR App. We believe requiring that a Health IT\nModule certified to § 170.315(f)(5) support the consumption and processing of case reporting\ntrigger codes and identify a reportable patient visit or encounter based on a match from the\nRCTC value set in § 170.205(t)(4), without further constraining how the RCTC value set is\nreceived, will simplify Program conformance and responds to concerns raised by commenters\nand raised through our own analysis.\n\nFor purposes of Program conformance, we reiterate from the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that\nthe RCTC value set in § 170.205(t)(4) is a minimum standard code set, and that Health IT\nModules certifying to § 170.315(f)(5) by way of § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) may voluntarily support an\nupdated version (e.g., a subsequent release) of the RCTC value set. We anticipate that health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers would be incentivized by their customers to take advantage of this opportunity to\nvoluntarily support updated versions of the RCTC value set because updated versions will likely\ninclude new codes reflecting new or emerging infectious diseases (88 FR 23773). We urge\ndevelopers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) to support all the reportable\ncondition trigger codes in the RCTC value set as it updates so that emerging infectious diseases\nmay be reported electronically to public health authorities as those infectious diseases emerge.\n\nWe note that the RCTC value set is not currently hosted on the National Library of\nMedicine Value Set Authority Center, like many other value sets. Instead, the RCTC value set is\ncurrently available for distribution by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.<sup>47</sup>\nWe plan\nto work with CDC and the industry to align the availability of the RCTC value set with other,\nsimilar value sets in the future.\n\nFinally, we note that the CDA IG cross-references the RCTC value set specified in the\nHL7 FHIR eCR IG.<sup>48</sup>\nTherefore, Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(5) using the HL7\nCDA IG as described in § 170.315(f)(5)(i), must also support the requirement to trigger a case\nreport based on a match from the RCTC value set in § 170.205(t)(4) at a minimum. We\nencourage implementers to reference the HL7 CDA eICR IG for additional guidance regarding\nthe use of the RCTC value set for identifying reportable cases.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested requiring a longer compliance date than December\n31, 2024, for health IT developers to certify to the proposed updated criterion to allow the\nindustry to widely implement the standards-based requirements in production. One commenter\n\n\nFootnote 47:\nElectronic Reporting and Surveillance Distribution page managed by the Association of Public Health\nLaboratories: https://ersd.aimsplatform.org/#/home\n\n\nFootnote 48:\nSee section 1.11.2 of the CDA eICR IG titled, “Using the eRSD (from the FHIR eCR IG).”\nhttps://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=436.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpressed support, stating that allowing current standards requirements to remain until December\n31, 2024, is reasonable, while another commenter recommended an implementation deadline of\nDecember 31, 2025. Several commenters stated that more time should be given for compliance,\nsuch as a minimum of 24 months post-final rule effective date for such deadlines or postponing\nthe requirement for electronic case reporting until public health jurisdictions can adequately\nadapt to the technology needed to ingest the data. One commenter expressed that more time is\nneeded to develop, test, and deliver new capabilities, stating that the proposed timeframe is\ninsufficient.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ concerns about the timelines for conformance to\nnew standards for the Program. We have finalized in § 170.315(f)(5) that Health IT Modules\nmust enable a user to create a case report for electronic transmission meeting requirements in §\n170.315(f)(5)(i) for the time period up to and including December 31, 2025, or meet the\nrequirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii). This approach will allow developers to continue to certify to\nfunctional requirements for case reporting according to § 170.315(f)(5)(i) while allowing\ndevelopers to certify to the standards-based approach to case reporting in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii).\n\nAfter December 31, 2025, developers will only be able to certify to case reporting using the\nstandards-based approach described § 170.315(f)(5)(ii). In addition, previously certified products\nwill need to update their certification to the standards-based approach described in §\n170.315(f)(5)(ii) by December 31, 2025. We believe this date will provide adequate time for\ndevelopers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(5) to comply\nwith the requirements we have finalized, while also ensuring timely implementation of the\nrequirements for public health agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters suggested that systems receiving electronic case reports\nshould also have to certify to capabilities that align with the requirements in § 170.315(f)(5).\n\nAnother commenter stated that there is little value in requiring the capability to transmit\nelectronic case reporting if public health partners do not have the capabilities to receive data\nelectronically. Some commenters stated that they are prepared to support electronic case\nreporting but have not been able to do so due to lack of public health capacity to receive it, and\nrecommended ONC work with other agencies to support public health partners with funding to\nbolster electronic case reporting capacity. Several commenters suggested ONC provide support\nfor the transition to eCR reporting, such as ONC collaborating with other agencies and public\nhealth entities to provide financial resources/incentives and support, as well as publishing and\nmaintaining a master list of U.S. public health data standards, and work with state and local\npublic health agencies to ensure technical readiness for their adoption and implementation. One\ncommenter recommended ONC encourage and enforce public health agencies to move away\nfrom manual reporting. The same commenter also urged coordination to promote the reduction\nand elimination of variances in format and transport mechanisms.\n\nOne commenter expressed support and requested clarification if the intent is to require\nsupport based on the standards ONC specifies, and not to require support for jurisdiction-specific\ncommunication methods. Another commenter stated that state and local variations create burden\non the sender to meet specific requests and needs of jurisdictions. One commenter requested\nfurther guidance through a companion guide on how to comply with differing federal and state\nregulations related to electronic case reporting requirements, such as what additional data\nelements are needed by state PHAs and beyond those that are defined in the standards. Multiple\ncommenters expressed concern regarding variability in implementation of standards, and the\n\n\n\n\n\n\njurisdictional distinctions that required customizations and manual burden to maintain. We\nreceived a few comments stating that the proposed requirements are too broad and urged a more\ntempered approach to permit maturation as integrations increase. One commenter stated that the\nproposal does not describe likely performance parameters or offer an architecture that would\nsupport true disease surveillance. Some commenters expressed concern with public health\nagencies’ lack of readiness for electronic case reporting, stating that, in their experience,\nproduction use of electronic case reporting is limited for conditions beyond COVID-19 and\nMpox.\n\n*Response.* We understand that gaps remain in practice regarding the ability of public\nhealth agencies to receive electronic case reports, particularly with parsing, filtering, and\nconsuming incoming electronic case reports, and that manual reporting mechanisms remain in\nplace for many reportable conditions. We appreciate the commenters that suggested we create an\naligned requirement for systems receiving electronic case reports and will consider these\ncomments for future rulemaking. We are supportive of CDC-led efforts to build public health\ncapacity to accept electronic case report information, and the electronic receipt and ingestion of\nelectronic case reports are a core component of the CDC Public Health Data Strategy.<sup>49</sup>\nWe\nbelieve the timeline for requiring standards-based electronic case reporting for Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(f)(5) will allow both healthcare organizations and public health\nagencies to develop and implement the capability for receipt and exchange of electronic case\nreports and associated information. We recognize the need for ONC to continue to collaborate\nand coordinate with CDC and national public health associations, as well as with public health\n\n\nFootnote 49:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ophdst/public-health-data-strategy/Public_Health_Data_Strategy-final-P.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\njurisdictions. Further, there are tools and intermediary options available, like HL7 CDA to HL7\nFHIR conversion tools, that PHAs could leverage to accept incoming HL7 FHIR-based case\nreports and convert them into a format they can receive and process.\n\nWe acknowledge that variations between state and federal requirements and local\nrequirements and needs add burden for reporters. However, we are unable to holistically solve\nthis challenge through the Program. The Program is voluntary, and developers that elect to\nparticipate are only required to adhere to the requirements in applicable certification criteria. The\nProgram does not directly address case reporting requirements imposed by state or local bodies.\n\nFurthermore, we believe these issues could be addressed through the standards development\nprocesses, including through the Public Health Workgroup for HL7, and through working with\nPHAs and appropriate public health associations to align on the use of a national standard and\nreduce state and local variation in requirements where possible. Regarding comments that the\nproposals are too broad, we believe requiring standards-based support for electronically reporting\ncase reports and receiving reportability responses, including using standard triggers, will allow\nfor implementation flexibility while improving interoperability. Further, standards-based\nrequirements can help to reduce variation and fragmentation that may otherwise cause\ninteroperability issues for implementers and users. We understand that PHAs expressed concerns\nrelated to technology used by PHAs being able to accept incoming reports that adhere to the\nFHIR standard. We believe that the longer timeline can help with this transition, as well as allow\nthe industry time to pursue different approaches to implementing the required components of the\neCR FHIR IG. We understand concerns related to performance, scalability, and maintenance,\nand will monitor standards development and implementation to inform future rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that public health-specific approaches for data\nexchange should not be the way of the future, and that existing solutions, such as FHIR\ncapabilities including subscriptions and patient-level queries, should instead be leveraged for the\npurposes of public health data exchange. Several commenters believe common data\ninfrastructure and standards, such as HL7 FHIR-based APIs and the SMART Backend Services,\nwould better serve electronic case reporting than the current standards, which they stated are\nbrittle and require consistent updating and manual support. Several commenters offered\nsuggestions of additional functionality. One commenter suggested that health IT developers must\nprovide functionality to users to send on-discharge summary updates for patients admitted to\nhospital, and interfaces to allow their users to adjust timing of triggering, document build, send,\nand other parameters. One commenter suggested that ONC incorporate the language and data\nelements of specialty records into its standards to increase effectiveness for interoperability\ninitiatives across the spectrum of patient care. Another commenter suggested requiring\nfunctionality related to high-risk and immediate reporting for provider-initiated (or ‘manually\ntriggered’) electronic reporting stating that provider-triggered ‘manual’ eCRs are critical for\nemergency preparedness and reducing the burden on healthcare staff and public health staff of\nmanual reporting and data entry in future outbreaks, novel conditions, and early in confirmed\noutbreak scenarios. One commenter stated that healthcare facility IDs and address formatting\ncause serious impacts for public health because they cannot be verified for eCRs sent. The\ncommenter, therefore, suggested more standards conformance and health IT functionality to\nallow users to easily edit, update, and maintain correct facility IDs, as well as consistent\nformatting of address and rational facility naming, will ease processing burden on PHAs and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nother data receivers. Several comments mentioned specific challenges within the proposed\nspecifications, including challenges with certain data elements.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge the importance of reusable and scalable standards for health\ninformation interoperability including standards-based APIs. The Standardized API for “patient\nand population services” criterion at § 170.315(g)(10) has provided a baseline for reusable\nservices to advance interoperability nationwide. Like many other HL7 FHIR IGs in the US\nRealm, the HL7 FHIR profiles defined in the eCR FHIR IG were built using the profiles defined\nin the US Core IG as part of the HL7 FHIR profiling model.<sup>50</sup>\nNotably, the US Core IG is part of\nthe certification criterion at § 170.315(g)(10), adopted in § 170.215(b)(1) and incorporated by\nreference in § 170.299. While we recognize the potential of these foundational APIs,\nimplementation guides, and services to generally support public health, we believe it is helpful to\nprovide further specificity for use cases like electronic case reporting. We will consider ways to\nalign the public health certification criteria in the Program to promote reuse of common\nstandards to support various public health reporting and interoperability use cases in future\nrulemaking. We appreciate that challenges and additional potential uses and applications of the\nelectronic case reporting standard remain. However, the Program is not the venue through which\nthe specification can be updated or changed. We encourage commenters to participate in\nstandards development processes, including in the HL7 Public Health Workgroup. Further, we\nare aware that tools exist for PHAs that can translate incoming FHIR to CDA and/or other\nformats that public health surveillance systems can currently accept, which can aid with data\n\n\nFootnote 50:\nhttps://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#reslicing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreceipt in the interim period as surveillance systems are updated to be able to receive FHIR and\nas additional FHIR-based tools and solutions are developed and implemented.\n\nFor concerns related to triggering and adjusting triggers based on timing and the\noccurrence of certain events, we believe this can be addressed through healthcare organizations\nand other reporters working with public health jurisdictions to determine the timing and triggers\nthat work for all involved participants and that do not place undue burden on health IT and\npublic health systems. We also encourage triggering and timing approaches to be discussed\nthrough standards development processes to develop, pilot, and share approaches that meet the\nneeds of both reporters and public health agencies.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on whether the Health IT Module\nbeing certified needs to identify any intermediaries involved in the transmission of electronic\ncase reports or RR messages as part of certification, or if these intermediaries need to also be\ncertified for these eCR criteria. Another commenter requested clarification on how a “system\ncapable of receiving an electronic case report” would be identified or validated, and whether this\nsystem would need to be certified against specific criteria. A few commenters recommended\nrecognition, or new certification processes using the eCR Now FHIR application with a\ncompanion guide, as well as a different set of data than the USCDI v1 data set cited as standard\nfor the criterion to ensure health IT systems can meet the new certification criteria. One\ncommenter suggested that the eCR Now FHIR App should be accepted for certification. Some\ncommenters expressed a belief that continued success in case reporting relies on a reasonable\nexpectation of a routing and decision support intermediary such as AIMS (APHL Informatics\nMessaging Services). One commenter suggested that the AIMS network should support the\nsubmission (and response to submission) of any public health reporting using RESTful (or\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentational State Transfer) application programming interfaces. One commenter\nrecommended that ONC work closely with the CDC and the AIMS Platform team to ensure\nrequirements do not exceed or violate the AIMS requirements, stating that many of the proposals\nare beyond the current allowed features on the AIMS network application programming\ninterfaces. One commenter recommended that ONC work closely with the CDC and the AIMS\nPlatform team to ensure requirements do not exceed or violate the AIMS requirements, stating\nthat many of the proposals are beyond the current allowed features on the AIMS network.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the questions we received related to intermediaries, the use of\nspecific tools or systems, and the applicability of the Program to intermediaries. Our Program is\nvoluntary, and health IT developer participation in the Program has traditionally been\nincentivized through connections to CMS payment programs. While we do not have the authority\nto enforce or provide incentives for adoption of certified Health IT Modules, other entities could\nchoose to do so. Should other federal entities choose to require certain systems or technologies to\ncertify to the criterion at § 170.315(f)(5) via other mechanisms, the applicability of the\nrequirements could extend beyond health IT that is traditionally presented for certification.\n\nAdditionally, developers of intermediary software may also voluntarily certify their technology\nthrough the Program without incentives or requirements.\n\nAs part of the Program, we do not require the use of specific systems or solutions, such as\nthe eCR Now FHIR App, which several commenters raised. Rather, we specify standards-based\nrequirements based on standards and implementation specifications that have been developed\nthrough consensus by the health IT industry and functional requirements to allow for flexibility\nand innovation. We are aware that the eCR Now FHIR App is an option for transmitting\nelectronic case reports using either the HL7 CDA IG or the HL7 FHIR eCR IG. We also are\n\n\n\n\n\n\naware of the CDC-supported data ingestion building blocks that can aid PHAs in converting\nincoming information from HL7 FHIR to HL7 CDA so that surveillance systems are able to\nprocess reports in the standards with which they can currently receive data. Developers of\ncertified health IT have the flexibility to leverage the eCR Now FHIR App or other solutions to\nmeet the requirements under our Program under existing requirements for § 170.315(f)(5).\n\nFurther, as developers of certified health IT work to implement either the CDA or FHIR\nstandards as part of their Health IT Modules, they can use “relied upon software” to demonstrate\ncertification criteria compliance (see 84 FR 7433 and 76 FR 1276-1277).<sup>51</sup>\nThis encompasses\nthird-party software or products that are not developed by the health IT developer but are being\nused to meet a portion of (or the entirety of) certain certification criteria. Such third-party\nproducts must be reported to the Certified Health IT Product List. We are aware that there are\nseveral technical options that meet our required functional criteria adhering to the FHIR\nstandard. Intermediaries, such as the AIMS platform supported by APHL, as well as other\nintermediaries such as HIEs or HINs, are used by healthcare organizations to assist with routing,\ntransport, and, in some cases, conversion before submitting electronic case reports to PHAs.\n\nHowever, we do not dictate the mechanism through which vendors or organizations choose to\naccomplish the electronic case reporting workflow—only the functional expectations and the\naccompanying standard(s). At this time, ONC is not requiring Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(f)(5) to specifically connect to AIMS or support RCKMS<sup>52</sup>\nto meet the proposed\nrequirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(D). While we understand the role AIMS and RCKMS play in\na centralized, hub-and-spoke model for electronic case reporting, we proposed that the functional\n\n\nFootnote 51:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/relieduponsoftwareguidance.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 52:\nhttps://www.rckms.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirements for § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(D) remain agnostic as to which reporting platform and which\ndecision support tool(s) are used. Further, the use of HL7 FHIR supports the use of RESTful\nAPIs. We will continue to coordinate and work with CDC on ensuring support is available as\nHealth IT Modules work toward Certification of the ”electronic case reporting” criterion,\nregardless of their approach. Given public comments and our desire to support providers\nreporting electronic case reports to any PHA that may be authorized to receive case reports, we\nhave finalized our requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(D) to “transmit a case report electronically\nto a system capable of receiving an electronic case report,” as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that systems be tested with “live” public\nhealth information systems, or systems specified by the public health community instead of self-\ncertifying that real world testing has been completed. The same commenter also recommended\nthat if a Health IT Module is certified only for CDA or FHIR exchange of RR data, the Health IT\nModule must also successfully complete real world testing with a commercially available service\nto transform the data into the format not implemented as part of the Health IT Module to ensure\nthe provider can receive RR messages regardless of the format utilized. One commenter\nrecommended that timely and or automated eRSD updates should be considered for inclusion in\nreal world testing. One commenter expressed that they appreciate the requirement to ensure\nHealth IT Modules continue to demonstrate conformance through real world testing.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and note that electronic case reporting is subject\nto the Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements at §\n170.405(a). However, we note that developers of certified Health IT Modules subject to real\nworld testing have extensive flexibility to design real world testing approaches that meet\nrequirements established in § 170.405(b)(1)(iii). We decline to establish specific requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor real world testing plans beyond what is established in § 170.405(b)(1)(iii) for electronic case\nreporting currently. We also note that our requirement for Health IT Modules certifying to §\n170.315(f)(5)(ii) to use either the FHIR-based or CDA-based IG is intended to facilitate\ninteroperability and should not necessitate support for multiple formats to receive RR messages.\n\nSeveral commenters were concerned about receiving RRs in a different standard than the sent\neICR, and we encourage the reporters to work with PHAs and intermediaries to limit the\npotential differentiation in standards used for eICR and RR, and to consider the use of potential\nsolutions that could convert the eICR or RR into the corresponding standard.\n\nWe have finalized the revised criterion for electronic case reporting in § 170.315(f)(5)\nwith modifications. First, we have finalized a modification of the proposed description in §\n170.315(f)(5) from “an electronic case report” to “a case report for electronic transmission”\nconsistent with the prior functional criterion in § 170.315(f)(5). Second, we have modified the\ndate from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025 for certification to the existing functional\ncriterion, which is now specified in § 170.315(f)(5)(i) Functional electronic case reporting. For\nthe standards-based version of the criterion in § 170.315(f)(5) and specified in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)\nStandards-based electronic case reporting, we have finalized a modification to the proposed\nregulation text to reference the Reportable Conditions Trigger Code value set in § 170.205(t)(4)\nwithout including the reference to the HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(A). We have\nfinalized a modification to the proposed regulation text as described above to reference only the\nHL7® CDA® eICR IG in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(B)(2). We have finalized a modification to the\nproposed regulation text for the capabilities described in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(C) by adding “as\ndetermined by the standard used in (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section.” Finally, we have finalized a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodification to § 170.315(f)(5)(ii)(D) to modify “capable of receiving an electronic case report”\nas follows: “Transmit a case report electronically to a system capable of receiving a case report.”\n\n\n",

              "text": "Since 2010, the Program has maintained a CDS certification criterion, consistent with the\nqualified electronic health record definition in section 3000(13) of the PHSA, which defines a\nqualified EHR as an electronic record of health-related information on an individual that has the\ncapacity to “provide clinical decision support” (42 U.S.C. § 300jj(13)(B)(i)). The initial\nrequirements for the CDS certification criterion were intended to ensure that Health IT Modules\nwould support broad categories of CDS while being agnostic toward the intended use of the CDS\nbeyond drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks (75 FR 2046).\n\nIn 2012, ONC established a new set of requirements for Health IT Modules to support\nCDS. These requirements included capabilities to support evidence-based CDS based on a\ndefined set of data elements; CDS configuration for both inpatient and ambulatory settings; and\nthe display of source attribute or bibliographic citation of CDS (77 FR 54212). These\nrequirements were largely based on recommendations made by ONC’s Health Information\nTechnology Policy Committee (HITPC)<sup>53</sup>\nfrom 2011 recommending ONC require Health IT\nModules support CDS, including: (1) display source or citation of CDS; (2) be configurable\nbased on patient context (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, problems, meds, allergies, lab results); (3) be\npresented at a relevant point in clinical workflow; (4) include alerts presented to users who can\nact on alerts (e.g., licensed professionals); and (5) be integrated with the EHR (i.e., not\n\n\nFootnote 53:\nHealth Informational Technology Policy Committee (HITPC) Transmittal Letter to the National Coordinator.

In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, ONC finalized an updated CDS criterion in §\n170.315(a)(9) (80 FR 62622).\n\nSince the CDS criterion was first adopted in § 170.315(a)(9), health IT implementation\nand technology resources used to support clinical decision-making have continued to evolve and\nexpand across the health IT ecosystem. Within healthcare today, predictive models are\nincreasingly being used and relied upon to inform an array of decision-makers, including\nclinicians, payers, researchers, and individuals, and to aid decision-making through CDS.<sup>54</sup>\nIn\nmany cases, Health IT Modules are key components of these predictive models, often providing\nthe data used to build and train algorithms and serving as the vehicle to influence day-to-day\ndecision-making.<sup>55</sup>\nBoth structured and unstructured data generated by, and subsequently made\navailable through, certified Health IT Modules power the training and real-world use of\npredictive models. Developers of certified health IT also create and deploy predictive algorithms\nor models for use in production environments through their Health IT Modules and, increasingly,\nsuch developers also enable other parties, including third-party developers and the developer of\ncertified health IT’s customers, to create and deploy predictive models through the developer’s\n\n\nFootnote 54:\nSee e.g., American Hospital Association. “Surveying the AI Health Care Landscape” 2019.\nhttps://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2019/10/Market_Insights_AI-Landscape.pdf; Darshali A Vyas, et al.,\nHidden in plain sight—reconsidering the use of race correction in clinical algorithms § 383 (Mass Medical Soc\n2020); Fact Versus Fiction: Clinical Decision Support Tools and the (Mis)use of Race.

In addition, E.O. 14110 directs HHS to establish a\nsafety program to receive reports of – and act to remedy – harms or unsafe healthcare practices\ninvolving AI (Section 8, subsection (b)(iv)).<sup>70</sup>\nA growing body of peer-reviewed evidence, technical and socio-technical expert\nanalyses, and government activities and reports focus on ensuring that the promise of AI and\nmachine learning can equitably accelerate advancements in healthcare to improve the health and\nwell-being of the American public.<sup>71</sup>\nThe Department has a longstanding interest in\nunderstanding and addressing concerns about negative, adverse, or harmful consequences that\nmay result from the use of digital data or information about individuals' health (including data\n\n\nFootnote 70:\nIn addition to the E.O., on November 1, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released draft guidance for\nfederal agencies, “Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial\nIntelligence” available at: https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AI-in-Government-Memo-Public-\nComment.pdf.\n\n\nFootnote 71:\nWe discuss additional federal and HHS activities – including activities resulting from the executive orders – in the\nsubsection below entitled “Relationship to Other Federal Agencies’ Relevant Activities, Interests, and Regulatory\nAuthority.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanalytics), including historically, their use in computerized decision-making.<sup>72</sup>\nAs such, we\nproposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23774–23811) to incorporate new requirements\ninto the Program for Health IT Modules that support the execution of AI or machine learning-\nbased technology in support of decision-making as part of the revised CDS criterion in §\n170.315(b)(11). These requirements align with the Federal Government’s efforts to promote\ntrustworthy AI and the Department’s stated policies on advancing equity in the delivery of health\nand human services.<sup>73</sup>\nWe believe that the continued evolution of decision support software, especially as it\nrelates to AI or machine learning-driven Predictive DSIs, necessitates new requirements for the\nProgram’s CDS criterion. We therefore proposed requirements for new sets of information that\nare necessary to guide decision-making based on outputs (e.g., recommendations) from\nPredictive DSIs, such as an expanded set of “source attributes” and information related to how\nrisk is managed by developers of certified health IT (88 FR 23775). We believe that these new\nsets of information will provide appropriate information to help guide decisions at the time and\nplace of care, consistent with 42 U.S.C. § 300jj–11(b)(4).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23746), we provided an overview of the history,\ncurrent uses, and risks associated with predictive algorithms and models in healthcare. We refer\nreaders to section III.C.5 of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for the details of those discussions (88 FR\n\n\nFootnote 72:\nSee e.g., U.S. Dep’t. of Health, Education, & Welfare (HEW), Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Automated\nPersonal Data Systems, Records, Computers, and the Rights of citizens viii (1973) https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/\nrecords-computers-and-rights-citizenshttps://aspe.hhs.gov/report/records-computers-and-rights-citizens (The\norigination of the code of fair information practices, more commonly known as the fair information practice\nprinciples (FIPPs)).\n\n\nFootnote 73:\nHHS, Statements on New Plan to Advance Equity in the Delivery of Health and Human Services, April 14, 2022,\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/04/14/hhs-statements-on-new-plan-advance-equity-delivery-health-human-\nservices.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23776 through 23781). We noted our goal with the proposals, described herein and as aligned\nwith our authority, was to assist in addressing the gaps between the promise and peril of AI in\nhealth articulated in the National Academy of Medicine report<sup>74</sup>\ndiscussed in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule (88 FR 23780).\n\nObjectives of the Policies to Address Predictive Modeling in DSI\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule at 88 FR 23780–23781, we noted that the proposals for §\n170.315(b)(11) were intended to introduce much-needed information transparency to address\nuncertainty regarding the quality of Predictive DSIs that Health IT Modules certified to the\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(11) support. We noted that doing so would equip potential users with\nsufficient information about how a Predictive DSI was designed, developed, trained, and\nevaluated to determine whether it was trustworthy (88 FR 23780). We proposed a dual emphasis\nfor transparency on (1) the technical and performance aspects of Predictive DSIs and (2) the\norganizational competencies employed to manage risks for Predictive DSIs. Together, this\ninformation would support potential users in making better informed decisions about whether\nand how to use Predictive DSIs in their decision-making given the specifics of their context,\npatients, and needs. We noted that we considered the information included in these proposed\nrequirements as a prerequisite to determine the quality of predictive models. We explained that\nour proposals were not aimed at approving or guaranteeing the quality of Predictive DSIs or the\nmodels on which they are based. Instead, the proposals were intended to provide users and the\npublic with greater information, available in a consistent manner, on whether a Predictive DSI is\n\n\nFootnote 74:\nMichael Matheny, et al., Artificial intelligence in health care: the hope, the hype, the promise, the peril,\nWASHINGTON, DC: NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe (FAVES). We anticipated that a long-term outcome of\nsuch transparency would be increased public trust and confidence in Predictive DSIs. As a result\nof new transparency, we anticipated that users, including healthcare systems, clinicians, and\npatients, would be able to expand the use of these technologies in safer, more appropriate, and\nmore equitable ways.\n\nWe did not propose to establish or define regulatory baselines, measures, or thresholds\nfor FAVES (88 FR 23780). Instead, we proposed to establish requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)\nto make information available that would enable users, based on their own judgment, to\ndetermine if a Predictive DSI, that is supported by a Health IT Module, is acceptably fair,\nappropriate, valid, effective, and safe. We conveyed our understanding that numerous and\nparallel efforts led by industry groups and academia were developing methods to evaluate\nPredictive DSIs for fairness, appropriateness, validity, effectiveness, and safety, among other\nkinds of evaluations. Moreover, we noted that we understood that these efforts were also\nidentifying means to communicate measures of FAVES through model cards,<sup>75</sup>\nmodel nutrition\nlabels,<sup>76</sup>\ndatasheets,<sup>77</sup>\ndata cards,<sup>78</sup>\nor algorithmic audits.<sup>79</sup>\nHowever, we also noted that these\nefforts lacked consensus and have not been widely or consistently implemented to date. We\ndescribed that we thought it would be premature to propose requirements for specific measures\n\n\nFootnote 75:\nMitchell, Margaret, et al. “Model cards for model reporting.” Proceedings of the conference on fairness,\naccountability, and transparency. 2019.\n\n\nFootnote 76:\nSendak MP, Gao M, Brajer N, Balu S.

Rather, we stated that the proposed requirements would enable\nconsistent and routine access to technical and performance information specifically relevant to\nFAVES, which would support users in making informed decisions about whether and how to use\nPredictive DSIs. While we stressed that transparency regarding the technical and performance\ndimensions of Predictive DSIs was needed, we also believed that transparency regarding the\norganizational and socio-technical competencies employed by those who develop Predictive\nDSIs was foundational for users to determine whether their Predictive DSI is FAVES. Therefore,\nin addition to the proposed requirements for Predictive DSI-specific source attributes, we also\nproposed that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface\nwith Predictive DSIs employ or engage in intervention risk management practices, subsequently\nmaking summary information about these practices publicly available.<sup>80</sup>\nWe proposed three\nintervention risk management practices: (1) risk analysis, (2) risk mitigation, and (3) governance\n(88 FR 23780). Overall, we identified these as practices that promote transparency regarding\nhow the developer of certified health IT analyzes and mitigates risks at the organization level,\nincluding proposals that would have such developers establish policies and implement controls\nfor governance, inclusive of how data are acquired, managed, and used in Predictive DSIs.\n\nTogether, transparency regarding the technical and performance details of a Predictive, as well as\nthe organizational competencies of the developer of certified health IT to manage risks for a\nPredictive DSI, were intended to contribute to the trustworthiness of these emerging and\nimportant technologies.\n\n\nFootnote 80:\nPublic availability and transparency aims align with the OSTP Memorandum to federal departments and agencies\n(August 2022): “Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research”\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-Memo.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noted at 88 FR 23780–23781 that the proposed requirements for the certification\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(11) also supported health equity by design,<sup>81</sup>\nfor example, (1)\nemphasizing transparency regarding the use of specific data elements relevant to health equity<sup>82</sup>\nin Predictive DSIs; (2) enabling users to review whether and how the Predictive DSI was tested\nfor fairness; and (3) enabling transparency about how developers of certified health IT manage\nrisks related to fairness for the Predictive DSIs their Health IT Modules enable or interface with.\n\nAt 88 FR 23781, we noted our belief that the existing scope and structure of the Program\nwere fit for these purposes because the Program has existing requirements to make information\ntransparent regarding the authorship, bibliography, and other kinds of “source attribute”\ninformation for evidence-based decision support and linked referential intervention types (at §\n170.315(a)(9)(v)(A) and (B), respectively). We proposed to build on these requirements so that\ndevelopers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) would\nneed to enable user review of evidence-based and Predictive DSIs within their certified products,\nand to disclose approach(es) to intervention risk management in a publicly accessible manner.\n\nTogether, we said these requirements would have an important impact on the Department’s\nefforts to address disparities and bias that may be propagated through DSIs. Consequently, we\nhoped to enhance market transparency and encourage trust across the software development life\ncycle (SDLC) of DSIs in healthcare. We said this transparency would serve as a foundation for\n\n\nFootnote 81:\nSee “Embracing Health Equity by Design” ONC, February 2022: https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-\nit/embracing-health-equity-by-design.\n\n\nFootnote 82:\nSee HHS’s Strategic Approach to Addressing Social Determinants of Health to Advance Health Equity – At a\nGlance (April 2022),\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/aabf48cbd391be21e5186eeae728ccd7/SDOH-Action-Plan-At-a-\nGlance.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestablishing consistency in information availability, improving overall data stewardship, and\nguiding the appropriate use of data derived from health information about individuals.\n\nAt 88 FR 23781, we noted that we were intentional regarding the level of\nprescriptiveness in our proposals because these are nascent technologies with enormous potential\nbenefit. Thus, we sought to establish appropriate guardrails for information transparency about\nPredictive DSIs that do not undercut the value that could be offered to patients and clinicians\nfrom such promising technologies.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were largely supportive of our DSI proposals but mixed in their\nsupport of the specifics of the DSI certification criterion we proposed in § 170.315(b) (11). Most\ncommenters stated that our proposals would increase transparency and accountability, enhance\ntrustworthiness in AI and machine learning-driven decision support tools, and promote risk\nmanagement by developers of certified health IT. Several commenters stated that these benefits\nwould lead to equitable access to healthcare, contribute to reducing health disparities during\nprovider-patient encounters, increase user and patient trust, and enhance patient experience.\n\nCommenters commended ONC’s efforts to prevent bias and discriminatory outcomes driven by\nDSIs and noted that a regulatory framework must be created whereby tools are appropriately\ntested and vetted during their development, and products are labeled to provide users with\nessential information.\n\nSeveral commenters applauded our effort to address transparency of rapidly evolving AI\nin healthcare. Commenters noted that adding new requirements for transparency around DSI\napplications’ technical information, risk management processes, and real-world testing are all\nfoundational steps in establishing these tools’ safe and effective use. Several commenters agreed\nwith our proposal that biases in the data and algorithms underlying AI or machine learning could\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnegatively impact certain subpopulations and supported more rigorous evaluation of such tools to\nensure that they are fair, effective, and support improved outcomes for patient populations.\n\nSpecifically, commenters remarked that greater transparency, including about the datasets used\nto train a Predictive DSI, would help avoid embedding bias in the system and help improve\nefficiency. Several commenters noted that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule would help lay the\nfoundations for responsible, ethical AI development in healthcare and for enhanced federal AI\ntransparency and will promote establishing necessary assurances for greater trust in AI use.\n\nCommenters acknowledged that due to the leaps in technological innovations, especially as it\nrelates to predictive models, it is necessary to have new requirements for the Program’s CDS\ncriterion. Several commenters agreed that it is critical for the end user to understand how a\nPredictive DSI is designed, developed, trained, and evaluated; and how it should be used by the\nend-user.\n\nCommenters approved of the proposal separately looking at risk analysis, risk mitigation,\nand governance as essential tasks in ensuring proper DSI development, management, and use.\n\nCommenters observed that the proposal, if adopted, would provide the opportunity for\ntransparent, thoughtful decision-making by enabling users, including medical practitioners,\nhealth care providers, and other interested parties of AI and algorithmic tools to evaluate,\ndisclose, and mitigate risks that could impact patients. Lastly, commenters urged ONC to be\nmindful that regulations on AI should not stifle innovation or have a chilling effect on beneficial\nuses of this emerging tool, and that we should seek to balance the risks and benefits to consumers\nof the public availability of information with the need to protect certain data to comply with the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule and limit adverse effects from a clinical standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their broad support of our proposals. We appreciate\nthat many commenters understood our policy objectives and agreed with our proposals to\nimprove trustworthiness through transparency in support of decision-making using AI machine\nlearning-driven tools. We agree with and thank commenters who noted that greater transparency,\nincluding about the datasets used to train Predictive DSI, would help avoid embedding bias in the\nsystem and help improve efficiency. We are also mindful of the need to balance prescriptiveness\nand flexibility in our requirements for developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11) and have made several modifications to our proposals, described in\ndetail in subsequent responses, to achieve this balance.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed requirements were\nnot strong enough to ensure DSIs are designed with equity in mind and fully validated for all\npatient populations when deployed and believed the HTI-1 Proposed Rule did not ensure\ndeveloper accountability. One commenter was concerned that the proposal did not address or\nrequire equity testing across patient populations to limit potential biases.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters concerns. We have finalized several requirements\nthat will help promote DSIs to be designed with health equity in mind, and we have finalized\nspecific requirements related to performance measures of validity and fairness.<sup>83</sup>\nOur proposal\nsought to ensure that information would be available for users to easily review whether a given\nmodel has been adequately validated and tested for fairness before using it, as well as enable\nusers to understand if a DSI used data elements relevant to health equity, such as race, ethnicity,\nand sexual orientation, among other data elements.<sup>84</sup>\nWe clarify that nothing from our proposals\n\n\nFootnote 83:\nSee § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(v)(5)-(9).\n\n\nFootnote 84:\nSee § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnor our finalized criterion would require a user of a Health IT Module certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) to review source attributes, though we also note that certain users may already\nhave an existing obligation to ensure compliance with non-discrimination requirements and\ncomply with applicable law.<sup>85</sup>\nComments. A minority of commenters did not support the proposed revised DSI\ncertification criterion, noting that it was premature for ONC to adopt policies related to AI or\nmachine learning. Some commenters expressed a belief that ONC’s proposed revised DSI\ncertification criterion’s requirements would exceed ONC’s authority, questioned whether ONC\nhad the authority to impose non-quality or efficacy criteria on Predictive DSI, and believed there\nwas not sufficient statutory support for the proposed revisions to DSI or authority over non-\ncertified software that is enabled by or interfaces with certified health IT. In particular,\ncommenters noted that ONC’s authority to adopt certification criteria is provided by section\n3001(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA and that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule would make changes to the\narchitecture of health software used by thousands of hospitals and health providers across the\ncountry, including software that would not be directly part of the Program. Commenters also\n\n\nFootnote 85:\nSee U.S. Dept of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4,\n2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-\nand-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English\nproficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, or disability in certain health programs or\nactivities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.

Given the proliferation of such tools used\nin healthcare and supplied by developers of certified health IT, we believe now is an opportune\ntime to help optimize the use and improve the quality of AI and machine learning-driven\ndecision support tools. Moreover, our statutory authority to promulgate regulations to define\ncertification criteria for the Program is established in 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11(c)(5)(A) and 300jj-\n14(b). The authority in 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA was added by section 4002(a)\nof the Cures Act and is specific to conditions of certification under the Program, which does not\nlimit the scope of the Program and, in fact, expanded the scope and applicability of the Program\nwith respect to developers of certified health IT. Moreover, since 2010, the Program has included\na certification criterion related to decision support in response to the definition established by\nCongress for qualified electronic health record, in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(13)(B)(i).<sup>86</sup>\nAt the time\nCongress included this specific capability within the qualified electronic health record\ndefinition, it did so without specific limits and in the context of the broader HITECH Act, and\nsubsequently the Cures Act, with the understanding that technology changes over time and so too\nwould certification criteria. Finally, we note that our authority to propose and finalize revisions\nto the Program’s DSI criterion is consistent with 42 U.S.C. 300jj-(c)(5) and fulfills several\npurposes enumerated by Congress in 42 U.S.C. 300jj-(b). The finalized requirements in §\n\n\nFootnote 86:\nONC finalized in § 170.304(e) the “clinical decision support” certification criteria in the interim final rule, \"Health\nInformation Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for\nElectronic Health Record Technology,\" January 13, 2010 (75 FR 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.315(b)(11), consistent with our authority, substantially focus on the responsibilities of\ndevelopers of certified health IT and the products these developers bring forward for\ncertification. Specifically, the updated criterion includes new sets of information that are\nnecessary to guide decision-making based on outputs (e.g., recommendations) from Predictive\nDSIs, including:\n• An expanded set of “source attributes” in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv);\n• Requirements for Health IT Modules to enable a limited set of identified users to access\ncomplete and up-to-date plain language descriptions of source attribute information in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v);\n• Requirements for intervention risk management practices to be applied for each\nPredictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi); and\n• Requirements for summary information related to how intervention risk is managed to be\npublicly accessible in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi).\n\nWe believe that these new sets of information will provide appropriate information to\nhelp guide decisions at the time and place of care, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 300jj–11(b)(4).\n\nAdditionally, our finalized policies in §§ 170.315(b)(11), 170.402(b)(4), and 170.523(f)(1)(xxi)\nwill support several other Congressionally-identified purposes that inform the National\nCoordinator’s work in carrying out their duties, including the duty identified in 42 U.S.C. 300jj-\n11(c)(5)(A). These additional purposes include 42 U.S.C. 300jj–11(b)(2), “improves health care\nquality, reduces medical errors, reduces health disparities, and advances the delivery of patient-\ncentered medical care”; 42 U.S.C. 300jj–11(b)(8), “facilitates health and clinical research and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth care quality”; 42 U.S.C. 300jj–11(b)(10), “promotes a more effective marketplace, greater\ncompetition, greater systems analysis, increased consumer choice, and improved outcomes in\nhealth care services”; and 42 U.S.C. 300jj–11(b)(11), “improves efforts to reduce health\ndisparities.”\n\nIn consideration of all the public comments received, and aligned with both the\nauthorities granted by Congress and directives established by several Executive Orders, we have\nfinalized most of our proposals for § 170.315(b)(11) with modifications intended to align and\nsimplify technical requirements between evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs as well as to\nclarify: (1) the definition of Predictive DSI in § 170.102; (2) the scope of technologies\nconsidered to be an evidence-based DSI for purposes of the Program; and (3) the scope of source\nattribute information that must be accessible to users. Specifically, we have finalized our\nproposals by significantly narrowing the scope of requirements for Predictive DSI-related source\nattributes and intervention risk management (IRM) practices to apply only to Predictive DSIs\nsupplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module. In addition to the detailed\nsection-by-section final rule discussions, the following paragraphs summarize some of the key\npolicy determinations included in this final rule.\n\nAdditionally, in consideration of comments received and the scope reductions we have\nmade to this final certification criterion, we determined that a supportive Maintenance of\nCertification requirement as part of the Assurances Condition of Certification is necessary to\nfully implement our policy objectives and proposals. Specifically, we have finalized in this final\nrule an “Assurances” Maintenance of Certification requirement at 45 CFR 170.402(b)(4) that\nstarting January 1, 2025, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, health IT developers with Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) review and update as necessary, source attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninformation in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) and (B), risk management practices described in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi), and summary information provided through § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi). This\nreinforces a health IT developer’s ongoing responsibility to enable users to access complete and\nup-to-date descriptions of DSI source attribute information at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) and (B) to\nreview and update as necessary IRM practices for all Predictive DSIs it supplies as part of its\nHealth IT Module, and to ensure the ongoing public availability of summary IRM practice\ninformation as submitted to their ONC-ACB via hyperlink in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi). We have\nfinalized that developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) will need to\ncomply with this Maintenance of Certification requirement starting January 1, 2025. We added\nthis Maintenance of Certification requirement to serve as a discrete connection for developers of\ncertified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) to ensure that their\nHealth IT Modules have complete and up-to-date descriptions of source attribute information and\nother required information, both at the time of certification and on an ongoing basis while their\nHealth IT Modules are certified to § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nWe have not finalized proposals related to the proposed Predictive DSI attestation\nstatement, and we will not require Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) to support\nlinked referential DSIs or related source attributes under the Program. Further, we have finalized\nmodifications to our proposal for IRM practices in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) and did not adopt the\nrequirement for detailed documentation we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(B). The finalized §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi) requires that IRM practices must be applied for each Predictive DSI supplied\nby the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, which is similar to how we described\nthe proposal in § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A) in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23798).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also finalized in § 170.102, as proposed, the date for which the requirements of\n§ 170.315(b)(11) must be satisfied for Health IT Modules to meet the definition of Base EHR.\n\nThis means that proposed changes to the Base EHR definition in § 170.102 that would allow a\nHealth IT Module to meet said definition if it has been certified to § 170.315(a)(9) or (b)(11) for\nthe period up to and including December 31, 2024, and § 170.315(b)(11) on and after January 1,\n2025, have been finalized as proposed. This also means that a developer of certified health IT\nwith a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must apply IRM practices for each\nPredictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) and\nsubmit summary information of their IRM practices to its ONC-ACB via publicly accessible\nhyperlink according to § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) before December 31, 2024. We note that we have\nfinalized, as discussed in section III.C.5.a.xiv, that the adoption of the criterion at §\n170.315(a)(9) for purposes of the ONC Health IT Certification Program expires on January 1,\n2025.\n\nTogether, these modifications reflect feedback received from numerous interested parties\nand are in response to both their support and opposition to our proposals. They are also intended\nto simplify Program requirements and support practical implementation of the certification\ncriterion by developers of certified health IT. We elaborate on the details of these and other\nfinalized policies more fully in subsequent responses of this final rule.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed at 88 FR 23782 through 23783 to adopt the certification criterion “decision\nsupport interventions,” (DSI) in § 170.315(b)(11) as a “revised certification criterion” according\nto the proposed definition in § 170.102. The proposed criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) was a revised\n\n\n\n\n\n\nversion of 45 CFR 170.315(a)(9), “clinical decision support (CDS).” In § 170.315(b)(11), we\nproposed to adopt a substantially similar structure as is currently in § 170.315(a)(9). In the\nrevised certification criterion at § 170.315(b)(11), we proposed to modify the existing\nrequirements in § 170.315(a)(9) to reflect an array of contemporary functionalities, data\nelements, and software applications that certified Health IT Modules support to aid decision-\nmaking in healthcare. We proposed that the policies established in § 170.315(a)(9)(i) through\n(iv) would be included as § 170.315(b)(11)(i) through (iv) with modifications. We proposed to\nintroduce a new intervention type in § 170.315(b)(11), Predictive DSIs, with a corresponding\ndefinition in § 170.102 for the term.\n\nAt 88 FR 23782, we discussed our rationale for these proposals and stated our view that\nproposed § 170.315(b)(11) reflected functionality that is better categorized as part of the “care\ncoordination certification criteria,” as opposed to the “clinical certification criteria,” supported\nby the Program. Hence, we proposed to adopt the “decision support intervention” certification\ncriterion in the “care coordination criteria” section adopted within § 170.315(b).\n\nAt 88 FR 23783, we proposed modifications to the Base EHR definition in § 170.102 to\nidentify the dates when § 170.315(b)(11) would replace § 170.315(a)(9) in the Base EHR\ndefinition. In keeping with the proposal to modify the Base EHR definition in § 170.102, we\nproposed that the adoption of § 170.315(a)(9) as part of the Program would expire on January 1,\n2025. We noted that if we finalized these proposals, developers of certified health IT with Health\nIT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) would need to certify those Health IT Modules to §\n170.315(b)(11) in order for those Health IT Modules to continue to meet the Base EHR\ndefinition. Lastly, as a consequence of the proposed adoption of this criterion in § 170.315(b),\nwe noted that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Module(s) certified to §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.315(b)(11) would be required to submit real world testing plans and corresponding real\nworld testing results, consistent with § 170.405.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters’ support was split with respect to the proposal to adopt the\ncertification criterion naming update of “decision support interventions,” or DSI, for\n§ 170.315(b)(11) as a “revised certification criterion” of 45 CFR 170.315(a)(9), “clinical\ndecision support” (CDS). Commenters in support noted that the proposal would promote greater\ntrust in DSI and predictive models through the Program. Commenters stated that distinguishing\nbetween CDS and DSI was warranted and that with the technological advancements in predictive\nanalytics, AI, and machine learning, the certification criterion needed to be updated to better\nreflect the market, and our proposal reflected contemporary and emerging functions, uses, and\ndata elements. Commenters who did not support the proposal recommended against renaming\nclinical decision support to decision support interventions because they stated the term\n“intervention” has other meanings within healthcare. Commenters suggested that retaining the\nname “clinical decision support” aligns better with the clinical decision support included in the\nlegislative definition of a qualified electronic health record.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ support for our proposal and agree that revising\nthe existing CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) as the DSI criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) is\nreflective of how decision support relies on increasing technological advancements in predictive\nanalytics, AI, and machine learning. We agree the Program should be updated to reflect these\nadvancements. While we appreciate the concerns raised regarding renaming the criterion from\nClinical Decision Support to Decision Support Interventions, we note that the term “evidence-\nbased decision support intervention,” has been part of the Program for nearly a decade, and we\nbelieve that removing “clinical” reflects the reality that Health IT Modules already support a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbroad array of decision support beyond what has been traditionally considered CDS. We also\nbelieve that the DSI criterion will continue to support the legislative definition of a qualified\nelectronic health record as it has since the inception of the Program. We note our discussion of\nthe term \"intervention\" was described in 88 FR 23786 and that the Program's use of the term\n“intervention” is different from “clinical intervention” as defined under FDA regulation that\nincludes a range of regulated products, such as a medication or medical device. We discuss the\nterm “intervention” in more detail in subsequent responses.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that ONC make Predictive DSI support a\nseparate certification criterion from the existing “clinical decision support” criterion to better\nfacilitate it being on a more extended timeframe for implementation and potentially impacting\ndifferent products, whereas other commenters were supportive of revising the criterion to\naccount for the rapid changes in this area of health IT.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments, but we decline to create a separate certification\ncriterion for Predictive DSIs. We believe that the current structure of the CDS criterion in §\n170.315(a)(9) is suitable to be implemented in a revised version in § 170.315(b)(11) and that this\napproach is more straight-forward than having substantially similar yet separate criteria. We\nhave not extended the timeframe for implementation from what we proposed because many of\nthe capabilities we have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11) are substantially similar to what already\nexists in § 170.315(a)(9) and because we have made other corresponding scope adjustments to\nthe finalized certification criterion. We agree with commenters who note that technology is\nchanging rapidly and there is a need for these policies to be implemented on a more accelerated\ntimeline from other requirements in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter consideration of these comments, we have finalized our proposal to adopt the “DSI\ncertification criterion” in § 170.315(b)(11) as a “revised certification criterion” according to the\nproposed definition in § 170.102 and as part of the “care coordination certification criteria,” in §\n170.315(b), including paragraph (b)(11)(i), which remains unchanged from paragraph (a)(9)(i).\n\nWe have also finalized inclusion of the certification criterion at § 170.315(b)(11) as part of the\nBase EHR definition in § 170.102, and that beginning January 1, 2025, the certification criterion\nat § 170.315(a)(9) would not be included in that definition. Among the numerous standards and\ncertification criteria proposed for revision by the end of 2024, the certification criterion in §\n170.315(b)(11) has been prioritized and finalized on the proposed timeline. Based on public\ncomment, we have lengthened the implementation timeline for nearly every other standard and\ncertification criterion proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, as well as made other timing\nadjustments that could impact prioritization for § 170.315(b)(11). We believe these final rule\nupdates will give developers of certified health IT time to focus on implementing the DSI\ncriterion at § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nFinally, as we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23783), as a consequence of\nadopting this revised criterion in § 170.315(b), developers of certified health IT with Health IT\nModule(s) certified to �§ 170.315(b)(11) are required to submit real world testing plans and\ncorresponding real world testing results, consistent with § 170.405, demonstrating the real world\nuse of each type of DSI in § 170.315(b)(11), including evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs.\n\nFinally, as we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23783), as a consequence of adopting\nthis revised criterion in § 170.315(b), developers of certified health IT with Health IT Module(s)\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11) are required to submit real world testing plans and corresponding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreal world testing results, consistent with § 170.405, demonstrating the real-world use of each\ntype of DSI in § 170.315(b)(11), including evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "At 88 FR 23783, we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii) to establish “decision support\nconfiguration” requirements based on what is currently in § 170.315(a)(9)(ii) with modifications\nand additional requirements. To reflect ONC’s focus on the USCDI and to acknowledge the\nvaried data for which DSIs may be enabled, we proposed that data elements listed in §\n170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)(i) through (iii) and (v) through (viii) be expressed according to the\nstandards expressed in § 170.213, including the proposed USCDI v3. We proposed to reference\nthe USCDI in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1) to define the scope of the data “at a minimum.” We\nnoted the intention was to establish baseline expectations that Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) must be capable of supporting DSIs that use those data elements listed in §\n170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1). We did not propose to establish requirements for specific interventions\nto be supported, only that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) be capable of\nsupporting interventions that use those listed data elements. This proposed requirement was\nframed to pertain to both evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs that would be enabled by or\ninterfaced with a certified Health IT Module, including any Predictive DSIs that were developed\nby users of the certified Health IT Module. We proposed to adopt in § 170.315(b)(11) the\nexisting reference in § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(1)(iv) to demographic data in § 170.315(a)(5)(i).\n\nAdditionally, at 88 FR 23783 we proposed to include two USCDI data classes not\ncurrently found in § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(1). In § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)(vii) – (viii), we\nproposed to include the Unique Device Identifier(s) for a Patient’s Implantable Device(s) and\nProcedures data classes, respectively, as expressed in the standards in § 170.213, including the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproposed USCDI v3. We proposed to require that Health IT Modules would support data from\nthe Procedures data class and the Unique Device Identifier(s) for a Patient’s Implantable\nDevice(s) data class as an input to DSIs. We invited comment on the additional data classes\ndescribed in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)(vii).\n\nAt 88 FR 23784, we proposed to adopt in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C) a new functionality to\nenable users to provide electronic feedback data based on the information displayed through the\nDSI. We proposed that a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must be able to export\nsuch feedback data, including but not limited to the intervention, action taken, user feedback\nprovided (if applicable), user, date, and location, so that the exported data could be associated\nwith other relevant data.\n\nAt 88 FR 23784, we proposed that such feedback data be available for export by users for\nanalysis in a computable format, so that it could be associated with other relevant data. We noted\nthat “computable format,” was consistent with current requirements in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(D) for\nEHI Export, and we clarified that “computable format” is also referred to as “machine readable,”\nin other contexts, which is not synonymous with “digitally accessible.”<sup>87</sup>\nWe did not propose to\nrequire specific formatting requirements for such feedback mechanisms.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters expressed support for the proposal to define the\nscope of data and supported the inclusion of USCDI v3 as the minimum set of data that should\nbe included stating that defining data elements according to the USCDI v3 standard would have\nthe benefit of improving transparency and increasing accuracy. Commenters recommended ONC\nsupport alignment efforts with standards development organizations (SDOs) and convene\n\n\nFootnote 87:\nSee also 85 FR 25879 discussion of machine readable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlistening sessions with DSI developers to align reporting efforts and to understand the\nappropriate minimum base sets of data for DSI technology. One commenter expressed concern\nthat the proposal to include USCDI v3 data elements was unclear and requested ONC clarify\nwhether a Health IT Module must support these data elements so external DSI solutions can be\nintegrated. One commenter expressed concern that the proposal for the data to be expressed in\nthe standards in § 170.213 was unclear and recommended including USCDI data elements\nindividually within the criterion for clarity on which elements would be required.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and feedback received during the\npublic comment period, and we have finalized several proposals based on such feedback. We\nthank the commenter for expressing their concern regarding our proposals to include the USCDI\nv3. We did not propose to establish requirements for specific interventions to be supported, only\nthat Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) be capable of supporting interventions that\nuse those listed data elements (88 FR 23783). The criterion at § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(1) listed\nmany of the same types of information, such as medications for example, but the criterion at §\n170.315(a)(9) did so without specifying a standard. As the result of our finalizing references to\nthe standards in § 170.213, we have provided clarity and better alignment with other certification\ncriteria in the Program. We appreciate the suggestion that we work with SDOs and coordinate\nlistening sessions with DSI developers. We will take these suggestions under consideration for\nfuture work, including potential future workshops, listening sessions, and advisory group task\nforces.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(A) with a minor modification to remove “(e.g.,\nsystem administrator)” from that provision (which is also in existing regulation text at §\n170.315(a)(9)(ii)(A)), as this example is unnecessary. We have also finalized the list of data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nelements proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1) with the following modifications in\nconsideration of comments. We have moved the list from proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)\nand finalized the list at § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A)(1) and finalized the list as proposed. We have\nfinalized the list of data elements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A)(1) because they establish a scope\nfor evidence-based DSIs that must be supported by Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) as well as scope the evidence-based DSIs that are subject to requirements in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v). Including the list in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A)(1) is intended to make this\nconnection clearer.\n\nWe note that elsewhere in this final rule we have finalized an expiration date in § 170.213\nfor USCDI v1 to occur on January 1, 2026. Consistent with the applicable dates for the versions\nof the USCDI in § 170.213, this means Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) need\nonly support the listed data elements according to the USCDI v1 standard until this time. A\nHealth IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11) may support the data elements according to the\nUSCDI v3 standard adopted in § 170.213 as of the effective date of this final rule. On and after\nJanuary 1, 2026, Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must support those listed data\nelements according to the USCDI v3 standard consistent with § 170.213.\n\nWe have also finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(2) as § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B) due to the\ncorresponding shift of the list of evidence-based DSI-related data elements noted above. We did\nnot propose any changes to § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B) in transposing the proposed regulatory text\nfrom the regulation text at § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(2), and we have finalized regulation text\nproposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(2) using existing language found at § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(2)\nat § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally expressed support for the proposal at §\n170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C) to enable users to provide electronic feedback based on the information\ndisplayed through the DSI and applauded including human-readable display. However, there was\nconcern among many commenters regarding the details of this proposal, including requirements\nthat Health IT Modules must be able to export feedback data, including but not limited to the\nintervention, action taken, user feedback provided (if applicable), user, date, and location, so that\nthe exported data can be associated with other relevant data. These concerns were generally\nrelated to how these requirements would impact usability, user interfaces, and ongoing\ninnovation of decision support tools. Specific commenters noted that capturing the “action\ntaken,” by a user would be particularly problematic and would degrade DSI to simple “yes/no”\ndesigns.\n\nCommenters suggested that we should limit the requirements to DSIs directly\nimplemented by a developer of certified health IT and limit the requirements to interruptive\nalerts, because passive alerts cannot have associated user actions. Other commenters\nrecommended the functionality to enable “feedback loops” be optional for users and that the\nrequirement pertain to evidence-based DSIs exclusively.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and thank commenters for their\nrecommendations. We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that this is the second time we have\nproposed a functionality that would require a Health IT Module to enable a user to provide\nelectronic feedback, also referred to as the capability to support “feedback loops,” on the\nperformance of DSIs implemented at the point of care (88 FR 23783). We note that in our 2015\nEdition Proposed Rule, we proposed to adopt new functionality that would require a Health IT\nModule certified to the CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) to be able to record at least one action\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntaken, and by whom it was taken, when a CDS intervention is provided to a user (e.g., whether\nthe user viewed, accepted, declined, ignored, overrode, provided a rationale or explanation for\nthe action taken, took some other type of action not listed here, or otherwise commented on the\nCDS intervention) (80 FR 16821). At the time, many commenters stated that current systems\nalready provided a wide range of functionality to enable providers to document decisions\nconcerning CDS interventions and that such functionality was unnecessary to support providers\nparticipating in the EHR Incentive Programs (80 FR 62622). However, subsequent research over\nthe last seven years indicates that “feedback loop” functionality is not widely available across\nHealth IT Modules certified to the CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9), but that such functionality\ncould be useful (88 FR 23784).\n\nWe appreciate the comments asking us to clarify to which DSI types our proposals would\npertain. We agree with commenters who indicated that feedback loop functionality would be\nmost appropriate for evidence-based DSIs. We have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C) to make\nclear that this functionality would only be required to apply to evidence-based decision support\ninterventions. We decline to limit this functionality to interruptive alerts only, but we believe that\ninterruptive alerts can be improved if user feedback data is applied to make such interruptions\nmore meaningful.\n\nWhile we are receptive to concerns regarding usability, we do not believe that the\nfinalized requirements to enable a user to provide electronic feedback on evidence-based DSIs\nconstrain or hinder usability or would lead to CDS degradation because this electronic feedback\ndata can be gathered in ways that are non-disruptive to users and we believe our requirements are\nsufficiently flexible to enable a user to provide feedback in a manner appropriate to their\nworkflow. Furthermore, we note that while Health IT Modules must support the capability at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C) in order to demonstrate conformance to the certification criterion, a user\nstill needs to choose to implement such functionality. A user would not be required to provide\nfeedback; rather, the capability to enable a user to provide electronic feedback is what must be\nincluded within the Health IT Module.\n\nWe clarify that only evidence-based DSIs that are actively presented to users in clinical\nworkflow to enhance, inform, or influence decision-making related to the care a patient receives\nmust be supported by the “feedback loop” functionality described in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C). We\nbelieve that scoping the requirement for feedback loops to these kinds of evidence-based DSIs\nwould be both appropriate to the goal of enabling ongoing quality improvement of DSIs, as\ndiscussed on 88 FR 23784–23785, and feasible for Health IT Modules to support. We also\nclarify that a Health IT Module must be able to make available feedback data to a limited set of\nidentified users for export in a computable format. This clarifies that while the Health IT Module\nmust enable any user to provide electronic feedback, the Health IT Module is not required to\nexport this feedback data to any user; rather, such an export of feedback data must be available to\na limited set of identified users.\n\nAs it relates to concerns regarding the “action taken,” requirement, we note that the\naction taken will be specific to the intended use of the evidence-based DSI. Actions could\ninclude whether the user viewed, accepted, declined, ignored, overrode, or modified the DSI in\nsome way. At this time, we decline to require an enumerated list of “actions taken” be supported.\n\nWe believe that developers of certified health IT and their customers are better positioned to\ndetermine the range of actions that are appropriate as part of feedback data.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed at 88 FR 23784 to establish “evidence-based\ndecision support interventions” at § 170.315(b)(11)(iii), with a minor revision to current\nrequirements that are part of the CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9)(iii). We explained that this\nproposal would replace the current construct in § 170.315(a)(9)(iii), which states a Health IT\nModule must enable evidence-based decision support interventions “based on each one and at\nleast one combination of” the data referenced in paragraphs § 170.315(a)(9)(ii)(B)(1)(i) through\n(vi). We proposed that Health IT Modules supporting evidence-based DSIs must have the ability\nto support “any,” meaning all, of the revised data referenced in paragraphs of proposed §\n170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)(i) through (viii). We noted this proposal would broaden the scope of\ndata elements that Health IT Modules must support when enabling evidence-based DSIs to\ninclude 15 data elements expressed by the standards in § 170.213, including USCDI v3, which\nwe proposed to adopt in § 170.213(b) elsewhere in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. The HTI-1\nProposed Rule did not prescribe the intended use of the evidence-based DSI. Rather, the\nproposed subparagraph at § 170.315(b)(11)(iii), in combination with the data referenced in §\n170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1), represented the scope of evidence-based DSIs and scope of data that\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) should enable for purposes of certification under\nour Program.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were generally evenly split on their support for the proposal to\nestablish “evidence-based decision support interventions,” with a minor revision to current\nrequirements that are part of the CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9)(iii), with those in support\nnoting that it would ensure that decision support systems are founded on the latest scientific\nresearch and clinical guidelines and assist healthcare professionals in making informed and\neffective choices that are supported by robust evidence. One commenter appreciated that we\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndifferentiated between predictive and evidence-based DSIs to support decision-making. One\ncommenter noted that they believed it is critical that ONC account for the needs of clinical\nguideline developers so that undue burdens are not placed on the guideline development process\nas DSI tools are developed and implemented in part based on clinical guidelines.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. We have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) with\naccompanying modifications and clarifications. As articulated in more detail in subsequent\nresponses, we clarify that evidence-based DSIs, for purposes of requirements in §\n170.315(b)(11), are limited to only those DSIs that are actively presented to users in clinical\nworkflow to enhance, inform, or influence decision-making related to the care a patient receives\nand that do not meet the definition for Predictive Decision Support Intervention at § 170.102.\n\nActively presented stands in contrast to decision support that initiates an action without a user’s\nknowledge or occurs outside a user’s normal workflow. We believe this clarification will help\ninterested parties differentiate between evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs and delineate\nwhich requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) pertain to these DSI types. We also note that some data\nelements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A) are not part of USCDI v1 and are only in USCDI v3. For\nthe time period before the expiration date of USCDI v1, Health IT Modules are not required to\nsupport evidence-based DSIs that are based solely on data elements included in USCDI v3.\n\nHowever, beginning January 1, 2026, Health IT Modules must support DSIs based on all—\nmeaning each—USCDI v3 data element listed in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters not in support of the proposal expressed concern that the\ndefinition of evidence-based DSI was too broad and would encompass a large number of baseline\nfunctionality and capabilities within an EHR including passive and active alerts, order sets, care\nplans and protocols, simple rules and calculations, references ranges, age and weight based\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndosing and reminders for preventative care. Commenters sought more clarity related to how\nevidence-based and Predictive DSIs were defined and should be supported. Specifically,\ncommenters noted concerns related to consistently determining what types of functionalities\nqualify as an evidence-based DSI, a Predictive DSI, or neither. Commenters also noted that\nEHRs support a vast number of financial and reimbursement rules to support medical necessity\nand reimbursement. The commenters recommended that the definition of evidence-based DSI\nalign with the current § 170.315(a)(9) definition of clinical decision support and that the §\n170.315(a)(9) certification criterion remain unchanged until future rulemaking can more clearly\ndefine the criterion and specific priority use cases beyond clinical.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns and understand there is substantial\nconfusion regarding the scope of what constitutes an evidence-based DSI as well as\ncorresponding requirements for evidence-based DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11). In the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule we included background information indicating that the initial CDS criterion, established in\n2010, required that a Health IT Module could: (1) implement rules, “according to specialty or\nclinical priorities;” (2) “automatically and electronically generate and indicate in real-time, alerts\nand care suggestions based upon clinical decision support rules and evidence grade;” and (3)\ntrack, record, and generate reports on the number of alerts responded to by a user (75 FR 2046).”\n\n(88 FR 23774). Since this time, the CDS criterion has remained agnostic to use case, except for\ndrug-drug and drug-allergy contraindication checking, requiring Health IT Modules to enable the\nuse of a variety of tools based on a specified set of data, including problems, medications,\ndemographics, and laboratory data. While this framing has ensured that users have access to a\nbroad range of tools, for a wide array of purposes, related to decision support through Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModules certified to the CDS criterion, we now believe some clarity is needed to refine the scope\nof evidence-based DSIs for the purposes of requirements in § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nWe noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we were not establishing requirements for\nspecific interventions to be supported, only that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11)\nbe capable of supporting interventions based on specified data (as proposed in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B)(1)(i) through (viii) (88 FR 23783)). We also noted in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule that the term “intervention,”<sup>88</sup>\nis specific to “an intervention occurring within a workstream,\nincluding but not limited to alerts, order sets, flowsheets, dashboards, patient lists,\ndocumentation forms, relevant data presentations, protocol or pathway support, reference\ninformation or guidance, and reminder messages,” (88 FR 23786).\n\nGiven the confusion conveyed through comments received from many interested parties\nregarding the scope of what decision support is considered evidence-based decision support, we\nclarify that for purposes of requirements in § 170.315(b)(11), evidence-based DSIs are limited to\nonly those DSIs that are actively presented to users in clinical workflow to enhance, inform, or\ninfluence decision-making related to the care a patient receives and that do not meet the\ndefinition for Predictive DSI at § 170.102.<sup>89</sup>\nIn the context of Program requirements, this means\nthat if a developer of certified health IT with a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11)\n\n\nFootnote 88:\nThe ONC Program's use of the term “intervention” is different from “clinical intervention” as defined under FDA\nregulation that includes a range of regulated products, such as a medication or medical device. We note that there\nmay be a software-as-a-medical device (SaMD) that is considered a “clinical intervention” and subject to FDA\nauthority.\n\n\nFootnote 89:\nWe note that this clarification is aligned with FDA’s Clinical Decision Support Software Guidance, specifically\nthe software functionalities described under Criterion 3, which refers to condition-, disease-, or patient-specific\nrecommendations to a health care professional to enhance, inform, or influence a health care decision. Note that we\nreference the FDA CDS Guidance only to clarify the scope of which kinds of evidence-based DSIs are subject to\napplicable requirements in § 170.315(b)(11). See https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-\ndocuments/clinical-decision-support-software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenables a user to select an evidence-based DSI that is actively presented in clinical workflow to\nenhance, inform, or influence decision-making related to the care a patient receives that\nevidence-based DSI would be subject to the requirements that apply to evidence-based DSIs\nwithin § 170.315(b)(11). We note that if the DSI in question meets the definition of Predictive\nDSI at § 170.102, then requirements that apply to those types of interventions within §\n170.315(b)(11) would be applicable. Additionally, we clarify that “actively presented,” is\ninclusive of, but not limited to, “interruptive alerts,” and we clarify that “related to the care a\npatient receives,” would include use cases related to direct patient care as well as use cases that\nimpact care a patient receives. For example, a decision support rule that recommends a follow-up\nappointment within 12 weeks according to United States Preventive Services Taskforce\n(USPSTF) recommendations would be considered an evidence-based DSI for purposes of\nProgram requirements. These clarifications stand in contrast to back-end systems rules that are\nnot presented to users and are not related to care an individual patient receives, such as those\nused for resource management or back-end logic that may support an organization’s business\nrules but are not part of a user’s workflow. Such rules and tools would not be considered an\nevidence-based DSI for the purposes of this certification criterion.\n\nBeyond this clarification, we have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) by changing the title of\nthe paragraph from proposed “Evidence-based decision support interventions,” to “Decision\nsupport intervention selection” and included explicit instruction for Health IT Modules to enable\na limited set of identified users to select (i.e., activate) decision support interventions (in addition\nto drug-drug and drug-allergy contraindication checking) that are evidence-based DSIs and\nPredictive DSIs. We have finalized the same requirement for all DSI types recognized in the\nProgram, be they evidence-based DSIs or Predictive DSIs, because the technical capability to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenable a user to select (i.e., activate) is the same regardless of the type of DSI being activated. As\ndescribed in more detail below, Program requirements to enable a user to select a DSI is\ncontingent only on the data elements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A) (for evidence-based DSIs) and §\n170.213 (for Predictive DSIs) and supportive of various use cases.\n\nAs discussed in more detail in the section III.C.5.v. “Predictive Decision Support\nInterventions, Attestation for Predictive Decision Support Interventions,” we did not adopt the\nPredictive DSI attestation statement proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(v) in this final rule and we\nhave narrowed the overall scope of technologies impacted by finalized requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11). Given these changes, certain adjustments to the certification criterion were\nnecessary to simplify, clarify, and align technical requirements that could be shared between\nevidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs. We believe these adjustments directly respond to\ncommenter confusion and help reduce the technical updates that developers will need to\ncomplete in response to final requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) as they will be able to build on\nand extend existing capabilities to support Predictive DSIs. This is particularly true with respect\nto the capability expressed at final § 170.315(b)(11)(iii). Further, the alignment of evidence-\nbased DSI and Predictive DSI capabilities will help provide for a consistent experience for those\nusers identified to select DSIs pursuant to final § 170.315(b)(11)(iii).\n\nWhile we specifically discussed evidenced-based DSIs in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88\nFR 23784) with respect to proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(iii), we did not (aside from the paragraph\ntitle) expressly limit the scope of the proposed regulation text to evidenced-based DSIs – instead\nfocusing on “electronic decision support interventions.” Moreover, at 88 FR 23783, we noted\nthat requirements proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(ii) for DSI configuration “would pertain to both\nevidence-based DSIs and predictive DSIs that are enabled by or interfaced with a certified health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT Module, including any predictive DSIs that are developed by users of the certified Health IT\nModel.” We have addressed these ambiguities in finalized regulation text at § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)\nand appreciate the comments that sought more clarity related to the shared uses expected for\ncertification for evidence-based and Predictive DSIs.\n\nWe note that the capability in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) is consistent with the historic and\ncurrent expectation for evidence-based DSIs in § 170.315(a)(9)(iii) and we reiterate that this\ncapability does not require a developer of certified health IT with a Health IT Module certified to\n§ 170.315(b)(11) to author, develop, or otherwise support a specific evidence-based DSI or\nPredictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that ONC reconsider including Unique Device\nIdentifier(s) for a Patient’s Implanted Devices as a required element, or alternatively recognize\nthat any DSI around Unique Device Identifier(s) is likely to only use certain elements of the\nUnique Device Identifier, not the full Unique Device Identifier – particularly the Device\nIdentifier – and suggested that adoption as a required element for support via evidence-based\nDSIs is unnecessary at this stage.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we\nbelieved that data regarding a patient’s procedures and whether a patient has an implantable\nmedical device, as indicated by a unique device identifier (UDI), can play a significant role in\ncontemporary DSIs (88 FR 23783). As a result, we proposed to require that Health IT Modules\nwould support data from the Procedures data class and the Unique Device Identifier(s) for a\nPatient’s Implantable Device(s) data class as an input to DSIs. The addition of UDI complements\nmedications and proposed procedures as an important focal point for various decision support\ninterventions, including those related to MRIs, post-implant clinical care, among other care\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscenarios (88 FR 23783). We note that under this requirement, a Health IT Module would be\nrequired to enable an evidence-based DSI that included a UDI as expressed in the standards in §\n170.213, and we clarify this requirement is affirmed regardless of whether the full UDI is part of\nthe intervention or a component of the full UDI, such as the device identifier or the production\nidentifier. Both identifiers are required to be supported as a part of USCDI v1 (§ 170.213(a)) and\nv3 (§ 170.213(b)).<sup>90</sup>\nComments. One commenter requested clarification on whether algorithms that use patient\nmedical/demographic information to provide patient-specific screening, counseling, and\npreventive recommendations by mapping to well-known and established authorities are\nconsidered evidence-based DSI unless there is a “predicted value.” The commenter questioned if\nscenarios where the algorithm is calculating a risk value based on a pre-defined deterministic\nclinical guideline are included.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this point. We note that to be\nconsidered a Predictive DSI, a function or technology must meet all parts of the definition in §\n170.102. Namely, it must support decision-making based on algorithms or models that derive\nrelationships from training data and then produce an output that results in prediction,\nclassification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. Based on the information presented by\nthis commenter, we do not believe a risk score based on a deterministic clinical guideline would\nbe considered a Predictive DSI. Rather, this would be considered an evidence-based DSI.\n\nHowever, we note that whether a technology meets the definition of Predictive DSI is fact based,\nand this response should not be understood as determinative.\n\n\nFootnote 90:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/uscdi-data-class/unique-device-identifiers-a-patients-implantable-devices#uscdi-v1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter noted that for non-predictive CDS certified to existing ONC\nstandards, the new transparency requirements related to patient demographics, social\ndeterminants of health, and health status assessments would be difficult to implement as such\ninformation is often not available to the CDS developer and recommended that ONC not require\nthis for certified CDS but encourage it when such information is available.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and we note that our requirements for evidence-\nbased DSIs related to source attributes is substantially unchanged from the existing requirements.\n\nWe describe in more detail our final policy for source attributes in the section “vi. Source\nAttributes.” However, we will require that users can review whether and which patient\ndemographics, social determinants of health, and health status assessments data are used as part\nof an evidence-based DSI.\n\n\n",

We welcomed comment regarding the functionalities\nand standards listed in § 170.315(a)(9)(iv), the HL7 Context Aware Knowledge Retrieval\nApplication (“Infobutton”) standards, including whether linked referential CDS were commonly\nused with, or without, the named standards in § 170.315(a)(9)(iv)(A)(1) and (2) and whether we\nshould continue to require use of these standards.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters were in support of removing the linked\nreferential CDS provisions from the scope of the criterion, noting that it emphasizes the shift in\nfocus to AI and machine learning-based DSI technology and removes a requirement that has\nbeen of little value for health care providers. In particular, commenters were supportive of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremoving the HL7 Context Aware Knowledge Retrieval Application (“Infobutton”) standards\nfrom the scope of the criterion, noting that removal is appropriate because there is low utilization\nfor this standard, there is significant expansion of the proposed criterion in the areas of evidence-\nbased and Predictive DSI, it would help streamline the certification process, and that customers\nperceive it as lacking value to clinical workflow in favor of traditional evidence-based CDS\ninterventions. However, one commenter strongly supported retention of the “Infobutton”\nstandard for linked referential DSIs but did not provide a rationale.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their recommendations. We agree with commenters\nthat “infobuttons,” while helpful and useful in some contexts, no longer need to be mandated as\npart of the revised criterion at § 170.315(b)(11). We also note that the “infobutton” standard has\nnot been updated for several years (since 2014). As part of an effort to streamline and update the\nhistoric criterion at § 170.315(a)(9), we have finalized § 170.315(b)(11) without proposed\nparagraph (b)(11)(iv) Linked referential DSI and associated subparagraphs. We anticipate that\n“infobuttons” and other linked referential DSIs will continue to be used where they provide value\nwithout a requirement in the Program. We believe that removal of this requirement as part of the\nrevised certification criteria at § 170.315(b)(11) will reduce overall burden and focus\nrequirements on evidence-based and Predictive DSIs.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter was supportive of our proposal to include “linked referential\nDSIs” in the Program, noting that it has the advantage of equipping health care providers with\ncomprehensive and up-to-date resources, thus empowering them to make well-informed\ndecisions by drawing upon a wealth of knowledge and clinical expertise, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenter’s support for the requirement. However, we\nhave finalized § 170.315(b)(11) without requiring “Linked referential DSIs.” We reiterate that in\ncircumstances where linked referential DSIs and “infobuttons” are providing value, nothing in\nthis final rule would inhibit their use. Furthermore, nothing in this final rule should be used to\ninhibit the use of diagnostic and therapeutic reference information or any associated\nbibliographic information that is part of the linked referential DSI.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed at 88 FR 23784 to reference a new intervention type, “predictive decision\nsupport intervention,” in § 170.315(b)(11)(v), and we proposed a corresponding definition in\n§ 170.102. We also proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) that developers of certified health IT\nwith Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) attest “yes” or “no” as to whether their\nHealth IT Module enables or interfaces with one or more Predictive DSIs based on any of the\ndata expressed in the standards in § 170.213, including USCDI v3, which we also proposed at 88\nFR 23746.\n\nDefinition of Predictive Decision Support Intervention\nWe proposed at 88 FR 23784 - 23785 a definition of “predictive decision support\nintervention,” (again hereafter referenced as Predictive DSI) in § 170.102 to mean “technology\nintended to support decision-making based on algorithms or models that derive relationships\nfrom training or example data and then are used to produce an output or outputs related to, but\nnot limited to, prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis.” We explained\nthat such Predictive DSIs are based on the use of predictive model(s), and that “model” refers to\na quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, bioinformatic,\nmathematical, or other techniques (e.g., algorithm or equations) to process input data into\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquantitative estimates. We also discussed our use of the phrase “intended to support decision-\nmaking” to be interpreted broadly and to encompass technologies that require users’\ninterpretation and action to implement as well as those that initiate patient management without\nuser action and require action to contest. We also noted that our use of Predictive DSI was not\ntied to who developed it, the level of risk or degree to which the Predictive DSI informs or drives\ntreatment, is relied upon by the user, relates to time sensitive action, or whether the Predictive\nDSI is augmentative or autonomous.<sup>91</sup>\nWe differentiated Predictive DSIs as those that support\ndecision-making by learning or deriving relationships to produce an output, rather than those that\nrely on pre-defined rules based on expert consensus, such as computable clinical guidelines, to\nsupport decision-making.\n\nWe noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that our definition of Predictive DSI was intended\nto cover a wide variety of techniques from algebraic equations to machine learning and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) (88 FR 23785). We mentioned the Acute Physiology and Chronic\nHealth Evaluation IV (APACHE IV) model, which predicts in-hospital mortality for patients in\nintensive care units and was initially trained and validated with data from 45 hospitals, including\nover 100,000 individuals in 2006 (88 FR 23785). We also mentioned that models designed to\nestimate risk of a first Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, trained and validated on pooled\ncohorts of large studies as examples of common and in-scope models for our definition of\n\n\nFootnote 91:\nSee generally IMDRF | Software as a Medical Device: Possible Framework for Risk Categorization and\nCorresponding Considerations: https://www.imdrf.org/documents/software-medical-device-possible-framework-\nrisk-categorization-and-corresponding-considerations.\n\nSee AMA | CPT® Appendix S: Artificial Intelligence Taxonomy for Medical Services and Procedures:\nhttps://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/cpt-appendix-s.pdf for definitions of “augmentative” and “autonomous”;\nANSI/CTA Standard, The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Trustworthiness ANSI/CTA-2090:\nhttps://shop.cta.tech/collections/standards/products/the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-trustworthiness-\ncta-2090?_ga=2.195226476.1947214965.1652722036-709349392.1645133306.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive DSI. We also noted that more complex models, for instance ones developed by\ncombining multiple algorithms or deep neural networks trained and validated on over ten\nthousand individuals, that can be applied to patients in operational contexts would meet the\nproposed definition. So too would our definition include models that were adaptive, online or\nunlocked, which continue to adapt when exposed to new data, as well as those that are locked to\nthe relationships learned in training data.\n\nAs proposed in § 170.102, the definition of Predictive DSI would not include simulation\nmodels that use modeler-provided parameters rather than training data or unsupervised machine\nlearning techniques that do not predict an unknown value (i.e., are not labeled) (88 FR 23786).\n\nFor instance, the use of an unsupervised learning model within decision support would not meet\nour definition of Predictive DSI, nor would the use of developer-supplied parameters to simulate\noperating-room usage and develop an effective scheduling strategy. We refer readers to 88 FR\n23784–23786 for the discussion on the definition of Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were mixed in their support for the proposed definition of\nPredictive DSI, with those in support noting that it provides broad flexibility, comprehensively\nencompasses AI, and accurately highlights its distinction from any other potential sources of\ndecision support interventions that do not involve modeling. Some commenters expressed\nsupport particularly for including complex predictive models leveraging machine learning in the\nproposed definition, noting that this recognition serves as a necessary step to combat bias and\npromote equity amid the growing number and increased use of AI tools.\n\nWhile many commenters broadly supported the intent and goals of the proposed\ndefinition for Predictive DSI, other commenters expressed concern that the proposed definition\nwas too broad and should be narrowed in several ways to provide clarity on the scope of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntechnologies covered to prevent burden on health IT developers and health care providers. Other\ncommenters noted that a broad definition of Predictive DSI creates confusion for what\ntechnology must be scoped for certification. Notably, many commenters suggested revising the\ndefinition to clarify that Predictive DSI means technology intended to support clinical or medical\ndecision-making to ensure organizational and administrative decision making are excluded from\nthe definition to limit the documentation requirements to demonstrate compliance and limit the\nnumber of citations in the system to alleviate user burden. For instance, one commenter\nsuggested that ONC add the term “clinical” so that Predictive DSI means “Predictive decision\nsupport intervention means technology intended to support clinical decision-making based on\nalgorithms or models that derive relationships from training or example data and then are used to\nproduce an output or outputs related to, but not limited to, prediction, classification,\nrecommendation, evaluation, or analysis.” Commenters recommended that the definition be\nlimited to high risk DSIs, and that it should exclude certain health care providers, such as those\nthat develop their own DSI and do not make it commercially available. Commenters also\nrequested that we reconsider the proposals to apply a more limited scope that centers on\nfunctionality that necessitates the granular transparency of source attributes and feedback\ncapabilities for end-users that ONC proposed.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support from those commenters that said our definition\ncomprehensively encompasses AI, and accurately highlighted the definition’s distinction from\nany other potential sources of decision support interventions that do not involve modeling. We\nsought to establish a definition that was both broad and appropriate. Consistent with our rationale\nto move from CDS to DSI in Program nomenclature, we sought to establish a definition that\nencompassed the broad forms that algorithm and model-based decision support interventions can\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntake and for which transparency regarding the performance of that model would benefit users,\nand would help users determine whether the technology they are using is fair, appropriate, valid,\neffective, and safe. We also sought to establish a definition that did not include a range of simple\nalerts and functions that would not benefit from the sorts of transparency our requirements would\nportend. However, we note there are many recent examples92,93,<sup>94</sup>\nwhere the task of delineating\nbetween those predictive algorithms and models can have unintended consequences.\n\nWe thank commenters for their critiques of our definition. Many commenters said that\nour definition was too broad, and a small minority of these commenters offered specific\nsuggestions on how to reduce the scope of our definition. We thank those commenters,\nespecially. We understand that many algorithms not directly supporting medical decision making\ncan nevertheless impact the delivery of healthcare (e.g., algorithms supporting scheduling or the\nprovision of supplies), and so have not sought to limit the definition to models specifically\ninforming medical decision making. Overall, we found that many other commenters did not\nconsider our definition for Predictive DSI as a whole; rather, these commenters chose to isolate\ncertain phrases or aspects of the definition to question its scope and its applicability to specific\nuse cases. As stated, our intention with the definition of Predictive DSI is to be expansive beyond\nthe traditional role of CDS, yet appropriate to the dynamic technology environment that\nPredictive DSIs may be applied. Toward these two intentions, we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule that we differentiate Predictive DSIs as those that support decision-making by learning or\n\n\nFootnote 92:\nSamorani M., Harris S.

Taken alongside the rest of the definition, this\ndistinction is intended to preclude the vast number of alerts or reminders that are either based on\nconsensus clinical guidelines or bespoke business processes and organizational policies that may\nor may not be based on any guideline.\n\nWe also noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that our definition is not tied to the level of\nrisk (88 FR 23785) and our certification criterion for CDS was established to ensure that Health\nIT Modules support broad categories of CDS while being agnostic toward the intended use of the\nCDS beyond drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks (88 FR 23774). We did not propose\nto alter that construct in our proposals. However, we are sensitive to defining Predictive DSIs in\na way that makes clear which technologies are in scope for § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nWe also decline to limit the definition to a specific source or developer of the\nintervention, although additional facets of the final policy define the applicable scope of §\n170.315(b)(11).\n\nWe have finalized our proposed definition for Predictive DSI with modification.\n\nSpecifically, we have finalized the definition in § 170.102 as follows: “Predictive decision\nsupport intervention or Predictive DSI means technology that supports decision-making based on\nalgorithms or models that derive relationships from training data and then produce an output that\nresults in prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis.” We note that this\nversion of the definition is not markedly different from the definition we proposed, but we intend\nit to be more exacting. Thus, the examples and discussion regarding scope in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule remain relevant to this definition (88 FR 23784–23786). To help interested parties better\nunderstand the scope of technologies included in this definition we reiterate the following: The\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopment process whereby models under this definition “learn” relationships in training data\nand then are used to generate an unknown label or value (via prediction, classification,\nrecommendation, evaluation, or analysis) that is based on the “learned” relationships is a\nfundamental differentiator from evidence-based DSIs. While we appreciate commenters’ request\nto limit or constrain the scope of the Predictive DSI definition based on its intended purpose or\nuse (e.g., clinical and medical versus administrative), level of risk (e.g., high versus low), and\nentity or party that developed the technology (e.g., health care provider that self-develops versus\ntechnology company that sells Predictive DSIs), we do not believe such an approach would be\nappropriate. We believe that the transparency requirements within this criterion are appropriate\nto all Predictive DSIs used within the context of certified health IT, given the potential of these\nPredictive DSIs to impact the delivery of healthcare at vast scale. We believe that constraining\nthe definition of Predictive DSI by intended purposes, level of risk, or developing entity would\ncreate multiple layers of complexity and lead to different requirements for technology that may\nhave qualities that pertain to one or more of these dimensions or exist along a spectrum of these\nconcepts. We believe that a broad and consistently applied definition will improve the likelihood\nof achieving our stated goals for transparency and trustworthiness.\n\nWe note that the definition of Predictive DSI is aligned with and within the scope of the\ndefinition of Artificial Intelligence at 15 U.S.C. 9401(3), as used in E.O. 14110, Safe, Secure,\nand Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (88 FR 75191). Predictive DSIs\nperceive environments through the use of training data; abstract perceptions into models as they\nlearn relationships in that data; and produce an output, often for an individual, through inference\nbased on those learned relationships. We further note that evidence-based DSI likely represents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanother form of Artificial Intelligence, though that form is fundamentally based on rules-based\nmodels.\n\nWe also clarify that the exclusion of unsupervised learning models discussed at 88 FR\n23786 was intended to focus on models trained in data without labels. This exclusion reflected\nour understanding that it is not feasible to produce descriptions for many of the source attributes\nwe are requiring for Predictive DSI. For example, unsupervised models are generally based on\ndata without labels, which often generate measures of similarity or closeness of observations\nrather than a predicted value. In these instances, assessing the accuracy, validity and fairness of a\nprediction would be difficult, if not impossible, because the outcome is not specified. The\nexclusion of unsupervised learning models is embedded in the definition because the definition\nfocuses on “relationships in training data,” which generally refers to the relationship between\nsome set of data (sometimes referred to as inputs, features, or predictors) and an outcome or label\n(such as a diagnosis or the next word in a string). In contrast, unsupervised learning models rely\nmore generally on patterns in data. We further clarified this exclusion in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule at 88 FR 23786 and maintain the exclusion in the final definition.\n\nThese unsupervised models contrast with LLMs and other forms of generative AI, which\noften leverage self-supervised learning wherein the data itself provides a label (e.g., the next\nword in a string of text) and the model returns a predicted value of that label as output, in which\ncase the accuracy, validity and fairness of a prediction can readily be assessed (although\nadditional use-case specific evaluation may also be beneficial). Self-supervised learning models\nwould therefore generally be included within the definition of Predictive DSI. We also note that\nLLMs and other forms of generative AI often use a combination of unsupervised, self-\nsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning, and those that include a component of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupervised learning, including semi-supervised approaches, would likely meet the definition of\nPredictive DSI.\n\nFinally, we understood that models that solely rely on unsupervised learning techniques\nare not widely deployed in healthcare today.<sup>95</sup>\nWe will continue to monitor development of\nmethodologies and applications of unsupervised learning to health-related use cases and may\nconsider future rulemaking for these models as the field develops.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern about consistency, duplication, and\nredundant requirements across various federal programs. Commenters recommended that ONC\ntailor the scope of the proposed term Predictive DSI, and the proposed definition at § 170.102, to\nexclude FDA-authorized AI and machine learning medical devices to mitigate their concerns\nmentioned above. Specifically, one commenter recommended tailoring the Predictive DSI\nrequirements to explicitly exclude tools that are regulated medical devices, to exclude third-party\ntools that qualify as non-device per the statutory exemption for CDS software, and, to apply only\nto technology developed by vendors of certified Health IT Modules to avoid unnecessary\nburdens on regulated device manufacturers. Commenters noted that our proposal for Predictive\nDSI could implicate CDS software that falls within FDA regulated medical devices which may\nhave already been cleared, approved, or otherwise authorized for marketing within the United\nStates.\n\n\nFootnote 95:\nMichael Matheny, et al., Artificial intelligence in health care: the hope, the hype, the promise, the peril,\nWashington, DC: National Academy of Medicine (2019).\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Health Care: Benefits and Challenges of Technologies to Augment Patient Care, (Nov.\n\n2020), https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-7sp.\n\nDeo, Rahul C. \"Machine learning in medicine.\" Circulation 132.20 (2015): 1920-1930.\n\nAmerican Hospital Association. “Surveying the AI Health Care Landscape” 2019.\nhttps://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2019/10/Market_Insights_AI-Landscape.pdf;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by these commenters, which is why we\nworked closely with the FDA on development of our proposals in § 170.315(b)(11). This\ncollaboration included consultation with the FDA on the inclusion or exclusion of devices within\nFDA’s authority in the definition of Predictive DSI. Specifically, we sought alignment with the\nFDA’s recent Clinical Decision Support Guidance for Industry (CDS Guidance), finalized in\nSeptember 2022,<sup>96</sup>\nand we note that our requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) are complementary to\nFDA’s Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions guidance, finalized in\nJune 2023.<sup>97</sup>\nThis high degree of coordination will reduce burden on device manufacturers by\nestablishing the potential that a device manufacturer that also develops a Predictive DSI can\nfulfill two separate federal agency’s requirements with substantially similar or the same\ninformation.\n\nWe noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that our authority to regulate developers of\ncertified health IT under the Program is separate and distinct from other federal agencies’\nregulatory authorities focused on the same or similar entities and technology (88 FR 23811).<sup>98</sup>\nFor example, the safety and effectiveness of a software function, including clinical decision\nsupport or other kinds of decision support interventions, is within the purview of FDA regulatory\n\n\nFootnote 96:\nSee https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-\nsoftware.\n\n\nFootnote 97:\nSee https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/content-premarket-submissions-\ndevice-software-functions.\n\n\nFootnote 98:\nSee U.S. Dept of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4,\n2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-\nand-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English\nproficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, or disability in certain health programs or\nactivities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making).\n\n\n\n\n\n\noversight, if such software functionality meets the definition of a “device.”<sup>99</sup>\nIn the area of\npredictive technology, ONC and FDA support a harmonized and complementary approach,\nindependent of the platform on which the technology operates, in accordance with our existing\nintersecting regulatory oversight. We also noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that questions of\nwhether DSIs enabled by or interfaced with certified health IT are subject to FDA regulations,\nunder the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act, or are used by entities subject to the HIPAA\nRules, are separate and distinct from the question of whether a developer or a particular\ntechnology is subject to regulatory oversight by our Program, to which our proposals pertain (88\nFR 23811).\n\nWe also anticipate that in a scenario where a Device CDS (this is a CDS with software\nfunctions) has been cleared, approved, or otherwise authorized for marketing by the FDA, this\ndevice’s manufacturer will have ready access to much of the information necessary for it to\ncomply with requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) as a developer of certified health IT.\n\nWe appreciate the suggestions to exclude from our definition for Predictive DSI software\nthat are regulated medical devices and to exclude third-party software that qualify as non-device\nsoftware functions per the statutory exemption for CDS software. However, we decline to\ninclude any exclusionary criteria in our definition for Predictive DSI, such as exclusions for\nspecific types of functions or specific types of Predictive DSI developers because the finalized\ndefinition is appropriate to reflect the wide variety of predictive tools that impact and intersect\n\n\nFootnote 99:\nA device, as defined in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, can include an instrument, apparatus, implement,\nmachine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or\naccessory which is, among other criteria, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the\ncure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man.

We also note—as stated above\nand previously in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule—that the FDA and ONC have separate and distinct\nauthorities and regulate for separate and distinct purposes with separate and distinct policy\nobjectives (88 FR 23811). Moreover, we stress the benefits that such alignment and coordination\nbrings to users. Because of our requirements for source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11), users of\nboth CDS with device software functions and Non-Device CDS will have easy access to\nimportant information at the point-of-care.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested we clarify the proposed definition of\nPredictive DSI by providing examples of use cases to show the application of the policy. One\ncommenter recommended that ONC include a clear standard or definition as to which entities the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule applied to, and which applications and tools are in scope for Predictive\nDSIs.\n\n*Response.* We understand commenters’ desire to have ONC assess whether specific\nalgorithms, models, and technologies would meet the definition for Predictive DSI. in § 170.102.\n\nRather than make specific assessments to these commenters’ questions, we provide the following\nexamples of technologies that would likely meet our definition for Predictive DSI and examples\nof technologies that would likely not meet our definition for Predictive DSI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-1. Models that predict whether a given image contains a malignant tumor or that predict\npatient reported pain based on an image, trained based on relationships observed in large\ndata sets often using neural networks, would likely be considered Predictive DSIs.<sup>100</sup>\n-2. Models that pre-selected or highlighted a default order from an order set based on\nrelationships in training data indicating that order was most likely to be selected would\nlikely be considered Predictive DSIs.\n\n-3. Models that predict risk of sepsis, readmission (e.g., LACE+), estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR), or risk of suicide attempt, which have been trained based on\nrelationships observed in large data sets, often using logistic regression and machine\nlearning techniques, and are used to support decision making, would likely be considered\nPredictive DSIs.<sup>101</sup>\n-4. Indices and classification systems developed by expert consensus rather than in empirical\ndata, such as the SOFA index and NYHA Heart Failure classification, would likely not be\nconsidered Predictive DSIs but are likely evidence-based DSI because the score is based\non pre-defined rules and not relationships learned in training data.<sup>102</sup>\n\n\nFootnote 100:\nPierson, Emma, et al. \"An algorithmic approach to reducing unexplained pain disparities in underserved\npopulations.\" Nature Medicine 27.1 (2021): 136-140.

Models that generate clinical notes or draft clinical notes and that were trained based on\nrelationships in large data sets of free text, including large language models, and support\ndecision making about what to document in the clinical note, would likely be considered\nPredictive DSIs.\n\n-6. Models that use natural language processing to route secure messages, which were\ntrained based on the relationship between message contents and the individual who\nresponded to similar messages in the past would likely be considered Predictive DSIs.\n\n-7. Rules-based algorithms for routing secure messages based on the type of message, rather\nthan relationships in training data, would likely not be considered Predictive DSIs.\n\n-8. Growth charts, for instance percentile calculations based on a lambda-mu-sigma\ntransformation of similar age children’s weights, with parameters learned in training data\nfrom a national sample of children, would likely not be considered Predictive DSIs\nbecause the underlying model is based on the distribution of a single variable (e.g.,\nweight) rather than a prediction based on relationships between variables.\n\n-9. A calculation for BMI would likely not be considered a Predictive DSI because the\ncalculation (weight divided by height squared) is not based on relationships in training\ndata.\n\n-10. Patient matching algorithms based on indices of similarities, rather than by relationships\nin training data where an outcome is known, would likely not be Predictive DSIs. Many\nof these technologies are most similar to unsupervised machine learning, which we\ndescribed previously in this section and in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule at 88 FR 23786 as\nout of scope of the current definition of Predictive DSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Optical character recognition, used simply to make a PDF readable or searchable to end\nusers, would likely not be considered Predictive DSI because it does not support\ndecision-making.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were generally mixed on our mention of LLMs and other\ngenerative AI as in scope for the proposed definition of Predictive DSI in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule. Some commenters in support agreed with our assessment that the use of predictive models,\nsuch as AI, invariably present model risk that can lead to patient harm, bias, widening health\ndisparities, discrimination, inefficient resource allocation decisions, or ill-informed clinical\ndecision-making. Commenters stated LLMs and generative AI tools could pose risks if they are\nnot deployed appropriately and monitored carefully and viewed our proposals as a necessary step\nto combat bias and promote equity amid the growing number and increased use of AI tools.\n\nOther commenters expressed concern that LLMs, such as ChatGPT, would be covered in\nthe proposed Predictive DSI definition, noting the definition could sweep in developers of\ngeneral-purpose AI applications that enable or interface with Health IT Modules. One\ncommenter noted that these models are fundamentally different than other Predictive DSI\nmodels, thus including these models in the same category as Predictive DSIs would be an\ninaccurate classification. Commenters were concerned that including LLMs could potentially\nlimit their effective application in non-clinical aspects of healthcare software intended to help\nusers save time and organizations save money and urged ONC to revise the definition so that\ndevelopers of general-purpose AI applications are not obligated by the proposed requirements\nand instead that applications be evaluated within the context of a specific use case.\n\n*Response.* In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we were explicit in describing the scope of our\nPredictive DSI definition to include large language models, or LLMs, and other forms of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngenerative AI that meet the definition of Predictive DSI. We do not believe that LLMs should be\nexcluded from our definition for Predictive DSI if the LLMs are used to support decision-\nmaking, nor do we believe that LLMs are complete “black-boxes” about which no information\ncan be made available to users that would be valuable. We agree with commenters that LLMs\ncould pose a risk if they are not deployed appropriately. We believe that the source attribute- and\nrisk management-related requirements in this rule could help to decrease the likelihood that a\nmodel is inappropriately deployed in a Health IT Module in a way that exacerbates bias or poses\nother risks. We note that we have finalized a fundamentally limited the scope in §\n170.315(b)(11) to focus on transparency capabilities and instances where Predictive DSIs (such\nas LLMs or other generative AI) are supplied by a developer of certified health IT—and not\ngenerally on LLMs or generative AI that may be used in the healthcare ecosystem. If, as part of\nits Health IT Module, a health IT developer supplies an LLM or other generative AI that meets\nthe definition of Predictive DSI, the finalized policy in § 170.315(b)(11) requires the health IT\ndeveloper’s Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11) to enable access to complete and up-\nto-date plain language descriptions of source attribute information related to that Predictive DSI.\n\nOur finalized policy also requires Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) to, at a\nminimum, have the technical capability for users and other parties to populate the source\nattributes listed in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) themselves. We agree with commenters that LLMs\nshould be evaluated within the context of specific use cases and believe that the scope of this\nfinal rule will not limit the effective application of LLMs.\n\nRegarding commenters’ concerns about LLMs being fundamentally different and\nrequiring different kinds of source attributes that are more fit for transparency purposes, we note\nthat our requirements for source attributes represent a minimum “floor,” and developers of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertified health IT are encouraged to provide additional source attributes to users as appropriate.\n\nWe also describe in more detail in subsequent responses that we have finalized a requirement for\nHealth IT Modules to enable a limited set of identified users to record, change, and access\nadditional source attribute information not specified in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) of this final rule.\n\nThis will enable users to identify source attributes and record, change, and access those source\nattributes based on local validation and enable users to access emerging transparency measures\nspecific to emerging Predictive DSI types, such as those based on LLMs.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern with the proposed definition including the\nterm “derive relationships from training or example data,” stating that it is overly broad and\nunclear as to what would be considered in scope, such as whether general system improvements\nlearned from user behavior would fall into this definition. The commenter also expressed\nconcern with our preamble description that “Predictive models are those that have ‘learned’\nrelationships from a training or historic data source, generally using some form of statistical or\nmachine learning approach” stating that it is unclear whether commonly used predictions (e.g.,\nLACE+ for readmission or a SOFA score)<sup>103</sup>\nare included in the definition of Predictive DSI.\n\nThe commenter requested that the definition should be clarified to focus only on models that are\ngenerated from machine learning techniques and for the types of clinical predictions that are not\ncommonly used in medical practice and clarified to focus on a prediction of an unknown or\nfuture clinical event.\n\n\nFootnote 103:\nVincent, J -L., et al. \"The SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score to describe organ\ndysfunction/failure: On behalf of the Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of\nIntensive Care Medicine (see contributors to the project in the appendix).\" (1996): 707-710.\nvan Walraven, Carl, Jenna Wong, and Alan J. Forster. \"LACE+ index: extension of a validated index to predict early\ndeath or urgent readmission after hospital discharge using administrative data.\" Open Medicine 6.3 (2012): e80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and the questions. We note that “derive\nrelationships from training data” is only a part of the overall definition we have finalized. If a\ntechnology is used to make “general system improvements” based on training data that consists\nof “user behavior,” it may meet the definition of a Predictive DSI in § 170.102 if it derived\nrelationships (for instance, correlations) from that training data and then produced an output that\nresults in prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis used to support\ndecision-making. “General system improvements” based on other analysis, such as tracking the\ntime required to perform a task, would likely not meet the definition because that technology\ndoes not “derive relationships.” If “general system improvements learned from user behavior,”\nwere the outputs of the technology or the effect of the technology, but that output was not used to\nsupport decision-making or was not a prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation or\nanalysis, then this technology likely would not meet our finalized definition.\n\nWe noted above in examples that the LACE+ model for readmission would likely meet\nthe definition of Predictive DSI at § 170.102 and because the SOFA score was defined by expert\nconsensus, rather than training data, this would not likely meet the definition of Predictive DSI at\n§ 170.102. We note that in our finalized definition, we have removed “or example” and now only\nrefer to “training data,” for clarity and because we do not believe there is an appreciable or\nimpactful difference between training and example data. We respectfully decline to include any\nexclusionary criteria in our definition for Predictive DSI, including exclusions for specific types\nof functions or specific types of Predictive DSI developers.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that we revise the definition to take a\ntiered approach to DSI requirements based on the type and level of meaningful risk to patients\nassociated with the AI systems, suggesting that we should focus on “high-risk” DSIs, remarking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat it would help alleviate public confusion and suggesting that this approach would better meet\nthe intent of addressing the risks associated with DSI. One commenter recommended that\nPredictive DSI should not apply to consumer-facing devices and low risk tools, noting that the\npublic interest would not be served by imposing regulatory compliance obligations on low-risk\nPredictive DSI use cases – even when applied in a clinical context. For example, Predictive DSI\ntools used for non-clinical purposes (e.g., EHR integrations for administrative notes and billing)\ndo not present the sorts of risks that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule is intended to address. Along with\nclarifying that low-risk Predictive DSI tools are exempt, the commenter suggested that ONC\nshould also issue guidance clarifying the types of proposed uses that are considered “low-risk.”\n\n*Response.* We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that our definition is not tied to the level\nof risk (88 FR 23785), and we decline to focus on “high-risk” DSIs. Doing so would diverge\nfrom established approaches within the CDS criterion. The certification criterion for CDS was\nestablished to ensure that Health IT Modules certified to the criterion support broad categories of\nCDS, including by making information about the CDS available for user review, while being\nagnostic toward the intended use of the CDS beyond drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction\nchecks (88 FR 23774). We did not propose to alter that construct in our proposals, and we\nrespectfully decline to do so in this final rule. We do not agree with commenters that a focus on\n“high-risk” DSIs would alleviate public confusion because defining and determining levels of\nrisk for Predictive DSIs that, in some cases indirectly, impact the healthcare of millions of\nindividuals is complex and requires consideration of numerous factors. Instead, the information\nrequired for Predictive DSI will be beneficial for all Predictive DSI supplied by developers of\ncertified health IT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also decline to include any exclusionary criteria in our definition for Predictive DSI,\nincluding exclusions for specific types of functions, such as consumer-facing tools or other “low\nrisk” tools, or for specific types of Predictive DSI developers. We note that non-clinical\nPredictive DSIs and clinical Predictive DSIs that may be categorized as of relatively low risk\nhave consequences for and impact the care individuals receive, and as we have noted elsewhere,\ndemonstrably negative impacts beyond clinical safety have been well-documented in various\nstudies and academic literature in recent years.<sup>104</sup>\nTogether, we believe these factors warrant a\nbroad and inclusive definition for Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters were concerned that due to the breadth of the definition,\nnon-certified health IT would be included in the definition and believed the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\nshould be limited to software that an EHR vendor submits for certification under the Program,\nnoting that ONC’s authority under the Program is limited to oversight of certified Health IT\nModules and developers of certified health IT.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge that the definition of Predictive DSI itself may have broad\napplicability. As part of 45 CFR part 170, any application of the definition (and the related\nrequirements in § 170.315(b)(11)) is limited to certified Health IT Modules and developers who\ndevelop them. We note that our definition does not depend on or reference the certification status\n\n\nFootnote 104:\nSamorani M., Harris S. L., Blount L.

As described\nelsewhere in the rule, and to address these and related commenters’ concerns, we have focused\nthe scope of Predictive DSIs to which our regulatory requirements apply to those supplied by the\ndeveloper of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module. We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule that our authority to regulate developers of certified health IT and their Health IT Modules,\nensuring that both conform to technical standards, certification criteria, implementation\nspecifications, and adherence to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, is\nseparate and distinct from other federal agencies’ authorities to regulate for separate and distinct\npurposes with separate and distinct policy objectives that may be focused on the same or similar\nentities and technology (88 FR 23809–23810), that may pertain to the use of Predictive DSIs and\ntechnology, including AI and machine learning, in health and human services.<sup>105</sup>\nOutside of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, multiple federal agencies, within their unique\nauthorities, are exploring policies pertaining AI and machine learning (88 FR 23810).<sup>106</sup>\n\n\nFootnote 105:\nSee, e.g., See U.S. Dept of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4,\n2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-\nand-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English\nproficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, or disability in certain health programs or\nactivities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making).\n\nCMS Medicare Advantage Program Final Rule (April 2023),\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/12/2023-07115/medicare-program-contract-year-2024-policy-\nand-technical-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-program (The rule clarified coverage criteria for basic benefits\nand the use of prior authorization, added continuity of care requirements, and required an annual review of\nutilization management tools).\n\n\nFootnote 106:\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has addressed AI repeatedly in its work through a combination of law\nenforcement, business education and policy initiatives.

For example,\none commenter recommended ONC use public definitions of AI and include a neural net\ncomponent for an adopted definition of Predictive DSI. Another commenter suggested ONC\nnarrow the definition of Predictive DSI to focus on outputs that are recommendations and to\nlimit the definition by removing the proposed “. . . prediction, classification, evaluation or\nanalysis” section of the proposed definition. One commenter urged ONC to survey the\ndefinitions of healthcare AI currently in use, including the American Medical Association\nCurrent Procedural Terminology (CPT®) Appendix S: AI taxonomy for medical services and\nprocedures because it outlines the range of AI tools from those performing purely assistive\nfunctions to fully autonomous technologies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments, and we are aware of the American Medical\nAssociation Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) Appendix S: AI taxonomy for medical\nservices and procedures. We think this taxonomy has value but decline to include specific\npurposes or kinds of machine learning in our Predictive DSI definition. We believe such\nconstraints may unintentionally exclude relevant technology as it evolves and is applied to more\nuse cases, humans interact with technology in more diverse ways, and societal views on the line\ndont-say-ftc-workshop-voice-cloning-technologies; https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/privacycon-\n2021; https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/eventscalendar/privacycon-2020; https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-\ncalendar/ftc-hearing-7-competition-consumerprotection-21st-century; https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-\ncalendar/2017/03/fintech-forum-blockchainartificial-intelligence; and https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-\ncalendar/2011/12/face-facts-forum-facialrecognition-technology.The Commission has issued an advanced notice of\nproposed rulemaking that poses questions about the harms to consumers that may result from commercial\nsurveillance, including as related to algorithmic decision making. See FTC, Advance Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking regarding Commercial Surveillance and Data Security (August 11, 2022), https://www.ftc.gov/legal-\nlibrary/browse/federal-register-notices/commercial-surveillance-data-security-rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween assistive and autonomous technologies shift. We, again, decline to modify our definition\nto exclude specific use cases, purpose of uses or intended uses and decline to modify our\ndefinition to include specific types of algorithms, such as neural networks, because we suspect\nthe relevant algorithms will similarly evolve over time. We also decline to narrow the definition\nto exclude prediction, classification, evaluation and analysis because we believe that each of\nthese types of output and use are of relevance in healthcare and can result from fundamentally\nsimilar technologies.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed definition included\nand implicated algorithms that are not directly tied to clinical workflows or capture large areas of\nsoftware solutions used in certified EHR systems or types of interventions that are not conducive\nto source attributes or feedback gathering, specifically noting concerns with gathering feedback\nfrom passive clinical support. One commenter noted that the proposed definition could be\ninterpreted to classify any list of patients, information form, or a comparison against a population\naverage as Predictive DSI and recommended that ONC should remove the overly broad\nexamples or clarify that the definition applies only when the predictive modifier applies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments, and we acknowledge that our discussion\nregarding the term “intervention,” at 88 FR 23786, which included mention of “alerts, order sets,\nflowsheets, dashboards, patient lists, documentation forms, relevant data presentations, protocol\nor pathway support, reference information or guidance, and reminder messages,” was\nimperfectly placed. It was not our intention to intimate that each of these kinds of\n“interventions,” would always fall under the Predictive DSI definition but that each kind of\nintervention could be a Predictive DSI if they are driven by algorithms or models that derive\nrelationships from training data and then produce an output that results in prediction,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclassification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. We believe that source attributes can be\nprovided for a Predictive DSI that is used in operations, scheduling, payment, and other\nworkflows and that there is value in doing so, for instance, for medical coders to evaluate the\nrelevance of codes suggested by a Predictive DSI. We note that feedback gathering is limited to\nevidence-based decision support interventions, which have a more limited scope. We believe that\nour finalized definition and associated examples provide interested parties with better clarity on\ntechnology within the definition’s scope.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed definition does not\nadequately distinguish Predictive DSI from evidence-based DSI, which they believed is also\ndefined too broadly. Commenters provided examples they believed should be excluded from the\ndefinition, such as passive decision support, reminders for preventative care, industry standard\ngrowth charts, well established reference ranges, default selections in the system, suggested word\ncompletions when typing, or rules-based decision support. Several commenters recommended\nthat DSIs should be limited to predictive, evidence-based medicine support interventions\nimpacting clinical choice, and solutions supporting fact-based administrative functions, such as\nscheduling appointments or bed availability, should be carved out.\n\n*Response.* We have provided a set of examples, discussed above, along with our finalized\ndefinition in § 170.102 of Predictive DSI as meaning technology that supports decision-making\nbased on algorithms or models that derive relationships from training data and then produce an\noutput that results in prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. We also\nhave clarified the scope of evidence-based DSIs, for purposes of requirements in §\n170.315(b)(11), as being limited to only those DSIs that are actively presented to users in clinical\nworkflow to enhance, inform, or influence decision-making related to the care a patient receives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand that do not meet the definition for Predictive DSI at § 170.102. We decline to further limit\nthe scope of the Predictive DSI definition, especially for administrative functions, which would\nlikely benefit from the transparency our requirements would provide. We note that even\nappointment scheduling and block scheduling predictive models have been demonstrated to be of\ninsufficient quality, causing harm to patients.<sup>107</sup>\nWe believe that greater transparency on the\nquality of these models could have avoided harm to patients by users interpreting predictions\nmore judiciously or choosing not to use the model, or by motivating developers to retrain the\nmodels.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that ONC limit the definition to exclude\nhealth care providers that have developed their own tools for internal use regardless of whether\nthey are enabled by or interface with the EHR the provider uses from the proposed regulatory\nrequirements. Commenters remarked that the distinction between health care providers and EHR\nvendors offering DSI services through certified health IT products is important as providers have\ngreater understanding and experience with self-developed DSI tools they use internally and\nshould not be subject to the same requirements as vendors offering DSI tools in certified health\nIT products for commercial use.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. With regards to the definition of Predictive DSI,\nwe did not propose and have not finalized a definition that is dependent on the entity or party\ndeveloping the Predictive DSI. In other words, “who develops” a Predictive DSI is separate and\ndistinct from how we define what a Predictive DSI is for the purpose of this regulation. Along\n\n\nFootnote 107:\nSamorani M., Harris S. L., Blount L. G., et al (2021) Overbooked and Overlooked: Machine Learning and Racial\nBias in Medical Appointment Scheduling. Manufacturing & Service Operations Management 24(6):2825-2842.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.0999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthose lines, while health care providers may develop Predictive DSIs (as we have defined), we\nhave not excluded those provider-authored Predictive DSIs from meeting the regulatory\ndefinition. However, it is important for commenters to keep in mind that the definition is only\none part of the Program’s policy approach to Predictive DSIs. In response to comments that\nappeared to conflate “the who” and “the what” with respect to the definition, we clarify that a\nhealth care provider who self-develops a tool that meets our definition of Predictive DSI is not\nsubject to the requirements in § 170.315(b)(11). We believe that ‘self-developed’ tools, which\nmay be developed by informaticians in a health system and then applied to individual patients by\nclinical users or others without knowledge of the development or evaluation process could\nbenefit from the inclusion of transparency information guiding their use. And our finalized\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) would result in health care providers being equipped\nwith the technological capabilities to deliver such transparency through Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11). We describe requirements further below that Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11) must support the technical capability for source attribute\ninformation to be accessed and modified by users as well as the limited contexts in which\ndevelopers of certified health IT are required to populate those attributes. Specifically, as already\nnoted, we have limited the scope of our transparency requirements for source attribute\ninformation to apply to Predictive DSIs that are supplied by the health IT developer as part of its\nHealth IT Module.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter urged ONC to revise the proposed definition of Predictive\nDSI in a manner that specifically excludes laboratory results reported to a health care provider\nvia a Health IT Module when such laboratory results are derived using an algorithm. The\ncommenter noted their concern that the broad definition of Predictive DSI could cause Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers to believe that a laboratory offering a test whose result is derived using an algorithm,\nand which is reported via an interfaced laboratory information system (LIS), must provide source\nattribute information about the test. The commenter also noted instrumentation result generation\nshould not be considered covered by this DSI intervention rule, because laboratories’\ninstrumentation remains under the auspices of standards established by the College of American\nPathologists (CAP) and CLIA. One commenter expressly requested that we adopt an exception\nfor radiologists in implementing DSI because they stated that DSI is not useful to that specialty\nand thus we should exempt them until the CMS Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) program is\navailable.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. As noted above, we respectfully decline to\ninclude any exclusionary criteria in our definition for Predictive DSI, including exclusions for\nspecific types of organizations that develop the Predictive DSI, exclusions for specific types of\ntechnology that may be considered a Predictive DSI, and exclusions for organizations or\ntechnology that may be subject to other federal requirements and authorities, like the Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendments regulations,<sup>108</sup>\nthe CMS Appropriate Use Criteria\nprogram,<sup>109</sup>\nor Medicare Advantage Program regulations related to utilization management.<sup>110</sup>\nRelated to the lab example provided by the commenter, and reflective of our final policy, this\n\n\nFootnote 108:\nCLIA regulations include federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens for\nhealth assessment for to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease.

For more information about the program, see https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/appropriate-\nuse-criteria-program.\n\n\nFootnote 110:\nSee, e.g., CMS Medicare Advantage Program Final Rule (April 2023),\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/12/2023-07115/medicare-program-contract-year-2024-policy-\nand-technical-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-program (clarified coverage criteria for basic benefits and the use\nof prior authorization, added continuity of care requirements, and required an annual review of utilization\nmanagement tools).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexample would generally not be within the scope of a developer of certified IT’s accountability,\nunless the developer of certified health IT specifically supplied the laboratory Predictive DSI as\npart of its Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11). As indicated by the comment, the\ncertified health IT would be receiving a lab result for an outside entity using instrumentation\nseparate and distinct (not included as a part of the developer’s certified health IT), even if that\nresult was arrived at by the laboratory using a Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on whether patient matching\nalgorithms are subject to the Predictive DSI definition, and thus included in the risk management\nand reporting requirements. The commenter was supportive of including patient matching\nalgorithms under the proposed definition given that the models use example data to determine\naccuracy prior to implementation and produce an output stating which patient it believes matches\nto which record given the data it is presented with. The commenter observed that by being able\nto understand the matching algorithms themselves, the healthcare continuum can better react and\nhone its data capture practices ensuring the algorithms receive the best quality data to guarantee\nthe best possible match given the algorithms’ determinations. Relatedly, a second commenter\nrequested clarification on whether an algorithm that assigns similarity scores without labels is\nnot a Predictive DSI.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and refer readers to our finalized definition for\nPredictive DSI as technology that supports decision-making based on algorithms or models that\nderive relationships from training data and then produces an output that results in prediction,\nclassification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. We are aware of a variety of methods to\nperform patient matching, including identifying whether specific fields are exact matches, or\nwhether certain strings of text contain a high proportion of matching characters, and not all of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthem are based in relationships derived from training data.<sup>111</sup>\nSuch patient matching methods\nwould likely not be considered Predictive DSI if they were not based on relationships derived\nfrom training data. We further note that the exclusion of unsupervised machine learning\napproaches, which generally do not predict an unknown value but rather identify the similarity or\ncloseness of data, described at 88 FR 23786, is likely to apply to some patient matching\nalgorithms, which would also likely not be considered Predictive DSI. That same clarification\nwould apply to other algorithms that generate a similarity or closeness score without labeled\ntraining data (for instance, patient phenotyping or search recommendations based on the\nsimilarity between search strings and document contents), which would likely not be considered\nPredictive DSI. Other patient matching algorithms, especially those leveraging a supervised\nlearning approach, are likely to meet the definition of a Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* A different commenter was concerned with the proposed definition of\nPredictive DSI including the term “algorithm” because it suggested a more inclusive set of health\nIT than they believed was intended by legislative and regulatory scope, which they stated would\ncreate confusion in the marketplace. The commenter recommended refining DSI’s definition by\nremoving “algorithms” to limit scope specifically to decision support driven by models using\nexample data. Some commenters recommended ONC shift the criterion back to a specific focus\non clinical DSIs as an initial starting point for the revised criterion.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and the concern. Our definition for Predictive DSI\nincludes technology that supports decision-making based on both models and algorithms that\nderive relationships from training data and then produce an output that results in prediction,\n\n\nFootnote 111:\nGovernment Accountability Office. Health Information Technology: Approaches and Challenges to\nElectronically Matching Patients’ Records across Providers. Jan 15, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclassification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. We understand that not all interested\nparties share the same conception of how an algorithm is related to a model or vice versa.\n\nRegardless, the existence of an algorithm in or as part of a technology is not, alone,\ndeterminative in meeting our definition for Predictive DSI. In addition to including an algorithm,\na technology must also support decision-making based on the algorithm and that algorithm must\nderive, or learn, relationships from training data and then produce an output that results in\nprediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis. We also decline to limit the\nscope of our definition to focus on clinical uses as previously discussed in this section.\n\nAttestation for Predictive Decision Support Interventions\nIn proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A), at 88 FR 23786, we proposed that developers of\ncertified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) attest “yes” or “no” to\nwhether their Health IT Module enables or interfaces with Predictive DSIs based on any of the\ndata expressed in the standards in § 170.213. This attestation requirement would have the effect\nof permitting developers of certified health IT to certify to § 170.315(b)(11) without requiring\ntheir Health IT Modules to enable or interface with Predictive DSIs. However, for those\ndevelopers of certified health IT that attest “yes” as described in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A), we\ndescribed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule additional applicable requirements related to source\nattributes and IRM practices (88 FR 23786).\n\nWe clarified that “enables” means that the developer of certified health IT has the\ntechnical capability to support a predictive model or DSI within the developer’s Health IT\nModule. We clarified that applications developed by other parties and self-developed\napplications that are used within or as a part of a Health IT Module would mean that the Health\nIT Module is considered to “enable” Predictive DSIs. We provided an example, stating that if the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncalculations or processing for a Predictive DSI occur within the Health IT Module, either\nthrough a standalone application developed by an other party<sup>112</sup>\nor an application self-developed\nby a developer of certified health IT for use within a Health IT Module, we would consider this\n“enabling.” In contrast, we clarified that “interfaces with” means that the Health IT Module\nfacilitates either (1) the launch of a predictive model or DSI or (2) the delivery of a predictive\nmodel or DSI output(s) to users when such a predictive model or DSI resides outside of the\nHealth IT Module and provided examples. We noted that some organizations may use USCDI\ndata exported or sourced from a certified Health IT Module to develop data-driven advanced\nanalytics leveraging predictive models or technologies to provide insights for healthcare. We\nalso noted that in such circumstances, our proposed requirements would only apply if the output\nof the predictive model subsequently interfaced with a Health IT Module. The proposed\nrequirement would not establish requirements for predictive technologies that are not enabled or\ndo not interface with a Health IT Module.\n\nFinally, we clarified that other parties includes any party that develops a DSI, a model, or\nan algorithm that is used by a DSI and is not a developer of certified health IT (88 FR 23796).\n\nWe said these other parties could include, but are not limited to: a customer of the developer of\ncertified health IT, such as an individual health care provider, provider group, hospital, health\nsystem, academic medical center, or integrated delivery network; a third-party software\ndeveloper, such as those that publish or sell medical content or literature used by a DSI; or\n\n\nFootnote 112:\nPlease note that “other party” is a term of art we described at 88 FR 23796. In this final rule, we have italicized\nother party and other parties to assist readers’ understanding that we are using this term of art and not misspelling\n“another.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresearchers and data scientists, such as those who develop a model or algorithm that is used by a\nDSI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were generally supportive of the proposal to enable Health IT\nModules to be certified to § 170.315(b)(11) without the health IT developer being obligated to\nprovide Predictive DSIs to their customers by having developers of certified health IT attest\n“yes” or “no” to whether their Health IT Module enables or interfaces with Predictive DSIs\nbased on any of the data expressed in the standards in § 170.213. Commenters requested that we\nreflect that health IT developers would not be compelled to provide (or author) Predictive DSIs\ndue to the attestation statements adopted in this provision.\n\nNotwithstanding the general support, many commenters did not support the “enables or\ninterfaces with,” construct associated with the attestation proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A).\n\nMany commenters noted that the “enables or interfaces with,” scope was a vague, ambiguous,\nand problematic phrase when applied to the proposed definition for Predictive DSI. Commenters,\nspecifically health IT developers, were concerned that it would be hard to comply with the\n“enables or interfaces with” scope on which conditional requirements for source attributes and\nIRM practice requirements would rely. Commenters requested that we further define and narrow\nthe scope of “enables or interfaces with,” and commenters stated that ONC should clearly define\nthe scope of activities or technologies to which the related requirements for source attributes and\nIRM practices apply. For example, some commenters suggested that source attribute and IRM\npractice requirements should only apply in specific situations, such as when entities have\ncontracts specifically covering the enablement and use of such technologies. Commenters also\nexpressed substantive concerns that the phrase “enables or interfaces with” would require health\nIT developers to meet the transparency requirements for all third-party apps that customers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nutilize via § 170.315(g)(10) technology. They also stated that it would be difficult for developers\nto know when these third-party apps “enable or interfaced with” their Health IT Module and\ndifficult to require third parties to provide source attributes information, particularly when there\nis no contractual relationship between the health IT developer and those third parties.\n\nTaken together and as we looked at the substance of comments comprehensively, we\nnoticed that commenters described circumstances that would otherwise make the original intent\nbehind the attestation proposal moot. Instead of enabling a health IT developer that did not\nprovide or author Predictive DSIs to meet the attestation for proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(v) by\nattesting “no” regarding their support for Predictive DSIs, many developers appeared to convey\nthat they would need to attest “yes” because of their understanding of the proposed scope for\n“enable or interface with.” This was because they interpreted our proposal for “enable or\ninterface with” to include their accountability for customer actions associated with Predictive\nDSIs, which would not necessarily be known at the time of certification and, as a result, the\ndeveloper of certified health IT would have to err on the side of expecting that one of their\ncustomers would enable or interface their Health IT Module with a Predictive DSI. In short, we\nunderstood from commenter feedback that developers of certified health IT could not reasonably\nvalidate whether customers were using Health IT Modules to enable or interface with Predictive\nDSIs.\n\nOn the whole, commenters contended that our proposal included ambiguities and\nchallenges related to implementation, knowledge, and ongoing compliance. The latter of which\nwould be the most difficult for developers of certified health IT based on what we had proposed.\n\nFor example, if under our proposal, a developer had attested “no” and then months later a single\ncustomer had “enabled or interfaced with” an other party Predictive DSI with the developer’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth IT Module (certified to § 170.315(b)(11)), it was unclear whether the developer would\nneed to reengage its ONC-ACB to change its certificate for § 170.315(b)(11) and attest “yes” and\ntake on the additional compliance requirements. Comments also made clear that we should seek\nto minimize and separate how independent customer actions and decisions associated with\nPredictive DSIs interplay with conditional compliance requirements for developers of certified\nhealth IT under the Program.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback on the attestation proposal, its\nconstruction within the criterion at § 170.315(b)(11), and how to make it more implementable. In\nsummary, the intent behind the proposed attestation statement and its associated framing was to\nestablish a conditional approach whereby developers of certified health IT certifying to §\n170.315(b)(11) would still be able to get certified to § 170.315(b)(11) even if their Health IT\nModule did not enable or interface with a Predictive DSI. We had hoped that this would relieve\nspecific regulatory burdens for developers of certified health IT that had no intention to enable or\ninterface with a Predictive DSI. However, as commenters pointed out, because of the broad\nscope of “enable or interfaced with” even those developers that could have plausibly attested\n“no” may still have felt it necessary to attest “yes” when seeking certification. Despite not\nknowing of customers using Health IT Modules to enable or interface with a Predictive DSI,\nthese developers of certified health IT would need to attest “yes” as soon as single customer used\ntheir certified Health IT Module to enable or interface with a Predictive DSI. We interpreted\nthese developer compliance concerns, about whether they would know if a customer had enabled\nor interfaced a Predictive DSI with their Health IT Module, as an important implementation issue\nand necessary to address as part of this final rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn consideration of these and similar comments, we have not adopted the attestation\nstatement we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(v). Given the circumstances and concerns described\nby commenters, we have concluded that accurate attestations, relieved burden, and clear (initial\nand ongoing) compliance would not have been accomplished as proposed. Rather than adopt an\nattestation statement, we have finalized minimal, uniform requirements for all Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) while also maintaining a construction that enables a\ndeveloper of certified health IT to certify a Health IT Module to § 170.315(b)(11) without being\nobligated to author, develop, or otherwise directly provide Predictive DSIs to their customers. In\nresponse to comments, we believe this synthesized approach provides developers of certified\nhealth IT with clear policy and layered compliance requirements that are specifically within the\nscope of the Program and that of the developer’s control (i.e., a customer’s action will not create\nany corresponding compliance impact on a developer’s § 170.315(b)(11) compliance).\n\nAs described throughout this section, we have removed “enabled or interfaced with” and\nreplaced it with “supplied by.” The final rule’s scope places the knowledge, decision, and\nongoing compliance associated with including a Predictive DSI solely within the control of a\ndeveloper of certified health IT. While the use of “supplied by” is a different configuration nexus\nthan the proposed attestation statement that used “enables or interfaces with,” this approach\nsimilarly addresses our intent to only apply additional Predictive DSI related stewardship\nresponsibilities to health IT developers who supply Predictive DSIs as part of their Health IT\nModule. The paragraphs that follow illustrate by way of final certification criterion requirements\nsome of the changes we have made in response to comments associated with the certification\ncriterion’s focus on Predictive DSI’s “supplied by” the health IT developer and the\ncorresponding effect of not finalizing the attestation. We believe the finalized requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovide much more certainty for health IT developers while still addressing our overall policy\ngoal for § 170.315(b)(11)—to provide as part of the Program greater transparency associated\nwith DSIs, particularly Predictive DSIs and their ability to be FAVES.\n\nFirst, we have adopted requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii), described previously in this\nfinal rule, that enables a limited set of identified users to select (i.e., activate) electronic DSIs that\nare evidence-based in (b)(11)(iii)(A) and predictive in (b)(11)(iii)(B). We believe that this\nuniform requirement to enable the selection of a Predictive DSI represents a minimal level of\neffort beyond, and a slight modification to, what developers of certified health IT would have\nhad to do if we had finalized the “no,” attestation. Such developers of certified health IT would\nhave had to enable selection of evidence-based DSIs and supported source attribute fields for\nevidence-based DSIs. As stated previously, enabling the selection of Predictive DSIs would\nlikely be operationalized through the same technical means as enabling selection of an evidence-\nbased DSI. Additionally, and in acknowledgement of our proposed rule discussion that\nrequirements for DSI configuration in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii) applied to both evidence-based DSIs\nand Predictive DSIs (88 FR 23783), we believe that Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) would have baseline expectations to support both user configuration of Predictive\nDSIs and user selection of Predictive DSIs. Finally, we believe that software development of\nfields to support source attributes (in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)) for Predictive DSIs would likely\nnot be substantially more burdensome than the work necessary to develop fields to support\nevidence-based DSI source attributes (in § 170.315(b)(11)(A)).\n\nSecond, the finalization of § 170.315(b)(11) without an attestation statement but with\nuniform requirements for users to configure and have the technical capability to select both\nevidence-based and Predictive DSIs achieves a policy goal to ensure that users have equal\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntechnical capabilities to access, record, and change Predictive DSI source attributes in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v)(B) for Predictive DSIs they self-develop and for Predictive DSIs they\npurchase from other parties, in addition to potential Predictive DSIs supplied by the users’\ndeveloper of certified health IT. Under the proposed attestation statement with the enables or\ninterfaces with configuration nexus, users of Health IT Modules that attested “no,” would have\ntechnical challenges to use self-developed or other party-developed Predictive DSIs. This is\nbecause Predictive DSI-related source attribute fields (proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C)) and\nPredictive DSI-related capabilities to author and revise source attributes (proposed in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi)(E)) would not have been required for those “no attestation” Health IT\nModules to support. We believe that as the market for Predictive DSIs grows, equivalent\ntechnical capabilities for users to access, record, and change source attributes in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv) across Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) will be vital to\npromote Predictive DSIs that are FAVES.\n\nThird, we have narrowed the focus of requirements related to providing IRM practices\ninformation on Predictive DSIs to those that are “supplied by the health IT developer as part of\nits Health IT Module.” This approach reduces the overall scope of technologies subject to final\nrequirements in § 170.315(b)(11) while keeping the intent of the attestation statement we\nproposed. For instance, our finalized policy in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) requires that for Predictive\nDSIs supplied by the developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module the\ndeveloper would have to address specific IRM practices associated with each Predictive DSI it\nsupplies. As noted and similar to our intent with the “no” attestation proposal, based on the\nrevised scope in this final rule, if a health IT developer does not supply any Predictive DSIs it\nwill still be able to comply with § 170.315(b)(11) and will not have to meet, for example, IRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\npractice requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) because the health IT developer does not supply\nany Predictive DSIs as part of its Health IT Module. We note, however, if after certification to §\n170.315(b)(11), a developer does begin to supply Predictive DSIs as part of its certified Health\nIT Module, it would need to comply with all applicable requirements in § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nWe interpret “supplied by” to include interventions authored or developed by the health\nIT developer as well as interventions authored or developed by an other party that the health IT\ndeveloper includes as part of its Health IT Module, such as stated in the comments “when\nentities have contracts specifically covering the enablement and use of such technologies.” The\nconcept of “supplied by” means that the developer of certified health IT has taken on\nstewardship and accountability for that Predictive DSI for the purposes of the Health IT Module.\n\nWe interpret “as part of its Health IT Module” to mean that the developer of certified health IT\nhas explicitly offered or provided its customers the technical capability to use or support a\nPredictive DSI, regardless of whether the Predictive DSI was developed by the developer of\ncertified health IT or by an other party.\n\nBy way of example, “supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT\nModule” would include the implementation of a publicly available predictive model, like\nLACE+,<sup>113</sup>\nif a developer of certified health IT includes this Predictive DSI as part of its product\nand it is part of what the developer offers its customers. As another example, “supplied by the\nhealth IT developer as part of its Health IT Module” would include incorporation of an other\n\n\nFootnote 113:\nvan Walraven, Carl, Jenna Wong, and Alan J. Forster. \"LACE+ index: extension of a validated index to predict\nearly death or urgent readmission after hospital discharge using administrative data.\" Open Medicine 6.3 (2012):\ne80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparty’s LLM, or other generative AI, that meets the definition of Predictive DSI and is part of\nwhat the developer offers its customers.\n\nFrom a conformance perspective, “supplied by the health IT developer as part of its\nHealth IT Module” means that developers of certified health IT are not accountable for\npopulating source attribute information for, or applying IRM practices, to Predictive DSIs in\ninstances where their customers choose to deploy a self-developed Predictive DSI or an other\nparty-developed Predictive DSI for use within their certified health IT. This is true even if the\ncustomer leverages data from the developer of certified health IT’s Health IT Module and even if\nthe output from an other party’s Predictive DSI is delivered to or through a Health IT Module\ninto a customer’s clinical workflow.\n\nWe reiterate that other party means any party that develops a DSI, a model, or an\nalgorithm that is used by a DSI, and is not the developer of certified health IT or a subsidiary of\nthe developer of certified health IT. This is consistent with our discussion in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule on 88 FR 23796.<sup>114</sup>\nThis description of other party in this final rule preamble specifically\nexcludes a subsidiary of a developer of certified health IT. We intend for purposes of our\nrequirements in § 170.315(b)(11) that a subsidiary of a developer of certified health IT that\ndevelops a Predictive DSI would be considered the same as if it were the developer of certified\nhealth IT, subjecting Predictive DSIs developed by a subsidiary to the same requirements as a\nPredictive DSI supplied by a developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module.\n\n\nFootnote 114:\nAs noted in HTI-1 Proposed Rule, Other parties can include, but are not limited to: a customer of the developer\nof certified health IT, such as an individual health care provider, provider group, hospital, health system, academic\nmedical center, or integrated delivery network; a third-party software developer, such as those that publish or sell\nmedical content or literature used by a DSI; or researchers and data scientists, such as those who develop a model or\nalgorithm that is used by a DSI (88 FR 23796).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must support the technical\ncapability for other party source attribute information to be entered into the Health IT Module’s\nsource attribute fields, per requirements elaborated below for final § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B). We\nnote that if a developer of certified health IT would like to include a capability for other parties\nto record source attributes into a Health IT Module in a way that shields the developer of\ncertified health IT from having access to the other party source attributes, they may do so.\n\nHowever, we reiterate that developers of certified health IT are not required to receive, acquire,\nor otherwise obtain source attribute information for an other party’s Predictive DSI unless such\nPredictive DSI is supplied by the developer of certified health IT as part of its Health IT Module.\n\nFinally, and in consideration of comments received and the scope reductions we have\nmade to this final certification criterion, we determined that a supportive Maintenance of\nCertification requirement as part of the Assurances Condition of Certification in 45 CFR\n170.402(b) was necessary to fully implement our policy objectives and proposals. We have\nincluded in this final rule an Assurances Maintenance of Certification requirement that reinforces\na certified health IT developer’s ongoing responsibility in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1) to enable\nuser access to updated descriptions of source attribute information at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)\nand (B), to review and update as necessary IRM practices that must be applied for each\nPredictive DSI the health IT developer supplies as part of its Health IT Module in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi), and to ensure the ongoing public accessibility of updated summary IRM\npractice information as submitted to their ONC-ACB via hyperlink in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi).\n\nThis Maintenance of Certification requirement is a § 170.315(b)(11)-specific instantiation\nof general Program requirements described in § 170.402(a) as well as an adaptation of what we\nproposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D), which proposed to establish an “annual and, as necessary,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdate” requirement for developers with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) (88 FR\n23805). In consideration of comments received on § 170.315(b)(11) as a whole and the\ncorresponding changes we made to the final certification criterion to focus on Health IT Module\ncapabilities, it became clear that the ongoing transparency of source attribute and IRM practices\nassociated with § 170.315(b)(11) would best fit under the Program as a developer-level\nresponsibility compared to a product-level responsibility. As such, it made the most sense to shift\nthe nature of these proposals from the more technical certification criterion to the Assurances\nCondition. Accordingly, we have finalized at § 170.402(b)(4) that starting January 1, 2025, and\non an ongoing basis, developers of Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must review\nand update, as necessary, source attribute information in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B), risk\nmanagement practices described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi), and summary information provided\nthrough § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi).\n\nFirst, we have finalized this Maintenance of Certification requirement to serve as a\ndiscrete connection for developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) to have complete and up-to-date descriptions of source attribute information (in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B)) at the time of certification and on an ongoing basis while their\nHealth IT Module is certified to § 170.315(b)(11). This Maintenance of Certification requirement\nbuilds on three existing Assurances Condition of Certification requirements at § 170.402(a)(1),\n(2) and (3), respectively, stating that a health IT developer must provide assurances to the\nSecretary that it “… will not take … any other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange,\naccess, and use of electronic health information,” “must ensure that its health IT certified under\nthe ONC Health IT Certification Program conforms to the full scope of the certification criteria,”\nand “must not take any action that could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use certified\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncapabilities for any purpose within the full scope of the technology’s certification.” While we\nbelieve these existing requirements within the Assurance Condition pertain to both evidence-\nbased and Predictive DSIs, as well as IRM practices, we believe this specific additional\nMaintenance of Certification requirement is necessary because of the unique, evolving, and\ndynamic nature of DSIs. Moreover, it is important for users of health IT certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) as well as the Secretary to have as an explicit assurance that developers of\ncertified health IT are keeping source attribute information up-to-date and, as applicable, that\nsuch developers are committed to IRM practices.\n\nFor example, both evidence-based and Predictive DSIs use EHI as key input data in\nunderlying rules and models. Supplying DSIs without accompanying accurate and up-to-date\ndocumentation could inhibit the appropriate use of EHI in two ways. First, it could lead the\nhealth IT developer’s customers to fail to use the DSI in appropriate ways, most obviously by\nomission of an updated statement of the DSI’s intended use as required at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(2)(i). Similarly, supplying DSIs without accompanying documentation\ncould lead to the use of a DSI on unintended populations, on individuals from groups for which\nthe DSI does not perform adequately, or by leading to the use of a DSI for which associated risks\nhave not been appropriately identified and mitigated. Further, supplying a DSI without\naccompanying documentation could inhibit the selection and use of a DSI that would make\nappropriate use of EHI. Without information on the DSI supplied by the developer of certified\nhealth IT, users will not be able to adequately determine whether the developer of certified health\nIT's supplied DSI is fit for their purpose, or whether they should select a more effective DSI.\n\nWhile we believe that, under our proposal, developers of certified health IT would have\ntaken actions to continually maintain information associated with DSIs and IRM practices, in\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccordance with Assurances requirements in § 170.402(a)(1), (2), and (3), this Maintenance of\nCertification requirement adds necessary specificity to the overall Assurances Condition of\nCertification and ensures that developers of certified health IT are firmly aware of their ongoing\nobligations associated with the certification criterion at § 170.315(b)(11). Moreover, this\nMaintenance of Certification requirement ensures that actions taken by the developer of certified\nhealth IT enable a user to access § 170.315(b)(11)-related documentation on an ongoing basis\nwill not inhibit the appropriate use of EHI. In establishing this Maintenance of Certification\nrequirement, we address acute transparency concerns from public comments regarding the\naccuracy, relevance, and timeliness of the source attribute information provided by the\ndevelopers of certified health IT. As reflected in several source attributes seeking information on\nthe ongoing maintenance of intervention implementation and use, and in particular the validity\nand fairness of predictions in local data, models and data used to drive Predictive DSIs will\nchange over time (88 FR 23792); if developers of certified health IT do not continue to keep\nassociated attribute information up to date, their failure to do so could have adverse impacts on\nuser trust, accuracy, usage, and safety.\n\nSecond, we have finalized in this Maintenance of Certification requirement that\ndevelopers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) review\nand update as necessary risk management practices described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi). This is\nsubstantially similar to what we proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D), which was to review\nannually and, as necessary, update IRM practice documentation. We discuss comments received\nto proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D) further in this final rule preamble.\n\nLast, we have finalized in this Maintenance of Certification requirement that developers\nof certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) review and update as\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnecessary summary information provided to the developer’s ONC-ACB, consistent with what we\nproposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C), which required that summary information be submitted to\nthe health IT developer’s ONC-ACB via publicly accessible hyperlink, as well as what we\nproposed at § 170.523(f)(xxi), which required ONC-ACBs to ensure that all of the information\nrequired to be submitted by the health IT developer to meet IRM requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C) were available via public hyperlink. We discuss comments received to\nproposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C) and § 170.523(f)(xxi) further in this final rule preamble.\n\n*Comments.* While some commenters agreed with and were supportive of the proposed\ndefinition and our explanation of the differences between “Enables” and “Interfaces with,”\nseveral commenters expressed concern that the proposed phrase “enables or interfaces with” was\noverly broad when applied to the proposed definition for Predictive DSI and requested that we\nfurther define and narrow the scope of these terms. These commenters stated that ONC should\nclearly define the scope of activities or technologies that “enable or interface with” Predictive\nDSIs to narrow the scope of this requirement to make it clear that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\napplies in situations such as, for example, when entities have contracts specifically covering the\nenablement and use of such technologies. Commenters also expressed concern that the phrase\n“enables or interfaces with” would require health IT developers to meet the transparency\nrequirements for all third-party apps that customers utilize via § 170.315(g)(10) technology, and\nthat it would be difficult for developers to require third parties to provide source attributes\ninformation, particularly when there is no contractual relationship between the health IT\ndeveloper and other party developers.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and have modified our final scope for Health IT\nModules that must provide source attribute information and our scope for which Predictive DSIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmust be subject to IRM practices in response to public comment. We understand through public\ncomments that interested parties viewed the scope contingent on “enables or interfaces with” as\ntoo broad and ambiguous, especially given that the scope of these terms would impact\nconditional requirements related to source attributes and risk management by way of the\nproposed attestation in § 170.315(b)(11)(v). In considering alternative constructions that would\nclarify our intent and in consideration of commenters’ concerns, we have finalized a construction\nthat narrows and replaces the two concepts of “enables,” and “interfaces with,” with “supplied\nby.” This modification is reflected in the finalized text of § 170.315(b)(11)(v) and regulatory text\nin § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) to establish conditional requirements for Health IT Modules that include\nan other party’s Predictive DSI that is supplied by the health IT developer.\n\nFor example, if a user ordered a lab test using the existing certification criterion\ncapability for computerized provider order entry-laboratory (§ 170.315(a)(3)) and the lab test\nresult was derived from a Predictive DSI used by the laboratory, such a configuration would be\nout of scope and the Health IT Module would not subject to the requirements in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v), because the Predictive DSI that rendered the lab test result was not supplied\nby (i.e., included as part of the Health IT Module) the developer of the certified health IT.\n\nWe believe that these modifications significantly narrow the scope of our proposal and\nclarify which other party Predictive DSI configurations are subject to requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11) for source attributes. We also note that the phrase “supplied by” is also\nincluded in the text of § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) to establish a conditional requirement that for each\nPredictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, is subject to\nrisk analysis, risk mitigation, and governance, which we discuss more in section “xi. Intervention\nRisk Management (IRM)” later in this final rule. We believe that developers of certified health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT with Health IT Modules that supply an other party’s Predictive DSI as part of their Health IT\nModule would be generally aware of and be well positioned to make source attribute information\navailable for user review as well as apply IRM practices given the likelihood of a high degree of\ntechnical coordination and formalized business relationship between a developer of certified\nhealth IT and an other party in such scenarios.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that the definition of Predictive DSI\nincluded the terms “interfaces with,” and “enabled by” could potentially incorporate test results\ngenerated using laboratory processes that contain algorithmic components, if the outputs of those\ntests are transmitted to an EHR, and requested that the definition exclude laboratory results\nbecause labs are already subject to other federal requirements and should not be subject to\nadditional requirements due to their results being made available through an EHR.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their input. However, we clarify that neither our\nproposed nor final definition in § 170.102 included the terms “interfaces with,” or “enabled by.”\n\nThese terms of art were used in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to establish a configuration nexus that\nwould subject Health IT Modules to additional requirements if such Health IT Modules enabled\nor interfaced with a Predictive DSI. As noted above, and given that our final policy nexus is\ndependent on “supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module,” we note that\nif the test result is generated by a Predictive DSI used by the lab itself for the generation of\nresults but the Predictive DSI is not supplied by the developer of the certified Health IT Module,\nit would be out of scope of the requirements established by the final policy. As another example,\nif a user ordered a lab test using the existing certification criterion capability for Computerized\nprovider order entry-laboratory (§ 170.315(a)(3)) and the lab test result was derived from a\nPredictive DSI used by the laboratory, such a configuration would be out of scope and the Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT Module would not subject to the requirements in § 170.315(b)(11), because the Predictive\nDSI that rendered the lab test result was not supplied by the health IT developer as part of its\nHealth IT Module.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "At 88 FR 23787, we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) that Health IT Modules certified to\n§ 170.315(b)(11) enable a user to review a plain language description of source attribute\ninformation as indicated at a minimum via direct display, drill down, or link out from a Health IT\nModule. We noted that § 170.315(g)(3) “safety-enhanced design,” applies to the existing\n§ 170.315(a)(9) criterion and in keeping with that applicability, we proposed that safety-\nenhanced and user-centered design processes described in § 170.315(g)(3) would apply to the\nnew certification criterion proposed in § 170.315(b)(11) as well. We proposed to update\n§ 170.315(g)(3) accordingly to reference the proposed § 170.315(b)(11).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were generally split on supporting or not supporting the\nproposal in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) enable a\nuser to review a plain language description of source attribute information as indicated at a\nminimum via direct display, drill down, or link out from a Health IT Module. Those in support\nnoted that it would have the benefit of allowing users to assess the DSI’s quality and thereby\nenhancing trustworthiness; enable those with sufficient knowledge to understand the data to\nmake informed purchasing decisions; and give flexibility that ensures that the recommendations\nand guidance provided by these systems align with the organization’s unique workflows and\npatient populations, facilitating seamless integration into clinical practice. Several commenters\nagreed that user feedback can be a useful tool to support quality improvement within health IT\nand emphasizing transparency and customization allows healthcare organizations to tailor\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision support systems to their specific needs. Other commenters urged ONC not to adopt the\ndirect display, drill down, or link requirement observing that including too much information in\nthe direct display can negatively impact usability and user adoption in comparison to providing\nrational and accessible paths to deeper information via click-paths that are based on user-\ncentered design principles. These commenters worried that requiring “at a minimum direct\ndisplay, drill down, or link out,” could unintentionally inhibit innovative user interfaces and user\ndesigns to enable user access to source attributes.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support, and we note that requirements\noriginally proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) for source attributes built off more than a decade of\nexisting expectations for source attributes in the current CDS criterion at § 170.315(a)(9)(v)\nwhere the expectation for direct display, drill down, or link out had been described at 77 FR\n54215. However, in consideration of comments, we have not finalized the requirements for\nsource attribute information to be available via direct display, drill down, or link out from a\nHealth IT Module. Rather we have finalized a source attributes requirement in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv) without the text “at a minimum via direct display, drill down, or link out\nfrom a Health IT Module.” While we have not finalized a requirement for presenting source\nattribute information to users in the regulation text at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv), we reiterate the\nrequirement in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1) that Health IT Modules enable a limited set of\nidentified users to access complete and up-to-date plain language descriptions of source attribute\ninformation in paragraphs § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B). And we have\nalso included a requirement in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(1) to enable a limited set of identified\nusers to record, change and access the same source attribute information. The phrase “limited set\nof identified users” conveys that the capability is not required for all users of the Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule. Rather, that the capability can be constrained to a smaller userbase that are identified to\nhave the privileges necessary to use the capabilities in § 170.315(b)(11), including the capability\nto record, change, and access source attributes and source attribute information. We have\nprovided this flexibility so that any number and configuration of users may record, change, and\naccess source attribute information according to organizational needs. For example, if a client of\na developer of certified health IT hosts source attributes for each deployed evidence-based or\nPredictive DSI centrally, a Health IT Module could include a hyperlink from a dashboard or\nother user interface to a user at the point-of-care. Additionally, this flexibility could limit record,\nchange, and access privileges to a user who has responsibilities for an organization’s\nprocurement and implementation decisions.\n\nFinally, we did not receive any substantive or direct feedback regarding our proposal to\nupdate “safety-enhanced design,” to reference the certification criterion finalized in\n§ 170.315(b)(11). We continue to believe that just as the CDS criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) was\nsubject to safety-enhanced design requirements, so too should the revised criterion in §\n170.315(b)(11). Thus, we have finalized our proposed modification to § 170.315(g)(3) “safety-\nenhanced design,” to reference the certification criterion finalized in § 170.315(b)(11).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarity on the proposal for source attributes noting that\nthe proposal was ambiguous as to what source attributes would need to be implemented and\nrequested that ONC provide more clarity on the expectation of how source attributes must be\nimplemented in a Health IT Module. Specifically, one commenter requested clarification on\nwhether software should support source attribution when clinically appropriate, noting that many\nhealth care providers and health systems have structures in place to track appropriate source\nattributes. One commenter requested additional clarity on how the information being available at\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe point of care should be used in real time stating that most of the source attribute information\nwill be relevant to the organization while it makes procurement and implementation decisions\nversus during care delivery.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ suggestions and have finalized our proposal\nwith modifications in consideration of these and related comments. We have made several\nmodifications to reduce the ambiguity cited by commenters related to the source attributes\nproposals. We have separately identified requirements related to accessing up-to-date and\ncomplete information for DSI supplied in the Health IT Module at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) and\nrequirements related to enabling customers to modify source attributes and source attribute\ninformation for DSI at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B). We also separately list source attribute categories\nfor evidence-based and Predictive DSI at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B), respectively. We\nbelieve that information available as source attributes will have value both as reference\ninformation to individual users evaluating the use of a DSI on an individual patient—for\ninstance, by assessing whether it has been recently evaluated at their health system and whether\nit has been shown to perform well for a patient like theirs—and for the organization during\nprocurement, implementation, and analysis.\n\nTo further address potential ambiguity about how source attributes must be implemented\nin Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11), we have finalized uniform requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv) for Health IT Modules to support source attributes listed at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B). This means that all Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) must support the categories, but not necessarily the content, for each source\nattribute listed at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B). For example, Health IT Modules must support\nuser access to complete and up-to-date source attribute information in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nonly if the Predictive DSI is supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module.\n\nWe have provided additional specificity about the technical capabilities required to\nsupport source attributes at § 170.315(b)(11)(v). As described above, we have not finalized our\nproposal for an attestation statement. Rather, we have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(v) a set of\nfour capabilities that Health IT Modules must support related to source attributes. Each of these\ncapabilities was proposed in different parts of § 170.315(b)(11) in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\nFirst, we have finalized requirements for “Source attribute access and modification” in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v). Specifically, we finalized a requirement in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1) that is\nsubstantially similar to what we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) to “Enable a user to review a\nplain language description of source attribute information as indicated and at a minimum via\ndirect display, drill down, or link out from a Health IT Module . . . .” The finalized “access”\nrequirement states in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1) that for evidence-based and Predictive DSIs\nsupplied by the health IT developer, the Health IT Module must enable a limited set of identified\nusers to access complete and up-to-date plain language descriptions of source attribute\ninformation specified in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B) as finalized. As discussed earlier, we\nhave not finalized proposed requirements for Health IT Modules to make source attribute\ninformation available via direct display, drill down, or link out.\n\nSecond, we have finalized at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(2) that for Predictive DSIs supplied\nby the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, the Health IT Module must indicate\nwhen information is not available for review for source attributes in paragraphs\n(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(iii), (iv), and (v); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(ii) and (iv); and\n(b)(11)(iv)(B)(9). This requirement is finalized as a modified version of what was proposed at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(D)(1) and § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(D)(2), which required Health IT Modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto indicate a source attribute is missing if the source attribute included the “if available” phrase.\n\nWe clarify that per conformance with this certification criterion and its associated maintenance\nof certification requirement adopted as part of § 170.402(b)(4), if and when information related\nto these source attributes are generated, the developer of certified health IT must make this\ninformation available to users. For example, if the developer of certified health IT gets newly\navailable information on the validity of the intervention in local data\n(§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(ii)) following the deployment of a Predictive DSI, that information\nmust be made available as source attributes information to reflect up-to-date descriptions of\nsource attributes.\n\nThird and fourth, we have finalized two requirements related to the ability to “modify”\nsource attributes and source attribute information at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B). At §\n170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(1), we have finalized a requirement that for evidence-based DSIs and\nPredictive DSIs, the Health IT Module must enable a limited set of identified users to record,\nchange, and access source attributes in paragraphs (b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section. At §\n170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(2) we have finalized that, for Predictive DSIs, a Health IT Module must\nenable a limited set of identified users to record, change, and access additional source attributes\nnot specified in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B). These requirements are substantially similar to what we\nproposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(E) while retaining the ability to access or review this\ninformation as would have been required in proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(v). In proposed §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi)(E) we proposed that a Health IT Module must enable a limited set of\nidentified users to “author and revise,” source attribute information beyond source attributes\nlisted. We note that the capability to record and change replaces the proposed capability to author\nand revise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested guidance on the level of detail required in these\ndescriptions and specification of “plain language descriptions” for which audience (e.g.,\ndevelopers, clinicians, and other end-users) and guidelines on how to present this information,\nnoting the concern that a user may have difficulty finding the required documentation depending\non how the interface is designed. Commenters expressed concern that the proposal to enable a\nuser to review a plain language description of source attribute information could result in legal\nliability and vulnerability for clinicians and health care providers, underscoring the need that the\ninformation provided in the new source attributes for Predictive DSI are useful and\nunderstandable.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns. We note that requirements related to\na plain language description are now included at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1). When we indicate\n“plain language description,” we mean language that the intended audience can readily\nunderstand and use because that language is clear, concise, well-organized, accurately describes\nthe information, and follows other best practices of plain language writing. We encourage model\ndevelopers to consider what information would be useful for users to determine if a Predictive\nDSI is FAVES without providing difficult to understand technical details. We agree that\nproviding this information in a useful form will be essential. Comments regarding legal liability\nare outside the scope of this rulemaking. Therefore, we decline to finalize any such change.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarity regarding cases where third-party IT that is\nenabled or interfaced with certified health IT but is modified by users or a different third-party\ndeveloper such that the added functionality results in the generation of a Predictive DSI, and\nwhether such cases would be subject to conditional requirements for source attributes listed in §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and deployment of or engagement in intervention risk management\npractices discussed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vii).\n\n*Response.* In a scenario where an other party technology is modified by a different other\nparty (e.g., users or a different third-party developer) such that the initial technology meets the\ndefinition of a Predictive DSI, we would categorize the modified technology as a Predictive DSI\ndeveloped by an other party. A Health IT Module may be expected to have the technical\ncapability for users to record, change and access source attributes of this modified technology,\nand may be expected to provide up-to-date source attribute information if the Predictive DSI is\nsupplied by the developer of certified health IT as part of the Health IT Module.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "Assessment Data Use\nWe proposed at 88 FR 23787 to include as source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A)(1)\nthrough (4) the source attributes currently found in § 170.315(a)(9)(v)(A)(1) through (4).\n\nAdditionally, we proposed that the use of three additional specific types of data in a DSI be\nincluded as source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) – Demographic data elements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A)(5), SDOH data elements in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A)(6), and Health\nStatus Assessment data elements in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A)(7). We noted at 88 FR 23787 that\n“types of data in a DSI” means that the DSI includes any of these data as inputs or otherwise\nexpressly rely on any of these data in generating an output or outputs. We explained that by\nproposing to modify the source attributes as part of proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) relative to\nthe existing attributes in § 170.315(a)(9)(v)(A), we expected that information would be made\navailable to users if the specific data elements within these three data categories were used in the\nDSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext note. We note for readers that while all of the proposals just summarized were\npart of proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vi), we have finalized modified versions of these requirements\nas part of § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A). As a result, we discuss the finalized requirements with that\ncontext in mind.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the proposal to include the\nrequirement that certified Health IT Modules should provide users with source attributes for DSI,\nincluding the three additional specific types of data of demographic, SDOH, and health status\nassessment data elements. These commenters stated that it would have the benefit of enabling\nindividuals and organizations to understand the nature of certified health IT, whether there are\ninherent biases, and how best to use the technology for a specific patient population.\n\nCommenters also stated that requiring developers of certified health IT to report on these data\nelements’ inclusion will assist providers in both ensuring the whole patient is cared for and that\nthere is transparency as part of that whole-person care. Commenters noted that the proposed\nrequirements would address pressing concerns that AI algorithms can reinforce biases related to\nsocioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, and other identities\nand conditions, observing that recent advances in AI stand to potentially harm patients by\nreinforcing implicit and explicit biases that do not reflect the diverse population of America and\nthat may only increase health inequities. Commenters supported the public transparency\nrequirements for source attribute information as an important measure to avoid exacerbating\nthese inequities.\n\nA minority of commenters did not support the proposal stating that the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule would create significant implementation burden with unclear benefits. One commenter\nsuggested that the HTI-1 Proposed Rule may also paradoxically increase disparities by reducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninnovation and the implementation of DSIs due to increased regulatory burden. One commenter\nexpressed concern that the preamble was unclear on what it meant for an evidence-based\ndecision support intervention to “use” or “include” patient demographics and observations,\nSDOH, or health status assessments.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and agree that by highlighting when an\nevidence-based DSI uses patient demographics, SDOH, or health status assessments data\nelements,<sup>115</sup>\nusers are empowered to interrogate and ensure that the DSI is appropriate. We\nbelieve that identification of race, ethnicity, language, age (date of birth), sexual orientation,\ngender information, SDOH, and health status assessments, such as disability, data elements, if\nincluded as part of an evidence-based DSI, would greatly improve the possibility of identifying\nand mitigating the risks of employing evidence-based DSIs for patient care, including those\nrelated to exacerbating racial disparities and promoting bias. We believe that this requirement\nrepresents a low burden that is unlikely to reduce innovation and implementation of DSIs. We\nalso thank commenters for identifying ambiguities in what it means for an evidence-based\ndecision support intervention to “use” or “include” these data elements. We clarify that our\nintention is to enable a user to understand if one or more of these data elements are included as\ninputs or otherwise expressly relied upon to generate an output in an evidence-based DSI. We\nalso intend that, if the data elements are included, the user is informed which one(s) are used in\nthe evidence-based DSI. This means that a user must be able to review whether a data element\nrelevant to those categories in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13) (as expressed by the standards in\n\n\nFootnote 115:\nFor purposes of this final rule, health status assessments are assessments of a health-related matter of interest,\nimportance, or worry to a patient, patient’s family, or patient’s health care provider that could identify a need,\nproblem, or condition. See ONC’s Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA) at https://www.healthit.gov/isa/uscdi-\ndata-class/health-status-assessments#uscdi-v3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.213) is used in the evidence-based DSI, and if so, which specific data element or elements\nare used in the evidence-based DSI.\n\nWe do not prescribe how this information is communicated to a user, nor do we\nprescribe a minimum level of context at this time. For example, we do not require that a source\nattribute indicating the use of an SDOH data element in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(6) must\ndescribe how the data element is used as part of the evidence-based DSI. Instead, we require a\nHealth IT Module to enable a user to review whether an SDOH data element is used as part of\nthe evidence-based DSI and which SDOH data element (as expressed by the standards in\n§ 170.213) is used as part of the evidence-based DSI.\n\nAfter consideration of comments, we have finalized as part of § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)\npatient demographic, SDOH, and health status assessment data elements in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5) through (13) as expressed in the standards in § 170.213. We note that,\nconsistent with the dates established in § 170.213, compliance with USCDI v1 will be required\nto initially meet this certification criterion until compliance with USCDI v3 becomes required as\npart of this certification criterion (i.e., January 1, 2026). As a result, for the first compliance date\nassociated with § 170.315(b)(11) a Health IT Module may include, but is not required to include,\nidentification of the use of patient demographic data elements that are only found in USCDI v3\nas part of evidence-based DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters responded to our solicitation for comment on whether\nwe should require a certain format or order in which these source attributes must appear to users.\n\nCommenters noted that the proposed source attribute requirements would require each\norganization to craft their own documentation process and suggested that ONC collaborate with\ninterested parties to implement and refine a standards-based approach for capturing and sharing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource attributes, including sharing both machine-readable and human-readable tables/lists of\nDSI source attribute information. Commenters also observed that requiring information about\nDSIs to be submitted in a standard format will focus the scope of the information disclosed,\ncreate consistency in the kind of information shared about these AI tools, and contribute to a\npresentation of this information for end users that is repeatable and digestible. Commenters noted\nthat without a standardization and strategic placement, providers moving across organizations\nwill experience the added stress of learning each organization’s method of addressing DSI,\ncompounding burden. One commenter supported including HL7 consensus-based\nimplementation guides for AI information, and another commenter recommended that ONC\nshould produce a document format for DSI developers to use in conveying information to EHR\ndevelopers and interface specialists. One commenter suggested that there are two common ways\nto present this type of long list of data: alphabetically or by type (often organized alphabetically\nunderneath each category) and recommended categorizing by type of data then presenting each\nlist therein alphabetically. For example: Demographic Data: date of birth, race, sex Health\nStatus: disability status, smoking status\nOne commenter observed that to implement a standardized format may be burdensome\nfor health IT developers but also will be beneficial to reduce bias in decision making and will\nencourage smaller, third-party applications to be more transparent and responsible in their\ndevelopment, stating that there are potential benefits to requiring documentation of what a\nclinical decision support algorithm does, and provides certainty that a level of testing and trials\nhas been done to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the model.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments received regarding a standardized format for\nsource attribute information. We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we were not aware of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwidely agreed upon best practices for the format in which these elements or source attributes\ninformation should be displayed. We are also not aware of a consensus-based standardized\nformat that might best meet the objective described by the commenter to reduce bias in decisions\nmaking. However, we are aware of industry efforts to standardize a format to display information\nabout technology in the form of a “model card” or “nutritional label” for healthcare (88 FR\n23794). We did not propose a specific format for source attributes, and we decline to finalize any\nspecific formats. We believe this represents an ideal space for interested parties across industry,\nacademia, government, and the non-profit sector (such as SDOs and patient advocacy\norganizations) to collaborate. We note that part of our rationale for being flexible in the use of\nstandardized formats and placement of source attributes within users’ workflows is precisely\nbecause there is a lack of consensus. We look forward to working with interested parties to\ndevelop consensus-based standards across numerous and far-reaching types of use cases.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "At 88 FR 23788–23795, we proposed source attributes applicable for all Predictive DSIs\nthat are enabled by or interface with certified Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11).\n\nThese source attributes were intended to provide users with greater insight into the model\nincorporated into a particular Predictive DSI and intended to provide information for an array of\nuses, including in support of so-called “model cards” or algorithm “nutrition labels” that have\nbeen described by others.<sup>116</sup>\nThis proposed requirement applied to developers of certified health\nIT that attest “yes” in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A).\n\n\nFootnote 116:\nMitchell, Margaret, et al. \"Model cards for model reporting.\" Proceedings of the conference on fairness,\naccountability, and transparency. 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noted that the proposals for source attributes would not require disclosing or sharing\nintellectual property (IP) existing in the developer’s health IT, including other parties’ IP. We\nreiterated that source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) would not require disclosure of\nproprietary information or IP (88 FR 23788). We also noted that if developers of certified health\nIT would like to include a capability for other parties to record source attributes into a Health IT\nModule in a way that shields the developer of certified health IT from having access to the other\nparty source attributes, they could do so, but that this was not proposed as a required technical\ncapability within the proposed criterion.\n\nNew Source Attributes for Predictive DSI\nAt 88 FR 23789, we proposed to add fourteen new source attributes for Predictive DSIs\nthat enable or interface with Health IT Modules. Consistent with our proposals in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi), we proposed that these new source attributes listed in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C) would be in plain language and available for user review via direct\ndisplay, drill down, or link out from a Health IT Module certified to § 170.315(b)(11) and for\nwhich the developer attested “yes” in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A).\n\nWe clarified that we proposed to require that developers must enable a user to review a\nplain language description of source attribute information as indicated and at a minimum via\ndirect display, drill down, or link out from a Health IT Module and that information on these\nsource attributes must be provided by the developer of certified health IT unless the attribute\ncontained the phrase “if available” (discussed at 88 FR 23789) or was developed by an other\nparty, as proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(D) discussed at 88 FR 23795-23796.\n\nContext note. We note for readers that while all of the proposals just summarized were\npart of proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C), we have finalized modified versions of these\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirements as part of § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B). As a result, we discuss the finalized\nrequirements with that context in mind.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were mixed in their support or opposition to requirements for\nsource attributes for Predictive DSI, with those in support noting that it would create greater\ntransparency for patients and providers that is key to building trust in AI. Commenters who were\nsupportive noted that it would be critical for the end user to understand how a Predictive DSI is\ndeveloped, evaluated, and how it should be used appropriately. Commenters also noted that\nhealth care providers would benefit because transparency promotes the exercise of a provider’s\njudgment at the point of care, which can help avoid errors and mitigate algorithmic biases, and\nthat source attributes will help organizations make informed decisions around potential\nimplementation. One commenter noted that complex predictive models that incorporate difficult-\nto-observe validity or fairness issues may lead to harm if left unchecked, resulting in bias that\ncan lead to decisions that can have a collective, disparate impact on certain groups of people\neven without the programmer’s intention to discriminate.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback and their support. As expressed in\nour proposals for § 170.315(b)(11), we believe that transparency is a prerequisite for high-quality\nPredictive DSIs to be trusted by clinicians, patients, health systems, software developers, and\nother interested parties. We believe that transparency can help to reduce the harm of complex\npredictive models by informing the use, disuse, updating or decommissioning of such models. As\ndescribed in more detail below, we have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) modified versions\nof our proposals for Predictive DSI-specific source attributes.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters did not support our proposal, with many expressing\nconcerns that our proposal is too prescriptive and limiting to industry innovation, the source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattribute categories and disclosure requirements create unnecessary burden on health IT\ndevelopers and providers, and stifle competition. Several commenters were concerned that the\nproposed source attribute disclosure requirements could compromise patient privacy and\nrequested clarification on the granularity of data elements that developers must disclose.\n\nCommenters recommended ONC limit the type of data that is made publicly available from high-\nimpact DSIs to protect patient information privacy and security and safeguard protected health\ninformation (“PHI”) or sensitive data.\n\n*Response.* We respectfully disagree with these commenters. In developing proposed\nsource attributes for Predictive DSIs, we sought a balance between limited prescriptiveness and\nsufficient detail to enable thorough transparency of source attribute information to users. Our\nselection of the proposed attributes was guided by reviews of existing model reporting\nguidelines, including seventeen different sets of industry- and academia-developed\nrecommendations for information to be reported on models and related standards.<sup>117</sup>\nBecause\n\n\nFootnote 117:\nScott, Ian, Stacy Carter, and Enrico Coiera. \"Clinician checklist for assessing suitability of machine learning\napplications in healthcare.\" BMJ Health & Care Informatics 28.1 (2021).\n\nLiu X, Cruz Rivera S, Moher D, Calvert MJ, Denniston AK; SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI Working Group.\n\nReporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the CONSORT-AI\nextension.

In our review, we emphasized\nattributes that: 1) were most commonly included in the reviewed reporting guidelines; 2) we\nbelieved would be most interpretable by both health IT professionals and users; 3) were focused\non identifying issues of bias; and 4) were intended to show that the model would perform\neffectively outside of the specific context in which it was developed. In finalizing Predictive DSI\nsource attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B), we have provided information on what we believe\nshould be included in each attribute based on our understanding of the current best practices in\nthis area. However, given the varied technologies, applications, and contexts in which Predictive\nDSIs may be used, we have sought to keep requirements sufficiently flexible to meet varied use\ncases.

Many developers of certified health IT that do not supply a\nPredictive DSI as part of their Health IT Module are among those developers with smaller\nrevenues and fewer clients. These developers will be able to certify to the criterion at §\n170.315(b)(11) while expending limited additional development resources on products they have\ncertified currently. Specifically, these developers will likely have no costs related to providing\ncomplete and up-to-date source attribute information for Predictive DSI supplied by the\ndeveloper or engaging in risk management and annually update risk management information.\n\nWe believe that our finalized Predictive DSI source attributes strike a balance between\nprescriptiveness and flexibility that is necessary to foster a nascent information ecosystem that\ncan help users understand whether the Predictive DSI they are using (as supplied by their health\nIT developer as part of its Health IT Module) is FAVES. Moreover, we believe these source\nattributes help establish a consistent transparency baseline, or foundation, especially given that\nwe have not established requirements for specific measures. Rather, we encourage industry,\nacademic, professional associations, and other interested parties to determine which information\nbest fits each use case. We also do not believe that the information in source attributes creates a\nrisk to patient privacy, given the level of detail at which information should be provided, as\ndescribed in more detail in response to concerns related to intellectual property. We also note\nthat we are affording flexibilities related to source attributes that are only required once\ninformation for them become available, such as source attributes related to validity and fairness\nof prediction in external and local data. We have finalized the categories of source attributes\nrelated to Predictive DSIs at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) with modifications and clarifications to\nsource attribute category subparagraphs, described below in this final rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters, including health information technology companies,\ninsurance companies, software developers, and professional trade associations, expressed\nconcerns that providing users with access to information described as part of source attributes\nwould expose proprietary information regarding the predictive algorithm or model and risk\nexposing intellectual property (IP) among other risks, including that disclosure of such\ninformation would stifle competition and innovation. Some commenters suggested ONC specify\nthat the information in our proposals does not include confidential information such as IP. Some\ncommenters were concerned that source attributes could enable reconstruction of the algorithm\nand that it would create a power imbalance between small and startup “other parties” and large\nincumbent developers of certified health IT, which could either refuse to display source attributes\nfrom other parties or use information in those source attributes inappropriately. While many\ncommenters were vague in their concerns related to revealing IP and trade secrets a small\nnumber of commenters identified the “Intervention Development” category of source attributes\nas problematic and another commenter noted that the output of the intervention would constitute\nIP. During further fact-finding, commenters mentioned specific concerns around source attribute\ninformation on how input and output variables were identified, as well as the model parameters,\nhyperparameters, or the results of tuning, which they described as crucial pieces of intellectual\nproperty, proprietary information, or trade secrets. Another commenter included “model type,\ntarget definition (intended use), and inputs” as information that could include IP or proprietary\ninformation.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested ways to mitigate IP and proprietary information concerns,\nincluding listing data classes instead of data elements used in the algorithm; limiting source\nattribute information to summary information for high-risk use cases only; limiting source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattribute requirements to algorithms developed by developers of certified health IT; requiring\nonly links to DSIs centrally supported by a government-sponsored resource and to information\nmaintained by the FDA if the DSI is regulated as a medical device; and giving developers the\nability to exclude or redact source attribute information they considered proprietary.\n\n*Response.* As described in detail below, we respectfully disagree with the claims that our\nproposed, and now final, requirements for source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) would\nresult in disclosures of IP, trade secrets, or proprietary information. Nor do we believe that our\nrequirements for source attributes would stifle competition and innovation. Given the overall\nscope changes and numerous clarifications offered through this final rule to narrow health IT\ndeveloper’s scope of responsibilities (to only those Predictive DSIs that are supplied as part of its\nHealth IT Module) we believe we have substantively address commenters’ concerns regarding\nexposure of proprietary information to other parties as well as exposure to proprietary\ninformation originating from other parties. Additionally, we believe that the transparency needs\nare so acute for Predictive DSIs that the public benefit outweighs any remaining concerns.\n\nOverall, we anticipate that better information regarding Predictive DSIs will bolster the use of\nhigh-quality, fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe predictive algorithms across the\nhealthcare landscape.\n\nFirst, we do not agree that the information we require for Predictive DSI source attributes\nis new or novel within the healthcare context, presenting authors of Predictive DSIs with new or\nnovel concerns related to IP or proprietary information. We note that we analyzed and drew from\nmore than a dozen widely accepted and used reporting guidelines, used by researchers and\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers to demonstrate the validity of algorithms in peer-reviewed literature.<sup>118</sup>\nWe believe\nthat much of the same information required for publication by the New England Journal of\nMedicine or the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, ought to be routinely\nand consistently available for user review to improve the trustworthiness of Predictive DSIs. We\nnote that some reporting guidelines, from which we draw our own source attributes, have more\nthan 15,000 citations across peer-reviewed, academic literature.<sup>119</sup>\nSecond, we have clarified the scope of our requirements by adding detail to the\ninformation expected as part of source attributes in what is now finalized at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B). We note that these explicit requirements in regulation text mirror the\nrequirements described previously in preamble or represent a subset of requirements previously\ndescribed in preamble. The information required in source attributes is not intended to include\ndetailed information on model parameters, hyperparameters, detailed specifics around how input\nor output variables are defined, transformed, or otherwise operationalized. We do not believe that\ninformation at that level of detail is necessary for source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) or\nnecessary for users of a Predictive DSI to determine whether it is fair, appropriate, valid,\neffective, and safe.\n\nThird, as it relates to “Intervention Development,” source attributes, which include input\nfeatures, such as exclusion and inclusion criteria that influenced the data set; use of race,\nethnicity, language (REL), SDOH, and health assessment variables as input features; and a\ndescription of relevance of training data to intended deployed setting, we note that these source\n\n\nFootnote 118:\nSee footnote 117.\n\n\nFootnote 119:\nTable 1. Summary of 15 Model Reporting Guideline Papers. Lu JH, Callahan A, Patel BS, et al. Assessment of\nAdherence to Reporting Guidelines by Commonly Used Clinical Prediction Models From a Single Vendor: A\nSystematic Review. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2227779. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.27779.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes are important to give users a sense of whether they ought to use the Predictive DSI on\nan individual in front of them, or on individuals generally seen within the user’s organization.\n\nUnderstanding whether specific input features, such as race, sex, or food insecurity is part of the\ntraining data set for a Predictive DSI could present a user with critical information on its\nrelevance and validity to individual patients or patient cohorts for which the Predictive DSI is\nbeing applied. We further ask in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(4)(iii) for some sense of how\nrepresentative demographic variables are within a Predictive DSI’s training data set, which could\nbe equally important if the Predictive DSI was trained on data dominated by one racial group and\napplied to a different group.\n\nTo further mitigate concerns around IP, we have limited the input features that must be\nincluded to those listed at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13). We understand that resources are\nexpended to identify and operationalize numerous input features to improve Predictive DSI\nperformance. We believe this list narrows the scope of features that must be reported and\naddresses concerns about revealing IP underlying curation of input features more broadly.\n\nFurthermore, in developing information for source attributes, we encourage model developers to\nconsider the level of information that would be useful for health systems and end users to best\ndetermine if a Predictive DSI is FAVES without providing difficult to understand technical\ndetails that might reveal trade secretes or proprietary information. We also reiterate that\ninformation provided should be described in plain language, as stated at §\n170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(1).\n\nWe disagree with commenters concerns that identifying the output of the intervention\nwould constitute IP. We provided an example of a prediction of the likelihood that an individual\nwill be readmitted among individuals recently discharged (88 FR 23789). We do not believe that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe description of an output, at the low level of detail provided in the example, is likely to\nconstitute intellectual property or trade secrets. We believe that a description of the output\nproduced by the model, along with “intended use,” is foundational to understanding how the\nmodel is meant to be deployed and used.\n\nFourth, we appreciate the many commenters that raised IP and proprietary information\nconcerns while also providing ways to mitigate those concerns, primarily by limiting the number\nor the scope of source attributes that should be available to users. Based on the scope changes to\nfinal § 170.315(b)(11) and other clarifications issued throughout this final rule, we have not\nfinalized additional mitigation suggestions by commenters. We believe that the clarifications\nprovided as part of this response on the level of detail required for source attributes (as well as\nother corresponding responses below) will sufficiently mitigate concerns related to IP.\n\nLast, while we understand concerns raised by commenters regarding a potential to create\na power imbalance between small and startup “other parties” and large incumbent developers of\ncertified health IT, which could either refuse to display source attributes from other parties or\nuse information in those source attributes inappropriately, we believe our finalized scope for\nPredictive DSI source attributes addresses these concerns. Particularly, we note that these source\nattributes must be complete and up-to-date if they are supplied by the health IT developer as part\nof its Health IT Module. In this scenario, other party source attributes could be directly supplied\nto a developer certified health IT’s customer (who will have both the ability to select this other\nparty’s Predictive DSI and have a Health IT Module support Predictive DSI source attribute\ncategories for the other party’s source attributes, even if their developer does not supply a\nPredictive DSI as part of its Health IT Module, due to requirements at § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(B)\nand § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)). Further, if developer of certified health IT a with Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule certified to § 170.315(b)(11) would like to include a capability for other parties to\nrecord source attributes into a Health IT Module in a way that shields the developer of certified\nhealth IT from having access to the other party source attributes, the developer of certified health\nIT may do so.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters were concerned that our proposal requires health IT\nsoftware developers to expend significant resources to gather information from numerous\nsources and is an unnecessary burden. Specifically, commenters noted that requiring developers\nof certified health IT to monitor, catalog, request information, and conduct analysis requires\nsignificant resources that will need to be redirected from development, enhancement, and\nassessment of its own software.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and as part of this final rule we have substantially\nreduced the scope of the final requirements to be fully within the developer of certified health\nIT’s purview, such that the developer will know and be able to fully estimate the resources it will\nneed to expend to maintain complete and up-to-date source attribute information (which could be\nlimited if, for example, the developer does not supply any Predictive DSIs as part of its Health IT\nModule). We appreciate the comment and as part of this final rule we have substantially reduced\nthe scope of the finalized requirements to be fully within the developer of certified health IT’s\npurview, such that the developer will know and be able to fully estimate the resources it will\nneed to expend to maintain complete and up-to-date source attribute information (which could be\nlimited if, for example, the developer does not supply any Predictive DSIs as part of it Health IT\nModule). We also believe that this scope and associated information is necessary for the\ntrustworthy use of Predictive DSIs and that the benefits will be commensurate with the burden\nimplied. As stated numerous times throughout the preamble, our intention in requiring such work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis to better ensure that high quality Predictive DSIs can be more effectively used to improve\npatient care.\n\nGiven the many comments received from interested parties, we have limited the source\nattributes that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) are required to complete and keep current to those that are related to Predictive\nDSIs supplied by the developer of certified health IT, which we believe would limit the resources\nrequired to gather information from other parties. We describe in further detail these\nrequirements in subsequent responses in this final rule. We reiterate that Health IT Modules must\nsupport the capability for other party source attribute information to be accessible to users, but\nthat developers are not required to receive or proactively acquire such information for user\naccess from these other parties just because a user selects (i.e., activates) a Predictive DSI using\nthe developer’s Health IT Module.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters recommended that the requirements should be limited to\nrequire summary information of source attributes and only for high-impact Predictive DSI that\npresents a greater risk of potential harm. One commenter recommended that ONC should take a\nrisk-based approach and limit Predictive DSIs in scope and exclude low-risk use cases for\nconsumers, such as general wellness.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. However, the Program is not predicated on\nlevels of risk that a technology may pose. As previously noted, we believe that identifying\nwhether a Predictive DSI is “high-risk” or could have a “high-impact” across millions of patients\nis not appropriate for this rulemaking because Predictive DSIs that may in some sense be “low-\nrisk,” such as those that predict appointment no-shows can (in some cases indirectly) impact the\nhealthcare of millions of individuals and thereby be “high-impact.” We also believe that it is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimportant to require the same information for Predictive DSIs supplied by developers of certified\nhealth IT. We reiterate that we have not established requirements for specific measures of\nvalidity or fairness, for example. Rather, we encourage industry, academic, professional\nassociations, and other interested parties to determine which information best fits each use case.\n\nFor instance, a radiological or oncologic society might develop recommendation on how to\nmeasure fairness for a Predictive DSI that predicts onset of melanoma in diverse populations,\nand we encourage the use of those measures as they continue to be refined. We are also aware of\nongoing work to standardize approaches to select specific measures and performance targets and\nencourage developers to follow those best practices.<sup>120</sup>\nWe believe our requirements at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) are consistent with industry and academia-developed reporting\nguidelines, and are appropriately balanced and flexible, while ensuring a consistent baseline of\ninformation users need to make informed decisions regarding their use of a Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns that our proposal was duplicative of\nFDA requirements, noting that they believed our proposal imposes duplicative and unnecessary\nrequirements for software solely based on its use within certified health IT, creating additional\nburdens for device manufacturers who are also regulated by the FDA. Commenters expressed\nconcern regarding the existing authority that the FDA has over device CDS, which may result in\na duplication of efforts with differing requirements, meaning providers and EHR vendors would\nneed to satisfy two sets of regulations. One commenter noted that they believe that in some\ninstances, publication of source attribute information distinct from existing labeling could require\n\n\nFootnote 120:\nHealth AI Partnership. “Define performance targets,” https://healthaipartnership.org/guiding-question/define-\nperformance-targets Data Science and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University. “Aequitas”\nhttp://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/aequitas/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplemental FDA authorization. Some commenters suggested that regulating source attributes\nwould be accomplished more effectively by the FDA.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by these commenters, which is why we\nworked closely with the FDA on development of our proposals in § 170.315(b)(11), especially\nregarding Predictive DSI-specific source attributes. We are aware that technologies that meet the\ndefinition for Predictive DSI within the Program may be considered Non-Device CDS, be\nconsidered CDS with device software functions, or lie outside of FDA’s purview, depending on\nthe specifics of the technology. We worked with the FDA expressly to minimize duplication of\neffort and maximize alignment across our distinct and different authorities.\n\nWe coordinated with FDA to ensure that the information required within source attributes\nin our finalized § 170.315(b)(11) is complementary and not conflicting with the information that\nFDA describes in its CDS Guidance, finalized in September 2022.<sup>121</sup>\nSpecifically, we believe\nthat both (1) the content of the information described for source attributes in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv) and (2) the capabilities required in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) and §\n170.315(b)(11)(v) are complementary and aligned with FDA CDS guidance and could reduce\nburdens for entities that develop device software functions that also meet the definition of\nPredictive DSI.\n\nWe note that section 520I(1)(E) of the Food Drug & Cosmetics (FD&C) Act (Pub. L. 75-\n717, Jun. 1938) excludes from the definition of “device,” software functions that, among other\nthings, are intended for the purpose of enabling a healthcare professional to independently\nreview the basis for recommendations that such software presents. As part of this alignment\n\n\nFootnote 121:\nSee https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/clinical-decision-support-\nsoftware\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffort across both FDA and ONC regulatory requirements, we identified and have finalized\nsource attribute information that could plausibly address some of the informational requirements\nin 520I(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act, including:\n• § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(2) Purpose of the intervention, including: (i) Intended use of the\nintervention; (ii) Intended patient population(s) for the intervention’s use; (iii) Intended\nuser(s); and (iv) Intended decision-making role the intervention was designed to be\nused/for (e.g., informs, augments, replaces clinical management).\n\n• § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(4) Intervention development details and input features, including\nat a minimum: (i) Exclusion and inclusion criteria that influenced the data set; (ii) Use of\nvariables in 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13) as input features; (iii) Description of\ndemographic representativeness according to variables in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13)\nincluding, at a minimum, those used as input features in the intervention; and (iv)\nDescription of relevance of training data to intended deployed setting.\n\n• § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(7) Quantitative measures of performance, including: (i) Validity\nof intervention in test data derived from the same source as the initial training data; and\n(v) References to evaluation of use of the intervention on outcomes, if available,\nincluding, bibliographic citations or hyperlinks to evaluations of how well the\nintervention reduced morbidity, mortality, length of stay, or other outcomes.\n\nWe believe that these similarities will reduce compliance burden in three ways. First, an\nentity that develops device software functions that also meet the definition of Predictive DSI\nwould be able to fulfill informational requirements for both FDA and ONC purposes using the\nsame or similar information. Second, an entity that develops device software functions that also\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeet the definition of a Predictive DSI may be eligible to be considered Non-Device CDS\naccording to FDA guidance, if the developer of the Predictive DSI fulfils informational\nrequirements according to Program requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) and § 170.402(b)(4).\n\nSpecifically, we note that the capability to enable a limited set of identified users to select\nevidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) and access source attributes\nfor these DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11)(v) could be the technical mechanism by which technologies\nmeet requirements in section 520I(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act, described as Criterion 4 of the\nFDA CDS guidance. Finally, we believe that burdens will be reduced across entities regulated by\nFDA and ONC because an entity that develops device software functions that also meet the\ndefinition of a Predictive DSI could leverage Program requirements to enable users to select\nPredictive DSIs in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii) and access source attribute information in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v). These capabilities could serve as the technical means to deliver information\nto users about the credibility of the device software function that is necessary for “independent\nreview,” without having to build a parallel technological means to deliver such information.\n\nFor example, for those software functions that are considered non-device CDS, and\ntherefore are not the focus of the FDA’s regulatory oversight, our source attribute requirements\nare complementary to the required factor “intended for the purpose of enabling such healthcare\nprofessional to independently review the basis for such recommendations that such software\npresents so that it is not the intent that such healthcare professional rely primarily on any of such\nrecommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual\npatient” (section 520I(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act). In this case, our requirements are supportive\nof meeting aspects which may be part of determining that a Predictive DSI is not a medical\ndevice and therefore not the focus of the FDA’s oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those CDS software that are medical devices and the focus of the FDA’s oversight,\nwe note our requirements are consistent with best practices and recommendations similarly\nprovided by the FDA. In such cases, as these recommendations are consistent across our\nagencies, we believe that providing such information should not increase burden on developers\nwho may be responsible for meeting both FDA and ONC requirements.\n\nWe note that our authorities and policy objectives for decision support are not identical to\nthose of the FDA, and so the information required for source attributes may not be identical to\nthe information that would enable independent review according to FDA’s guidance and\ndetermination, and that the inverse is also true. For instance, we have included source attributes\nrelated to the determination of fairness, as well as measures of local validation pursuant to the\npurposes enumerated in 42 U.S.C. § 300jj–11(b)(11) and (4) to support development of a\nnationwide health information technology infrastructure that improves efforts to reduce health\ndisparities and that provides appropriate information to help guide medical decisions at the time\nand place of care, respectively, but the FDA CDS guidance did not explicitly describe measures\nrelated to fairness or local validation in their description of independent review. We note that a\ndetermination regarding information necessary for independent review lies with, and would\ncontinue to lie with, the FDA.\n\nBeyond the FDA CDS guidance, we note alignment with several categories of source\nattribute information in the finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) and IRM practices described in §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi) across other FDA guidance documents including the FDA’s draft guidance on\nMarketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Device Software Functions (PCCP-ML guidance)<sup>122</sup>\nand the FDA’s guidance on\nContent of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions. We also note important\ndifferences between these requirements and FDA guidance, which highlights our complementary\n– yet distinct – regulatory authorities. Specifically, we highlight that the source attributes for\nongoing maintenance of intervention implementation and use in the finalized §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8) are similar to information described within FDA’s PCCP-ML draft\nguidance. However, specific emphases for fairness measures in local data (at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(iv)) and descriptions of the frequency by which the intervention’s\nperformance is corrected when risks related to validity and fairness are identified (at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(9)(ii)) are not requirements of the FDA’s PCCP-ML draft guidance. We\nalso note that our source attribute information pertains to an expanded set of technologies\nbecause it is not limited to Predictive DSI that are unlocked or those that developers intend to\nmodify over time. Our scope for technology that meets the definition of Predictive DSI is more\nexpansive than what the PCCP-ML guidance considers because we view transparency into the\nperformance of Predictive DSIs in a local health system or clinic to be particularly important to\nusers to determine if a given Predictive DSI is fit for use on or with their patients, particularly in\nthe case of older Predictive DSI that are rarely retrained based on local data. We believe that\nensuring certified health IT has a place to provide this information, or indicate its omission, will\nbe of value to users deciding on whether a technology is fit-for-purpose at their organization, but\nmay be beyond the scope of FDA’s review and approval process.\n\n\nFootnote 122:\nSee https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/marketing-submission-\nrecommendations-predetermined-change-control-plan-artificial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar examples exist in what FDA describes in its Premarket Submissions for Device\nSoftware Functions guidance, including documentation recommendations related to “software\ndescription,” which align with ONC final requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(1) for details\nand output of the intervention and § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(4) for intervention development\ndetails and input features, as well as FDA guidance for a “risk management file,” which aligns\nwith requirements in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) for summary risk management information to be\navailable via publicly accessible hyperlink. We believe that these similarities will reduce the\nburden on complying with our Program requirements for those Predictive DSI that have device\nsoftware functions.\n\nWe are aware that some Predictive DSI may not be within FDA’s purview because,\nconsistent with the history of our Program, we have not focused requirements for DSIs on\nspecific use cases. Thus, we believe that ONC is well positioned to regulate certified health IT in\nways that are different from how FDA regulates device software functions and disagree with\ncommenters’ suggestion that more effective regulation of source attributes could be\naccomplished by the FDA, or that there is conflict between FDA labeling requirements and\nsource attributes, because we have different authorities and, where similar requirements may be\nneeded within these differing scopes, our agencies have worked closely to ensure complementary\nrecommendations and requirements. These technologies, especially in the aggregate, impact how\nhealthcare is delivered, and we believe our complementary authorities will provide important\nbenefits to users.\n\nComment. Several commenters expressed concern that the list of required source\nattributes that must be disclosed is overly broad and potentially impractical to implement.\n\nCommenters requested clarity regarding how DSI developers would satisfy the proposed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirement of providing access of source attributes to an end user and how that information\nwould need to be presented or formatted. They further noted the concern that providing access to\nusers of such broad source attribute information could result in an interface that impairs\nphysician usability. Another commenter suggested that the health IT developers should be\nrequired to instead provide a configuration option through which third-party vendors of\nPredictive DSI could include their source attributes during the integration with health IT or\nimplementation within a hospitals or provider’s database. Another commenter suggested that the\nhealth IT developers should be required to instead provide a configuration option through which\nthird-party vendors of Predictive DSI could include their source attributes during the integration\nwith health IT or implementation within a hospitals or provider’s database.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate comments regarding implementation of our source attributes\nrequirements for user review and implications for usability. While our proposals required a\nHealth IT Module to enable users to review source attribute information, we did not specify\neither that a user must review source attribute information or that source attribute information be\npresented at a specific time or manner to a user. We noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we\nunderstood that source attribute information may be presented in varied ways at various points of\nworkflow and contain varying levels of detail and do not intend to limit the options by which this\ninformation can be made available (88 FR 23788). We also said, consistent with prior ONC\ndiscussion related to existing § 170.315(a)(9)(v) requirements for source attributes (77 FR\n54215), the proposal would not require the automatic display of source attributes information\nwhen a recommendation, alert, or other decision support output is presented that resulted from a\nDSI (88 FR 23788). Last, we noted that we were not aware of widely agreed upon best practices\nfor the format in which this source attribute information should be displayed. However, we are\n\n\n\n\n\n\naware of industry efforts to standardize a format to display information about technology in the\nform of a “model card” or “nutritional label” for healthcare (88 FR 23794). We believe that\nrather than prescribing uniform presentation of this kind of information, that developers of\ncertified health IT should work with their customers to determine the best format and structure of\nsource attribute information. Finally, we note that we did not prescribe a mechanism, standard, or\nprocess for how developers of certified health IT should receive or acquire information from\nother parties for source attributes in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and have also not done so in this\nfinal rule.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern that our proposal would require\nhealth IT developers with certified health IT to regulate other developer’s Predictive DSI and\nstated that health IT developers should not be responsible for the Predictive DSI of their\ncustomers or other parties and that health IT developers’ certification should not be contingent\non other parties providing information to the developer.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their concerns. As described elsewhere in this\nfinal rule, we have adopted modified final rule requirements and a reduced scope to address these\nconcerns. Specifically, we have finalized a different scope with respect to other party source\nattributes, such that developers of certified Health IT are only required to make source attribute\ninformation available when the health IT developer supplies the other party’s Predictive DSI as\npart of its Health IT Module. In alignment with the comments, the finalized requirements of §\n170.315(b)(11) do not extend to developers of certified health IT being accountable for\nPredictive DSIs developed by their customers or other party Predictive DSIs implemented by\ntheir customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that the proposal will not be effective at\ncreating broad, uniform transparency throughout the Predictive DSI marketplace because ONC\nhas authority to regulate certified health IT, which is only a portion of the predictive model\nmarketplace. The commenter noted that the proposal would create imbalance in the marketplace\nbetween developers of certified health IT and developers of non-certified health IT. The\ncommenter also stated that information from third-party developers will be inconsistent and\nintermittent.\n\n*Response.* We believe that the scope of our definition for Predictive DSI and our\nrequirements for Predictive DSIs supplied by developers of certified health IT are sufficiently\ncalibrated to affect a substantial portion of the DSI marketplace and that developers of certified\nhealth IT are well-positioned to ensure that information is updated routinely and consistently for\nPredictive DSI they supply as part of their health IT.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that our proposals would result in\ninefficiencies for developers, and that transparency goals would be more efficiently achieved\nthrough regulations that directly apply to creators of clinical decision alert content. They noted\nthat in some cases that would be those developing EHRs, but in most instances, those creating\nalerts are either third-party businesses or health care providers themselves.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenter that there is a growing market for DSIs created\nby other parties, which could include third-party businesses or health care providers using\ncertified health IT. While we have not finalized our proposals to require developers of certified\nhealth IT to indicate when source attributes are missing for all other party-developed Predictive\nDSIs, we have finalized that a developer of certified health IT must complete and keep current\ndescriptions of source attribute information as specified in § 170.402 (b)(4) for all interventions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplied by the health IT developer, including other party interventions the health IT developer\nsupplies as part of its Health IT Module. We believe this scope appropriately focuses on what a\ndeveloper of certified health IT can readily and efficiently access in terms of source attribute\ninformation. We also finalize that for source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6);\n(b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(iii), (iv), and (v); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(ii) and (iv); and (b)(11)(iv)(B)(9) a health IT\ndeveloper must indicate when information is not available for review. This requirement pertains\nto both source attributes related to Predictive DSIs authored by the developer of certified health\nIT and to Predictive DSIs developed by other parties that are supplied by the developer as part of\nits Health IT Module.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters requested that we clarify that the certification\nrequirements for developers of certified health IT do not convey an obligation for health care\nproviders to review all the source attributes of a DSI each time they choose to use a tool.\n\n*Response.* Nothing in our proposals nor this final rule would compel a user of certified\nhealth IT to review source attributes. However, we note it would be a best practice for users to\nconduct such affirmative reviews in an effort to identify potentially discriminatory tools, as\ndiscriminatory outcomes may violate applicable civil rights law.<sup>123</sup>\n\n\nFootnote 123:\nSee U.S. Dept of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4,\n2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-\nand-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English\nproficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, or disability in certain health programs or\nactivities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.

We believe that recent scrutiny of other predictive models has shown that those\nmodels can similarly present substantial risk if presented without this information. We note that\nmost of our source attributes are specific to Predictive DSIs, which encompasses AI and machine\nlearning algorithms. We have only amended existing requirements for evidence-based DSIs by\nasking for specific data elements to be identified when used by the DSI, including race, ethnicity,\nlanguage, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, date of birth, SDOH, sexual orientation, and\nhealth assessments data elements (e.g., disability status).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters applauded HHS’s efforts to recognize the challenges of\ncomplex predictive models and the general need for public disclosure of source data to determine\nreliability. Commenters also encouraged HHS to consider additional measures to oversee the\nexplainability of the data output and for HHS to adopt broad policies that ensure public access to\nboth models and their data sources. One commenter stated that they believed that the information\n12101 et seq. (prohibiting disability discrimination by employers, state and local government entities, and businesses\nthat are open to the public, among others).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npresented under “source attributes” should be in the public domain and not just presented to end\nusers, and information about which datasets were used to train and evaluate a DSI should be in\nthe public domain and added to the required “source attributes.”\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. However, we decline to consider\nadditional measures regarding the concept of “explainability,” at this time and instead we include\na requirement for risks related to intelligibility to be analyzed and mitigated at §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi). We also appreciate the feedback regarding the value of making public the\ninformation we are requiring for source attributes. We view access to source attribute\ninformation as a necessary step for users of Predictive DSIs to determine the quality of\nPredictive DSIs they use. We decline to require public disclosure of source attribute information\nat this time. Rather, we believe that it is vital to implement the policies that we have finalized in\nthis rule, learn from their implementation, and revisit ways to improve transparency over time.\n\nAs the industry as a whole gains experience with making source attributes available to users of\nPredictive DSIs, we may consider broader and public availability of source attribute information\nin future rulemakings.\n\nMeanwhile, we remind interested parties that under current Program requirements related\nto the Communications Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.403\nusers have explicit rights to discuss publicly various aspects regarding the performance of\ncertified health IT. Specifically, we note that in § 170.403(a)(1)(iv) users have the right to\ndescribe relevant information regarding their experiences when using a Health IT Module. We\nalso noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that algorithms would be considered “non-user-\nfacing aspects of health IT” as they are not readily apparent to persons using health IT for the\npurpose for which it was purchased or obtained (85 FR 25731). Thus, communications regarding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalgorithms (e.g., mathematical methods and logic) could be restricted or prohibited, while\ncommunications regarding the output of the algorithm and how it is displayed in a health IT\nsystem could not be restricted as “non-user-facing aspects of health IT.” Given this, we note that\nsource attribute information is user-facing and is relevant to a user’s experience using certified\nhealth IT. Thus, source attribute information is among the kinds of information that customers\nmay freely discuss publicly.\n\nWe also note our discussion in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule regarding an individual’s ability\nto obtain information about any use of a Predictive DSI—or other emerging technologies—in\ntheir healthcare through the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual's right of access (88 FR 23795).<sup>124</sup>\nIn many cases, developers of certified health IT serve as HIPAA business associates to\ntheir covered entity customers, such as health care providers or health plans.<sup>125</sup>\nIf an individual\nrequests access to their health information from a HIPAA covered entity (e.g., a health care\nprovider that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with an HHS adopted\nstandard transaction) that individual, generally, has a right to access medical and health\ninformation (protected health information (PHI)) about themselves in one or more designated\nrecord sets (DRS) maintained by or for the individual’s HIPAA covered entity.<sup>126</sup>\nThe DRS\ncould include underlying data and information used to generate recommendations about an\nindividual’s healthcare, such as information about the use of a Predictive DSI in a healthcare\n\n\nFootnote 124:\n45 CFR 164.524.\n\n\nFootnote 125:\nSee definitions of “business associate” and “covered entity” at 45 CFR 160.103.\n\n\nFootnote 126:\nFor more information about the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual’s right of access, see OCR’s HIPAA Access\nGuidance: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision and source attribute information associated with use of a Predictive DSI in a healthcare\ndecision.<sup>127</sup>\nComments. One commenter agreed that developers should implement practices and\nprocesses when a model’s performance is inconsistent with its intended use and recommended\nthat we include in regulations a specific process for developers to follow. Another commenter\nrecommended including “identification of intended user qualifications.”\n\n*Response.* We agree with commenters that developers should implement processes to\nupdate models and have included relevant source attributes describing the process of updating\nmodels at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8) and (9). However, we decline to specify a process by\nwhich this is performed because it is likely to vary across Predictive DSI. Information on\nintended user qualifications would be appropriately included at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(2)(iii)\n“intended users,” but we do not explicitly require such information to be there.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested that DSIs based on studies or recommendations\nfrom Federal Agencies should be exempt from any other reporting requirements other than\nidentifying the Agency and the study.\n\n*Response.* We decline to exempt any DSIs described in § 170.315(b)(11) from any of the\napplicable reporting requirements based on where the recommendations originate. We believe\nthat recommendations from a federal agency, such as the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, should include all the source attributes, not only the bibliographic citation, as is\n\n\nFootnote 127:\nSee, e.g., OCR's HIPAA FAQs 2048 and 2049, https://www.hhs.gov/guidance/document/faq-2048-does-\nindividual-have-right-access-genomic-information-generated-clinical; https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-\nprofessionals/faq/2049/does-an-individual-have-a-right-\nunder/index.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20HIPAA%20Privacy%20Rule,a%20clinical%20laboratory%20may%20\nhold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuggested by the commenter. For the same reason that transparency would be helpful for any\nevidence-based DSI, so too would transparency be valuable for DSIs based on studies or\nrecommendations from federal agencies.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters supported the FAVES framework described in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule, noting that these concepts reflect a consensus view of the characteristics\nof high-quality Predictive DSIs. One commenter expressed concern that the effectiveness in\nregulating source attributes would be hampered by reliance on highly defined input fields which\ncan be made subject to political analysis (e.g., FAVES) and related noncomputational tests to\nguide to desired political outcomes, and instead suggested that ONC, rather than focusing on\nredesign of models and model parameters, instead emphasize transparency as to when an AI\nalgorithm is being used.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the many statements of support for our framing of “high-\nquality,” predictive algorithms to mean that such algorithms are fair, appropriate, valid, effective,\nand safe, or FAVES. However, we do not believe a Program requirement for Health IT Modules\nto indicate when an AI algorithm was used to support decision-making is appropriate (as users\nshould already understand if they’re using a predictive AI to support their decision-making) nor\nsufficient for users to understand the quality of such AI algorithms. We believe that defined\nsource attribute categories, coupled with a description of the characteristics that make up a high-\nquality Predictive DSI, are necessary to provide consistent information that will more effectively\npromote the use of those Predictive DSI where appropriate. Further, we note that while we have\ndefined input fields, we have not established requirements for specific measures or identified\nspecific thresholds for content that is related to those categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters encouraged ONC to work with interested parties to\nfurther develop guidance and standards. Specifically, one commenter urged ONC and HHS to\nconvene interested parties to develop a consensus set of meta-data that should and, must be,\ntransparently provided by DSI developers, and strongly supported ONC requiring a standard\nrepresenting a Structure Product Label for Predictive Decision Support. One commenter\nencouraged additional regulatory parameters and encouraged ONC to consider requirements for\nregular, algorithmic impact assessments that analyze data sets, biases, and how users interact\nwith the systems, and the overall design and monitoring of system outputs, as well as to include\nexpressly incorporating data-set best practices and data standards requirements.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and will continue to collaborate with interested\nparties inside and outside of government to ensure that information resulting from our\ntransparency requirements is meaningful for patient care and decision-making.\n\nGiven the comments received from a range of interested parties, and to clarify the scope\nof information required for an applicable Predictive DSI, we have finalized our proposals in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) with modification. We note that the information required here as source\nattribute information is similar to the “meta-data” described by commenters. First, rather than\ninclude references to evidence-based source attributes as proposed, we have added new\nsubparagraphs as part of the “Intervention details” source attribute at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(1)\nto include similar general attribute information. Specifically, at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(1)(i) we\nrequire “The name and contact information for the developer of the intervention,” and at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(1)(ii) we require “Funding source of the intervention,” which are\nsubstantially similar to the proposed inclusion of bibliographic information (since citations\ninclude the name and contact information for corresponding authors) and “developer of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintervention and “Funding source of the intervention” is directly parallel to “Funding source of\nthe intervention development technical implementation” all of which we proposed to apply to\nPredictive DSIs in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. Commenters noted, and we agree, that\nbibliographic citation of the intervention finalized at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(1) likely would not\nbe relevant for all Predictive DSIs and other source attributes specific to evidence-based DSIs at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) were duplicative of source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B).\n\nSecond, we have made explicit in regulation text several requirements described in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule’s preamble to ensure that health IT developers clearly understand the\nsource attribute requirements applicable to Health IT Modules presented for certification to §\n170.315(b)(11). We have finalized these requirements to address many commenters’ concerns\nregarding proprietary information and to help convey at what level of detail Predictive DSI\nsource attributes should be available for a limited set of identified users to record, change, and\naccess.\n\n*Comments.* We received numerous comments from interested parties indicating that more\nclarity was needed to help communicate the scope and detail of information included as source\nattributes in what is now finalized at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B).\n\n*Response.* We agree and have finalized regulation text at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B) to\nclarify the scope and detail of information required to be available for user review. We note that\nthese explicit requirements in regulation text mirror the requirements described previously in\npreamble or represent a subset of requirements previously described in preamble. We also\nreiterate our preamble discussion that the requirements do not require disclosing or sharing IP or\nproprietary information existing in the developer's health IT, including other parties’ IP and\nproprietary information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention Details\nWe proposed three source attributes related to details of predictive models and their\nproper use in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C)(1) “Intervention Details,” Including “Output of the\nintervention,” “Intended use of the intervention,” and “Cautioned out-of-scope use of the\nintervention.” We refer readers to 88 FR 23789–23790 for a detailed discussion of our proposed\nrationale for these source attributes as well as examples and additional instruction, which we\nhave made explicit in the regulation text below.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(1) as follows: “Details and output of the\nintervention, including: (i) Name and contact information for the intervention developer; (ii)\nFunding source of the technical implementation for the intervention(s) development (for which\nwe have modified the wording order from the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to make the source attribute\nread clearer and we have also made this corresponding change for evidence-based DSIs as well);\n(iii) Description of value that the intervention produces as an output; and (iv) Whether the\nintervention output is a prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, analysis, or other\ntype of output.”\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(2) “Purpose of the intervention, including: (i)\nIntended use of the intervention; (ii) Intended patient population(s) for the intervention’s use;\n(iii) Intended user(s); and (iv) Intended decision-making role for which the intervention was\ndesigned to be used/for (e.g., informs, augments, replaces clinical management).”\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(3) as follows “Cautioned out-of-scope use of\nthe intervention, including: (i) Description of tasks, situations, or populations where a user is\ncautioned against applying the intervention; (ii) and Known risks, inappropriate settings,\ninappropriate uses, or known limitations.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention Development\nWe proposed at 88 FR 23790 three source attributes related to model development in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C)(2), “Intervention Development,” including “Input features of the\nintervention including description of training and test data,” “Process used to ensure fairness in\ndevelopment of the intervention,” and “External validation process, if available.” We refer\nreaders to 88 FR 23790–23795 for a detailed discussion of these source attributes in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(4) as follows “Intervention development\ndetails and input features, including at a minimum: (i) Exclusion and inclusion criteria that\ninfluenced the data set; (ii) Use of variables in 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(5)-(13) as input features;\n(iii) Description of demographic representativeness according to variables in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13) including, at a minimum, those used as input features in the\nintervention; and (iv) Description of relevance of training data to intended deployed setting.”\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(5) as follows “Process used to ensure fairness\nin development of the intervention, including: (i) Description of the approach the intervention\ndeveloper has taken to ensure that the intervention’s output is fair; and (ii) Description of\napproaches to manage, reduce, or eliminate bias.”\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6) as follows “External validation process\nincluding: (i) Description of the source, clinical setting, or environment where an intervention’s\nvalidity and fairness has been assessed, other than the source training and testing data; (ii) Party\nthat conducted the external testing; Description of demographic representativeness of external\ndata according to variables in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5)-(13) including, at a minimum, those\nused as input features in the intervention; and Description of external validation process.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative Measures of Intervention Performance\nWe proposed at 88 FR 23791–23792, five source attributes relevant to validation or\nevaluation of the performance (including accuracy, validity, and fairness) of the predictive model\nand evaluation of its effectiveness in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C)(3) “Quantitative measures of\nIntervention Performance,” including “Validity of prediction in test data,” “Fairness of\nprediction in test data,” “Validity of prediction in external data, if available,” “Fairness of\nprediction in external data, if available,” and “References to evaluation of use of the model on\noutcomes, if available.” Together, these source attributes were intended to be a presentation of\nthe measure or set of measures related to the model’s validity (often referred to as performance)\nand fairness when tested in data derived from the same source as the initial training data as well\nas when tested in data external to—that is, from a different source than—the primary training\ndata. “References to evaluation of use of the model on outcomes, if available,” are bibliographic\ncitations or links to evaluations of how well the intervention, or model on which it is based\naccomplished specific objectives such as reduced morbidity, mortality, length of stay or other\nimportant outcomes.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(7) as follows “Quantitative measures of\nperformance, including: (i) Validity of intervention in test data derived from the same source as\nthe initial training data; (ii) Fairness of intervention in test data derived from the same source as\nthe initial training data; (iii) Validity of intervention in data external to or from a different source\nthan the initial training data; (iv) Fairness of intervention in data external to or from a different\nsource than the initial training data; and (v) References to evaluation of use of the intervention on\noutcomes, including, bibliographic citations or hyperlinks to evaluations of how well the\nintervention reduced morbidity, mortality, length of stay, or other important outcomes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing Maintenance of Intervention Implementation and Use\nAt 88 FR 23792, we proposed three source attributes related to the “ongoing maintenance\nof intervention implementation and use,” including, “Update and continued validation or fairness\nassessment schedule,” “Validity of prediction in local data, if available,” and “Fairness of\nprediction in local data, if available.” These source attributes were a description of the process\nand frequency by which the model’s performance is measured and monitored in the local\nenvironment and corrected when risks related to validity and fairness are identified.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8) as follows “Ongoing maintenance of\nintervention implementation and use, including: (i) Description of the process and frequency by\nwhich the intervention’s validity is monitored over time; (ii) Validity of intervention in local\ndata; (iii) Description of the process and frequency by which the intervention’s fairness is\nmonitored over time; and (iv) Fairness of intervention in local data.”\n\nUpdate and Continued Validation or Fairness Assessment Schedule\nAt 88 FR 23792 we proposed a source attribute, “Update and continued validation or\nfairness assessment schedule” and described it as including “the process and frequency by which\nthe model's performance is measured and monitored in the local environment and corrected when\nrisks related to validity and fairness are identified.” Information from this attribute is important\nto assess whether the model is up to date or may reflect outdated trends.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(9) as follows “Update and continued\nvalidation or fairness assessment schedule, including: (i) Description of process and frequency\nby which the intervention is updated; and (ii) Description of frequency by which the\nintervention’s performance is corrected when risks related to validity and fairness are identified.”\n\n\n",

                      "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 88 FR 23795–23796 we proposed that a Health IT Module certified § 170.315(b)(11)\nwould need to clearly indicate when a source attribute listed is not available for the user to\nreview, including in two specific circumstances. First, we proposed that for source attributes that\ninclude the “if available” phrase, a Health IT Module must clearly indicate when such source\nattribute is not available for review. Second, we proposed that when a Health IT Module enables\nor interfaces with a DSI developed by other parties that are not developers of certified health IT,\nthat Health IT Module must clearly indicate when any source attribute is not available for the\nuser to review. We explained that this meant that a Health IT Module that supports a DSI\ndeveloped by other parties that are not developers of certified health IT would have needed to\nclearly indicate when any attribute listed is not available for the user to review, regardless of\nwhether the DSI is a Predictive DSI, as defined at § 170.102, or an evidence-based DSI.\n\nAt 88 FR 23796, we clarified that “other parties,” as used in our proposal, included any\nparty that develops a DSI, a model, or an algorithm that is used by a DSI and is not a developer\nof certified health IT. These could include, but were not limited to: a customer of the developer\nof certified health IT, such as an individual health care provider, provider group, hospital, health\nsystem, academic medical center, or integrated delivery network; a third-party software\ndeveloper, such as those that publish or sell medical content or literature used by a DSI; or\nresearchers and data scientists, such as those who develop a model or algorithm that is used by a\nDSI.\n\nWe reiterated that while we did not prescribe how a certified Health IT Module would\nneed to indicate that an attribute was missing that the certified Health IT Module would need to\ncommunicate an attribute was missing unambiguously and in a conspicuous manner to a user.\n\nWe noted that these “other parties” may or may not have a contractual relationship with the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeveloper of certified health IT. However, we sought comment on whether we should require\ndevelopers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface with Predictive\nDSIs to display source attributes for other parties with which the developer of certified health IT\nhas a contractual relationship.\n\n*Comments.* We received mixed comments supporting and opposing our proposal to\nrequire a Health IT Module to clearly indicate when a source attribute is not available for the\nuser to review. Among those who opposed our proposal, they conveyed that indicating to a user\nwhen a source attribute was unavailable would create burdens on health IT developers who do\nnot readily have access to source attribute information and would position health IT developers\nto enforce information gathering requirements on other companies, including third-party vendors\nwith which the health IT developer has no formal contract and health IT customers that create\nclinical decision support data. Many commenters who opposed this proposal supported an\nalternative requirement that would require certified developers to (1) provide source attributes\nand indicate when information was missing for those interventions they themselves authored\n(i.e., self-developed interventions) and (2) for those interventions that were developed by other\nparties with which the developer of certified health IT worked to implement into their Health IT\nModules as opposed to all other parties, regardless of the health IT developer’s relationship with\nthose other parties. In other words, commenters suggested limiting the transparency requirement\nto those other parties the health IT developer has a contractual relationship with or to require\nhealth IT developers to include functionality to display the information and letting their\ncustomers decide whether to display information about their own Predictive DSI or that of other\ndevelopers with whom the customers have a contractual relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns. We agree with commenters\nregarding the burden and implementation issues associated with identifying missing information\nas we proposed and have made changes to the scope in response. In particular, we have\naddressed the concerns raised about Predictive DSIs developed by other parties with which the\ndeveloper of certified health IT has no formal relationship. The finalized policy, described below\nmore closely aligns with the commenters’ alternative policy, which we believe addresses these\nconcerns.\n\nWhile we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that missing source attribute information\nwould be foundational for users' understanding of the DSI regardless of whether the intervention\ndeveloper was a developer of certified health IT, a customer of the developer of certified health\nIT, an academic health system, integrated delivery network, a third-party software developer, or\nother party (88 FR 23795), we also acknowledged that we understood there may be\ncircumstances where a developer of certified health IT may not have information pertaining to a\nsource attribute for a Health IT Module to enable such user review.\n\nIn response to public comments received, we have made two overall adjustments. First,\nwe did not finalize our proposals for missing source attributes as it relates to other parties as\nproposed. This is because, as discussed elsewhere in this section, we have constrained the overall\nscope of the certification criterion and the developer of the certified Health IT Module’s\naccountability to those Predictive DSIs supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health\nIT Module. As a result, in circumstances where a developer of certified health IT has not\nsupplied an other party’s Predictive DSI as part of its Health IT Module the developer is not\naccountable for the unavailability of those Predictive DSI’s source attribute information. Second,\nwe have finalized a certification requirement for Health IT Modules to indicate when\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninformation is not available for specific source attributes only. Specifically, we have finalized at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(2) requirements that for Predictive DSIs, a Health IT Module must\nindicate when information is not available for review for source attributes in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(iii), (iv), and (v); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(ii) and (iv); and\n(b)(11)(iv)(B)(9). We note that the implication of this finalized policy is twofold: 1) developers\nof certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must enable a limited\nset of identified users to access complete and up-to-date plain language descriptions for all\nsource attributes, except those listed in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(2); and 2) developers of certified\nhealth IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) must enable such access for\nevidence-based and Predictive DSIs at least when those DSIs are supplied by the health IT\ndeveloper as part of its Health IT Module.\n\nWe are aware that, in some limited circumstances, information for specific source\nattributes related to Predictive DSIs supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT\nModule may not be available nor re-creatable. For example, health IT developers that supply\nPredictive DSIs that use models provided through the peer reviewed literature, such as ASCVD,\neGFR, APACHE IV, and LACE+ models referenced elsewhere in this final rule,<sup>128</sup>\nmay not have\naccess to training data that would allow them to: 1) provide a description of demographic\nrepresentativeness of the training data (§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(4)(iii)); 2) generate measures of\nvalidity in test data derived from the same source as the initial training data (§\n\n\nFootnote 128:\nGoff Jr, David C., et al. “2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the\nAmerican College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.” Circulation\n129.25_suppl_2 (2014): S49–S73.\n\nLevey, Andrew S., et al. \"A more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a\nnew prediction equation.\" Annals of internal medicine 130.6 (1999): 461-470.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(i)); and 3) generate measures of fairness in test data derived from the\nsame source as the initial training data (§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(ii)). In cases where\ninformation is only available through published literature, developers may provide information\nfor these source attributes that indicate that the relevant information is not available and that it\ncannot be replicated. In these cases, we encourage organizations to perform external validation\nof these models and we believe that providing users information on the results of that work will\nbe of high value. We note that where source attribute information is available for Predictive DSIs\nin these scenarios, or where source attribute information can be extrapolated from the literature\n(e.g., intended use, cautioned out-of-scope use, or intended population, etc.) source attribute\ninformation should be accessible and modifiable consistent with requirements in §\n170.315(b)(11)(v).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters that expressed support for this proposal commended our efforts\nand requested we strengthen this provision to require that all source attribute information is\navailable for user review. Some commenters expressed support for the proposal stating that it\nwould send a signal to health care providers about the trustworthiness of a DSI tool and\nencourage AI developers to be transparent. One commenter expressed concern that our proposal\nwould allow health IT developers to opt-out of reporting information and allowing developers to\nindicate when source attributes are missing should be the exception and not the rule. Another\ncommenter expressed concern that this provision places no limits on how much or what type of\ndata can be missing while still complying with source data transparency requirements and could\nincentivize developers to not provide any data that might show bias or lead to any type of\nnegative conclusion by potential users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. As addressed more fully in the\nresponse directly above, we have made substantial adjustments to the certification criterion’s\nscope and health IT developers accountability expectations. As a result of these changes, we\nhave also addressed commenter concerns that there would be no limit on how much or what type\nof data can be missing. We have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)(2) that only source\nattributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(7)(iii), (iv), and (v); (b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(ii)\nand (iv); and (b)(11)(iv)(B)(9) may be missing and in these circumstances a health IT developer\nmust indicate when information is not available for review.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern that the proposal to require Health IT\nModules to display missing source attributes could result in unfair market dynamics, in which\ndevelopers of certified health IT will make available full and complete source attribute\ninformation for their homegrown or native DSIs while being less inclined to collect and\nmeaningfully display such information from other parties developing and offering Predictive\nDSIs. Several commenters noted that the proposal would not compel third-party creators to\nprovide the information to the health IT developer, or to renegotiate existing contracts to compel\nthe provision of source attributes.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these concerns and suggestions. We did not propose\nand we have not finalized a policy that regulates other parties and this final rule does not compel\nother parties to provide source attribute information to developers of certified health IT. Rather,\nwe believe there is sufficient market-driven motivation for other parties to provide source\nattribute information for Predictive DSIs they author or develop to health care providers who\nseek to use their Predictive DSI’s in addition to any of the ones supplied by a developer of\ncertified health IT as part of its Health IT Module. We believe health IT users are likely to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelop the expectation that information is available through source attributes and trust and\nchoose to use Predictive DSIs that have the information contained in source attributes compared\nto those that do not, which may also create competitive pressure in the market to provide source\nattribute information. For example, the market incentives consumers have when choosing\nbetween vehicles that have complete history reports regarding accident damages, manufacturer\nbuybacks, registration records, odometer readings, and ownership transfers, and those vehicles\nthat do not. We believe similar market incentives will result in more source attribute information\nbeing made available for user review than would be the case absent the requirement to indicate\nwhen source attributes were not available for review.\n\nIn response to the commenter concerned about unfair market dynamics, we note that we\nhave finalized a requirement that Health IT Modules must be capable of displaying source\nattributes from other parties and for users to be able to modify attributes for those Predictive\nDSI. But that is where the finalized requirements stop. With the exception of Predictive DSIs\nauthored by the health IT developer or those it expressly chooses to supply as part of its Health\nIT Module, we have not required health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(b)(11) to receive, acquire, or otherwise produce source attributes related to other party\nDSIs. We encourage those other parties to work with their customers to ensure that source\nattribute information is full and complete, thereby addressing any potentially unfair market\ndynamics.\n\n*Comments.* Another commenter suggested that developer of the other system, at most,\ncould denote if a DSI it interfaces with is in fact a third-party model, thus informing the user of\nthe need to seek out any desired information from the primary developer of the DSI in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* As part of this final rule’s focus on providing information only for Predictive\nDSIs supplied in Health IT Modules, we decline to require that Health IT Modules display or\n“denote” when another system includes a third-party model.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters stated that communicating that a model is third-party is\nsufficient and stated that while the proposed language of saying source attribute information is\n“not available for user review” is both unnecessarily pejorative to the third party and misleading\nto the end user.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(1) that Health IT Modules must\n“Enable a limited set of identified users to record and change source attributes in paragraphs\n(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section,” but have left flexibility to developers of certified health\nIT and their customers to choose if and how to indicate that information is missing, when they\nbelieve doing so is valuable, so that they may avoid pejorative and misleading language.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern with the phrase “other parties” because it\ncould encompass healthcare delivery organizations that self-develop Predictive DSI for “in-\nhouse” use to augment their purchased EHR system and requested an exemption from certain\nrequirements, and that they not be penalized by ONC or their EHR vendor who could pass on\n“costs” to use their “in-house” tools.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their concern. We believe this final rule’s focus\non providing information only for Predictive DSIs supplied by health IT developers in their\nHealth IT Modules will reduce concerns around a need for specific exemptions or that\ndevelopers of certified health IT might pass on costs, since those developers are only likely to\nincur costs for those Predictive DSI they supply. Predictive DSI that a healthcare delivery\n\n\n\n\n\n\norganization self-developed and used to augment their Health IT Module would likely not be\nconsidered supplied by health IT developers.\n\nAs noted previously in this final rule, we have maintained our description of “other\nparties.” For the purposes of the Program, compliance clarity, and distinguishing a health IT\ndeveloper’s own authored and supplied Predictive DSIs from everyone else, we use the phrase\n“other party,” which could include a health care provider who self-develops a Predictive DSI.\n\nThat said, as we have conveyed this final rule’s requirements, being described as an other party\nimposes no specific regulatory compliance requirement.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "At proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(E), we proposed that Health IT Modules certified to\n§ 170.315(b)(11) support the ability for a limited set of identified users to author (i.e., create) and\nrevise source attributes and information provided for user review beyond the specific source\nattributes we enumerated (88 FR 23796–23797). This proposal applied to source attributes\nrelated to both evidence-based DSIs and Predictive DSIs that would be enabled by or interfaced\nwith a certified Health IT Module, including any Predictive DSIs that could have been developed\nby users of the certified Health IT Module, and we described specific examples in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule. While we did not propose to require a developer of certified health IT to be\ndirectly involved in the authoring or revision of source attribute information provided for user\nreview, we proposed that the certified Health IT Module would need to support the technical\nability for a limited set of identified users to create new or revised attribute information\nalongside other source attribute information proposed as part of § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and (C).\n\n*Comments.* A majority of commenters did not support the proposal that Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) support the ability for a limited set of identified users to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthor (i.e., create) and revise source attributes and information provided for user review beyond\nwhat was proposed. One commenter supported the concept of hospitals and providers creating\ntheir own Predictive DSI models and suggested that developers should only be expected to create\nfunctionality to allow users to enter their own source attributes and that developers should not\nhave responsibility for gathering that information for users for input into the products. One\ncommenter expressed concern that it is unclear whether the expectation is that developers must\nallow for customers to revise the source attributes that developers have themselves defined for\nDSIs they have developed, noting that allowing revisions would seem problematic as it could\ninappropriately alter the meaning and information being relayed to end-users. Commenters\nrecommended that we clearly indicate that this requirement applies solely to\nadditional/supplementary source attributes for DSIs developed by the developer of certified\nhealth IT themselves stating that DSIs that are not directly implemented or enabled by the\ndeveloper should be out of scope for the criterion. Commenters were especially concerned that\nthe proposal failed to define the intent for, or characteristics of, the limited set of identified users\nand would enable those users to create extra regulatory requirements for developers of certified\nHealth IT Modules.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and believe that coupled with the proposed scope\nfor the certification criterion that some commenters may have misinterpreted the intent behind\nour proposal and how the technical capabilities for a Health IT Module would play out as part of\nimplementation. We note that several source attributes, particularly those now finalized in §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(6)-(9) pertain to activities that may occur within individual customer sites,\nso that processes to measure validity and fairness, as well as the results of those processes, are\nlikely to differ across customer sites. We believe individual customers will have substantial value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin revising these source attributes. We clarify that developers of certified health IT are not\nresponsible for content recorded, changed, or accessed by these users and are not responsible for\ngathering information for or from users that wish to record or change source attribute\ninformation.\n\nWe nevertheless understand commenters’ concerns related to modification of source\nattributes related to Predictive DSIs that are developed by health IT developers. We clarify that\ndevelopers of certified health IT are not responsible for the accuracy or use of source attribute\ninformation that is modified by their users. Rather, developers of certified health IT are required\nto have Health IT Modules that support the capability for their users to author or revise source\nattribute information. We emphasize that this capability is not dependent on the entity that\ndeveloped the Predictive DSI or related source attributes and we decline to limit this capability to\nonly those additional/supplementary source attributes for DSIs developed by a developer of\ncertified health IT. We note that a Health IT Module is required to enable a “limited set of\nidentified users,” to author and revise source attributes. We believe this stipulation ensures that a\nHealth IT Module is capable of enabling some specified users, but not all users, to have the\ncapability to author and revise source attributes and we believe this mitigates concerns around\ninappropriate alteration. This requirement will not provide these users with the ability to create\nadditional regulatory requirements but simply to display information related to source attributes\nof their choosing. We note that several certification criteria include the phrase “limited set of\nidentified users,” including the CDS criterion at § 170.315(a)(9), which developers of certified\nhealth IT have had more than a decade of experience supporting.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters did not agree with the proposal that Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11) support the ability for a limited set of identified users to author (i.e.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate) and revise source attributes and information provided for user review beyond what was\nproposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and (C). These commenters noted that it could be\nburdensome on device manufactures, be at odds with FDA device requirements, adulterate the\nfunctionality of the device, and could possibly invalidate any testing and validity provided by the\ndevelopers or require such robust testing for all permutations that quality and cost could be\nimpacted. Commenters were concerned about the impact on FDA approved devices, observing\nthat allowing third-party developers and users to alter source attribute information, including\ninformation related to the “intended use” of the device, may be considered an alteration to the\ndevice and impact FDA approval.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ concerns regarding FDA-approved medical\ndevices and alterations to the devices intended use source attribute. We note that the source\nattribute related to intended use is a description of what the output of the Predictive DSI should\nbe used for and not a bound indication of what a devices may be approved to do. While we do\nnot expect users to change the intended use of a Predictive DSI, the requirement is that a Health\nIT Module enable a limited set of users to change and record source attribute information. We\nbelieve that developers of certified health IT and their customers are best positioned to jointly\ndecide how broadly to provide the ability to change and record source attributes and under what\ncircumstances. Customers could then decide what set of users should have the ability to record\nand change source attribute information in the capabilities adopted in final §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B). In many cases, we believe that FDA requirements and the\ninformation included as source attributes are closely aligned, limiting burden on developers.\n\nWhere that is not the case, we believe the information provided as source attributes will have\nsubstantial values to users commensurate with implied burden. Though required, developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcerned about changes to their original source attribute information are free to include a\ncapability to allow users to review the original source attributes even when the information has\nbeen changed by end users.\n\nWe have finalized our requirements related to revising source attribute information with\nmodifications at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(1), which requires that a Health IT Module must enable\na limited set of identified users to record and change source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)\nand (b)(11)(iv)(B). As previously discussed, § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B) is a modified version of\nproposed § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) and § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(E), combining the “author and revise”\nconcepts of § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(E) with the “review” concept in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv). In\nfinalizing this language, we intend to clearly convey that individuals can record and change\ninformation within the source attributes listed at § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (b)(11)(iv)(B).\n\nWe are also aware of substantial activity by the public, industry groups, and other\nadvocacy organizations to further transparency related to Predictive DSIs. Along those lines, we\nhave observed that variations exist with respect to each initiative’s priorities and that there is not\nstrong consensus among these groups related to the information included as source attributes or\ntransparency information.<sup>129</sup>\nAs technology related to Predictive DSIs continues to evolve and as\nindustry consensus matures, we expect that new information may need to be made available\nthrough source attributes for new models. In recognition of the fact that this final rule now sets a\nconsistent, industry-wide baseline set of source attributes on which these groups may wish to\nbuild, we have retained a requirement at § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(2) around authoring source\nattributes in addition to those listed in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B). This capability will help support\n\n\nFootnote 129:\nSee, for instance, work by the coalition for health AI https://www.coalitionforhealthai.org/ and the health AI\npartnership https://healthaipartnership.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth care providers who wish to stay at pace with industry consensus around transparency and\ninclude additional source attribute information using their certified health IT to do so.\n\nIn § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B)(2) we have finalized that for Predictive DSIs, the Health IT\nModule must enable a limited set of identified users to record, change, and access additional\nsource attribute information not specified in paragraph (b)(11)(iv)(B). First, we have limited this\ncapability to only Predictive DSI source attributes in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B), whereas our\nproposal applied to both evidence-based and Predictive DSIs. This is intended to be responsive\nto commenters who worried that the scope of this capability was too burdensome to implement.\n\nSecond, we have modified the capability from “author and revise source attributes beyond those\nlisted” to the capability to “record, change, and access additional source attribute information not\nspecified.” We believe this more clearly articulates the intent of the policy and addresses\nconcerns regarding questions posed by interested parties on what “beyond,” meant within the\ncontext of their obligations. We clarify that developers of certified Health IT Modules are not\nresponsible for the content recorded, changed, or accessed by these users.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "Decision Support Interventions\nAt 88 FR 23797–23808, we proposed to establish “intervention risk management” (IRM)\nrequirements. We proposed at 88 FR 23797 to require that by December 31, 2024, a developer of\ncertified health IT that attested “yes” as part of our other proposal would need to employ or\nengage in certain IRM practices for all Predictive DSIs, as we proposed at 88 FR 23785 to define\nin § 170.102, that the developer’s certified Health IT Module enables or interfaces with. We also\nproposed that developers of certified health IT analyze potential risks and adverse impacts\nassociated with a Predictive DSI for the following characteristics: validity, reliability, robustness,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfairness, intelligibility, safety, security, and privacy at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A)(1) (88 FR\n23799–23801). Similarly, we proposed that developers of certified health IT implement practices\nto mitigate risks associated with intervention Predictive DSIs at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A)(2) (88\nFR 23801 - 23802). And, related to governance, we proposed that developers of certified health\nIT would need to establish policies and implement controls for Predictive DSI governance,\nincluding how data are acquired, managed, and used in a Predictive DSI at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A)(3) (88 FR 23802–23803).\n\nWith respect to documentation, we proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(B) that developers\nof certified health IT compile detailed documentation of IRM practices and upon request from\nONC make available such detailed documentation for any Predictive DSI that their certified\nHealth IT Module enables or interfaces with (88 FR 23803 – 23804). We also proposed at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C) to require developers of certified health IT to submit summary\ninformation to their ONC-ACB regarding IRM practices listed via a publicly accessible\nhyperlink that would allow any person to directly access the information without any\npreconditions or additional steps (88 FR 23804). Consistent with Program implementation for\nsimilar documentation requirements (84 FR 7484), we proposed that for this proposed summary\ninformation, the required documentation would need to be submitted to ONC-ACBs for review\nprior to issuing a certification (88 FR 23805).\n\nFinally, we proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D) to require that developers of certified\nhealth IT review annually and, as necessary, update both detailed documentation and summary\ninformation associated with the certification criterion (88 FR 23805). We also proposed to\nestablish a deadline of December 31, 2024, for developers of certified health IT with Health IT\nModules to which the proposed requirements in that section apply to engage in IRM practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand develop both detailed documentation and summary information (88 FR 23797). This\nproposed deadline corresponded with other proposals in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, including our\nproposed to update the Base EHR definition (88 FR 23808).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters both supported and opposed our proposed IRM requirements at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii), with those in support noting the proposed risk management practices of\nrisk analysis, risk mitigation, and governance are essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of\nPredictive DSIs. One commenter suggested that ONC strengthen its risk analysis requirements to\ninclude intended and reasonably expected DSI use(s), DSI evidence of safety, DSI efficacy, DSI\nlevel of automation, and conditions of DSI deployment, whereas another commenter\nrecommended ONC limit its risk analysis requirements to predictive clinical DSIs. Commenters\nwere especially supportive of our proposal to adopt NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework\n(AI RMF) because they noted the characteristics in the proposal provide a robust framework to\nhelp with risk mitigation.<sup>130</sup>\nSome commenters recommended that we follow the\nCongressionally-created National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC)\nrecommendation to use either the NIST AI RMF or similar processes and policies that align with\nNIST AI RMF. One commenter was supportive to use the NIST Characteristics for FAVES, but\nrecommended revisions to the Fairness, Intelligibility, and Safety characteristics. One\ncommenter who supported the proposal suggested that ONC should strengthen the proposed\nrequirements to explicitly require that a health IT developer’s risk mitigation practice include\nadditional information on addressing bias, safeguarding privacy, security interests, and personal\ninformation, and create a full feedback loop.\n\n\nFootnote 130:\nNIST AI Risk Management Framework, https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and agree that risk management practices are\nessential for ensuring the trustworthiness of Predictive DSIs and that these practices would\npromote transparency and accountability within healthcare. As described further in this section\nwe have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) substantially similar versions of our proposals. The\nfinalized certification criterion requires that IRM practices must be applied for each Predictive\nDSI supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, including risk analysis,\nrisk mitigation, and governance. We have also finalized modified versions of what we proposed\nrelated to IRM summary information in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) as well as the annual review and\nupdated documentation requirements in § 170.402(b)(4). We have not finalized our proposal that\ndevelopers of certified health IT compile detailed documentation of IRM practices listed in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A) and upon request from ONC make available such detailed\ndocumentation for any Predictive DSI that their certified Health IT Module enables or interfaces\nwith.\n\nWe thank commenters for their support of our proposal’s consistency with the NIST AI\nRMF and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) recommendation to use\neither the NIST AI RMF or similar processes and policies that align with the NIST AI RMF.<sup>131</sup>\nWhile we encourage the use of a framework to help facilitate IRM and adapted the NIST AI\nRMF concepts and emphasis areas, conformance with this certification criterion does not require\nthe use of any particular framework, approach, or methodology for providing information about\n\n\nFootnote 131:\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23810) (footnote 289), we are aware of and coordinated with\nmultiple federal agencies and activities focused on AI, including the NAIC, that are also exploring policies to\nprevent and mitigate bias in AI/ML and the intersection with privacy, equity, and civil rights. For more information\nabout the Congressionally-created NAIC and its recommendation for federal agencies, please see the NAIC Year 1\nReport (May 2023), available at: https://www.ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NAIAC-Report-Year1.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrisk management practices. As noted in HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23798), we have left this\nflexibility given a lack of healthcare sector-specific guidance and the nascency of several\nemerging efforts for risk management of predictive software.\n\nWe appreciate commenters’ suggestions on additional characteristics and additional kinds\nof risks that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to\n§ 170.315(b)(11) should include as part of their IRM practices. However, we remained consistent\nwith what we proposed and decline to add further characteristics. We believe that the eight areas\nwe have finalized represent consensus focus areas, are based on the NIST AI RMF, and would be\nmost relevant to Predictive DSIs. We will monitor implementation of this requirement and may\nconsider modifications to these characteristics in future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters not in support of the IRM requirements proposed at §\n170.315(b)(11)(vi), expressed significant concerns that they would require disclosing IP or\nproprietary information, could compromise patient privacy, and increase administrative burdens.\n\nOther commenters did not support the IRM requirements because they thought they were too\nbroad, noting that requiring a developer of certified health IT to perform IRM practices over a\nthird party’s DSI tool is neither feasible or competitively rational and recommended that we limit\nthe scope so that developers are accountable for IRM practices for its own DSI only. Other\ncommenters that did not support the IRM proposals urged ONC to consider a risk-based DSI\napproach that would classify high, moderate, and low risk DSIs and would provide developers\nwith appropriately scaled risk-based controls based on potential harm to individual patients and\npopulations. One commenter expressed concern that some developers may engage in risky\npractices that result in harm or privacy violations and requested more clarity on how certification\ncriteria would exclude developers from engaging in these practices. One commenter expressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcern that there is not enough time for developers to meet the December 31, 2024, deadline\ndue to the time to develop and implement the requirements and requested additional time to\naddress the eight characteristics of risk.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns and suggestions. As we have noted\nthroughout this rulemaking, we believe that such transparency is a prerequisite for high-quality\nPredictive DSIs to be trusted by clinicians, patients, health systems, software developers, and\nother interested parties. When we developed the proposed IRM requirements, we sought a\nbalance between limited prescriptiveness and sufficient detail to enable robust and broadly\napplicable reporting of information on risk management practices to users and the public. Our\nproposed requirements focused on potential risks and adverse impacts (harm) in eight areas, that\ninclude privacy and fairness, that may be associated with each Predictive DSI that is authored by\nthe health IT developer.\n\nIn consideration of the feedback we received, we believe that the finalized IRM\nrequirements strike the best balance, especially given that we have not established requirements\nfor specific measures. Rather, we have given maximum flexibility to developers of certified\nhealth IT to determine which information best fits their unique circumstances and Predictive DSI\nuse cases. We encourage developers of certified health IT to examine industry resources, such as\nthe NIST AI RMF or the Health Equity Across the AI Lifecycle (HEAAL) framework,<sup>132</sup>\nas part\nof these requirements.\n\n\nFootnote 132:\nKim J., Hasan A., Kellogg K., et al. Development and preliminary testing of Health Equity Across the AI\nLifecycle (HEAAL): A framework for healthcare delivery organizations to mitigate the risk of AI solutions\nworsening health inequities. medRxiv 2023.10.16.23297076; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.16.23297076.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, as stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23799), we believe that many such\ndevelopers of certified health IT already employ or engage in IRM practices to comply with\nexisting certification criteria (§ 170.315(g)(3)” safety-enhanced design” (SED) and\n§ 170.315(g)(4) Quality management systems (QMS)). Thus, we continue to believe that the\nfinalized requirement to provide information on these practices represents a low-level of burden\nfor those developers. We believe that our IRM practice requirements are important for several\nreasons. First, all developers of certified health IT that seek certification to § 170.315(b)(11) and\nsupply Predictive DSIs as part of their Health IT Module will become familiar with foundational\nIRM practices. Second, the public disclosure of the summary information of IRM practices\nemployed or engaged by the developer of certified health IT, as described further below, will\nprovide transparency to purchasers (potential users), users, and other interested parties, and\ncontribute to appropriate information to help guide medical decisions. Lastly, our finalized\nrequirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) will encourage development of healthcare-specific,\nconsensus, and industry-based best practices for risk management.\n\nWe appreciate the concerns expressed about IP and proprietary information, patient\ninformation privacy, and administrative burden. As noted, as part of this certification criterion’s\npreamble we have made scope adjustments in response to public comment that we believe\nsubstantially address these concerns. The finalized requirements for risk analysis and risk\nmitigation are limited to only those Predictive DSIs supplied by the developer of health IT as\npart of its Health IT Module. We have also clarified our expectations for governance\nrequirements. With the exception of other party Predictive DSI’s supplied by developers of\nhealth IT as part of their Health IT Module, we have not finalized the proposals (88 FR 23803)\nthat caused commenters’ concerns regarding the developer of certified health IT performing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“IRM practices over a third party’s DSI.” Specifically, we have not finalized that developers\nreview risk management information from other parties nor that developers include risk\nmanagement information from other parties as part of the documentation requirement.\n\nWe appreciate the concern expressed about information privacy and harm. We expect\nthat model developers will use data for training and testing consistent with applicable law,\npatients' expectations, and any patient consent or preference given. We believe the scope changes\nwe have made as part of this finalized certification criterion along with the high degree of\nflexibility we provide to developers of certified health IT to establish appropriate risk\nmanagement practices mitigate concerns related to compromising IP, proprietary information,\nand patient privacy. While we appreciate the concerns raised by some commenters, based on the\nfinal certification criterion’s scope, we believe they are outweighed by the need to promote\ngreater and more meaningful disclosure of information by developers of health IT certified. We\ndisagree with the claims that our requirements for summary information about risk management\npractices would result in disclosing IP or proprietary information as we are entrusting developers\nof certified health IT to disclose information at a level of detail according to their own\njudgments. Furthermore, based on the scope of the final certification criterion, it is reasonable to\nassume that developers of certified health IT are experts on their own products and services and\npossess sophisticated technical and market knowledge related to the implementation and use of\nhealth IT in a variety of settings in which their products are used. Through their accumulated\nexperience developing and providing health IT solutions to their customers, health IT developers\nshould be familiar with the types of risks that most users encounter, and therefore must describe\nthese in sufficient detail to provide potential customers, patients, or researchers, with the\ninformation they need to make informed applicability, scope, and use decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for recommendations that we take a risk-based approach to IRM requirements, we\nappreciate the comment. However, the Program is not predicated on levels of risk and our\nrequirements for certification to the DSI (formerly CDS) criterion has been and continues to be\nagnostic to specific use cases, intended uses, and risks. We reiterate that we are not establishing\nrequirements for specific measures. Rather, we are giving maximum flexibility for developers of\ncertified health IT to determine which information best fits their unique circumstances and\nPredictive DSI use cases.\n\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23802), developers of certified health IT\nhave the flexibility to choose an approach to meeting this requirement that addresses their own\nunique circumstances for their Predictive DSIs. However, we encourage developers to\nimplement policies and controls to evaluate whether risk analysis and risk mitigation practices\nare being carried out as specified; to consider how policies and controls are monitored and\nupdated; and to plan a schedule for updating those policies and controls. Policies and controls\nshould include details on roles, responsibilities, staff expertise, authority, reporting lines, and\ncontinuity. We further encourage developers to have accountability and escalation policies and\ncontrols related to how management oversees the development, deployment, and management of\nPredictive DSIs.<sup>133</sup>\nThese policies and controls should describe the developer of certified health\nIT’s decision-making parameters or programs and include how management is held accountable\nfor the impact of Predictive DSIs. We encourage developers to identify staff that are responsible\nfor Predictive DSIs and related models and to develop policies to hold those staff accountable to\n\n\nFootnote 133:\nOff. Comptroller Currency, Comptroller's Handbook: Model Risk Management (Aug. 2021),\nhttps://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/model-risk-\nmanagement/index-model-risk-management.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe developer’s established policies and procedures.<sup>134</sup>\nWe believe that developers should plan\nescalation processes that permit significant issues with Predictive DSI development, integration,\nor use to reach appropriate levels of management and describe standards for timely resolution of\nissues with Predictive DSIs and related models.<sup>135</sup>\nIf the developer uses a third party to assess\nrisk, the developer should describe processes for determining whether assessments performed by\na third party meet the standards and controls set forth in the developer's governance framework.\n\nWe appreciate the commenter’s concerns about meeting the December 31, 2024,\ndeadline, and the desire for an extension. We note that in prioritizing this certification criterion,\nwe have finalized longer timelines for the adoption of other standards and certification criteria\nwith, for example, a compliance date of January 1, 2026. We believe the extended dates for\nconformance with these other standards and certification criteria will make it more feasible for\nthe industry to meet the December 31, 2024, deadline for the finalized requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11). We discuss timing requirements in more detail below in the section on\nmodifications to the “Base EHR.”\n\nAfter consideration of public comments received, we have finalized with modifications\nour proposed requirements for IRM practices. Specifically, we have finalized in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi) that IRM practices must be applied for each Predictive DSI supplied by the\nhealth IT developer as part of its Health IT Module. This finalized requirement applies to\nPredictive DSIs “supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module,” which\nestablishes an equivalent scoping between what we proposed under the attestation statement in\nproposed § 170.315(b)(11)(v) and what we have finalized in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi). As proposed,\n\n\nFootnote 134:\nId.\n\n\nFootnote 135:\nId.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nonly those developers that attested “yes,” would have had to employ or engage in IRM practices\nand as finalized, only developers that supply Predictive DSIs are required to apply IRM\npractices. We have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) requiring that Predictive DSIs must be\nsubject to analysis of potential risks and adverse impacts associated with the following\ncharacteristics: validity, reliability, robustness, fairness, intelligibility, safety, security, and\nprivacy, which is substantially similar to what we proposed. We have finalized\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(B) requiring that Predictive DSIs must be subject to practices to mitigate\nrisks, identified in accordance with (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, which is substantially similar to\nwhat we proposed. We have finalized § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C) requiring that Predictive DSIs\nmust be subject to policies and implemented controls for governance, including how data are\nacquired, managed, and used, for all Predictive DSIs supplied by the health IT developer as part\nof its Health IT Module, which is substantially similar to what we proposed.\n\nWe have also finalized requirements in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) as part of the Principles of\nProper Conduct for ONC-ACB’s that an ONC-ACB shall, where applicable, ensure that\nsummary information of the IRM practices listed in paragraph § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) is submitted\nby the health IT developer via publicly accessible hyperlink that allows any person to access the\nsummary information directly without any preconditions or additional steps. We have finalized\nthis requirement as a combination of what we proposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C) and what we\nproposed as a modification the Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACB in §\n170.523(f)(1)(xxi)\nFinally, as stated previously, we have finalized a new Assurances Maintenance of\nCertification requirement in § 170.402(b)(4) that requires developers of Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11), starting January 1, 2025, and on an ongoing basis thereafter,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreview and update, as necessary, source attribute information in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A) and (B),\nrisk management practices described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi), and summary information provided\nthrough § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi). This requirement is substantially similar to what we had included\nin our proposal (such as § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D)). We provide additional details on\n§ 170.402(b)(4) in previous comment responses in section III.C.5.v. “Predictive Decision\nSupport Interventions, Attestation for Predictive Decision Support Interventions,” of this final\nrule.\n\nWe reiterate that ONC has not adopted specific risk analysis metrics or risk mitigation\npractices beyond describing eight characteristics in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and we note that\ndevelopers of certified health IT may vary their IRM practices based on their understanding of\nthe risk of each Predictive DSI.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns that the nature of the proposed\ndocumentation required in the IRM disclosure requirements that developers would have to meet\nwould require a third-party developer to share proprietary technical and governance information\nand requested clarification on the level of detail required in documentation that IRM practices\nare employed. One commenter requested clarification on how developers of health IT would\nmeet the proposed documentation requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(B) when they would\nneed to obtain the documentation from third-party developers. Several commenters did not\nsupport our IRM proposals due to the burdens it would place on health IT developers and\nrecommended that we limit the IRM proposals to health IT developers who develop their own\nPredictive DSI models.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns. After consideration of these\ncomments, we have not finalized the requirements described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreamble for developers of certified health IT to receive or have access to risk management\ninformation for Predictive DSIs developed by other parties (and that are not supplied by the\ndeveloper as part of its Health IT Module). After consideration of these comments, we have not\nfinalized the requirements described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23803) preamble for\ndevelopers of certified health IT to receive or have access to risk management information for\nPredictive DSIs developed by other parties (and that are not supplied by the developer as part of\nits Health IT Module). This means there are no expectations that developers review risk\nmanagement information from other parties with whom they have no relationship and with\nwhom they have not expressly chosen to supply a Predictive DSI as part of their Health IT\nModule. This also excludes all other party Predictive DSIs that their customers choose to\nimplement as well as any Predictive DSIs that their customers author.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters believed that developers, and not health care providers,\nshould ultimately be responsible for the tools they create and bear responsibility\nfor harmful outcomes resulting from the tools being used as intended. Whereas other\ncommenters suggested that the responsibility for risk assessment and mitigation should be shared\nwith DSI providers and authors of the toolset, rather than requiring the health IT developers to\naccept all responsibilities.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ concerns. We agree that multiple parties share\nresponsibility for risk assessment and mitigation and the safe application of Predictive DSI, and\nnote that this rule does not alter any party’s responsibility for exercising sound professional\n\n\n\n\n\n\njudgment in making clinical decisions and complying with applicable laws.<sup>136</sup>\nDevelopers and\nhealth care providers should implement practices in full awareness that this final rule will not\nchange their responsibility under other applicable law. We have finalized requirements aligned\nwith our authorities for developers of certified health IT, and we anticipate these requirements\nfor IRM practices will help spur much-needed conversations across providers and their health IT\npartners on how best to analyze, mitigate, and govern risks associated with Predictive DSIs.\n\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we are aware that, in addition to developers of\ncertified health IT, users, such as healthcare organizations and clinicians, have responsibilities\nrelated to Predictive DSIs, including intervention or model risk management during\nimplementation and use, as well as model validation (88 FR 23805). For example, we believe it\nis important that users maintain strong governance and controls to help manage model risk and\nhow they will use outputs from interventions in decision-making, including monitoring any\npotential impacts of model use. Users of a Predictive DSI are also best able to report on how the\n\n\nFootnote 136:\nSee e.g., U.S. Dept of Health & Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\nNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4,\n2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-\nand-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin (including limited English\nproficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, or disability in certain health programs or\nactivities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.

One commenter expressed concern that ONC did not account for the\ndifference between “AI Developers” and “AI Deployers” noting that each has unique and distinct\nroles, and risk analysis requirements should account for these separate roles.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. As we have noted as part of the certification\ncriterion’s discussion throughout this final rule, we have adjusted the scope of the certification\ncriterion and clarified health IT developer responsibilities compared to health care providers and\nother parties. We clarify, based on the scope and policy for the final certification criterion, that\n“DSI tools created by a health care provider” for its own use are not in scope for Program\nrequirements. More to the point, such health care providers will benefit from this final\ncertification criterion’s requirements because updated certified health IT will include more\nsupportive capabilities for DSI transparency that they will be able to use for their own purposes.\n\nWe appreciate the comment for differentiating between “AI Developers” and “AI Deployers,”\nhowever, we decline to establish different IRM practice requirements for different roles that\nmay, or may not, exist across organizational boundaries. Our requirements pertain specifically to\ndevelopers of certified Health IT Modules that supply Predictive DSIs as part of their Health IT\nModule.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern about the potential liability of health\nIT developers and health care providers. One commenter expressed concern that some\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers may attempt to shift liability for poor performing tools and recommended that the\ndeveloper of the tool should bear the responsibility of ensuring optimal performance of the tool\nthey developed and should bear the brunt of the liability when errors occur. One commenter\nrecommended that we strengthen the requirements around IRM practices by requiring developers\nof certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface with Predictive DSIs to\ncarry liability insurance that covers contingent bodily injury due to technology errors and\nomissions.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenter’s concern for liability and accountability. We\nbelieve that our requirements for transparency in both performance, as indicated by the\ninformation required as part of source attributes, and in IRM practices will help users determine\nif tools are poor performing and make subsequent decisions on whether and how to use such\ntools. In general, these comments are outside of the scope of this rulemaking, and we decline to\nrequire liability insurance as part of our requirements and believe that issues of liability are\noutside the scope of this rulemaking. Those concerned or curious about it should reference\nfederal, state, or tribal laws and regulations – or reliable sources information.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that there is no requirement for real world\ntesting in an uncontrolled environment and urged ONC require these activities are tested in real\nworld scenarios before they are adopted to ensure DSIs are successful.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their suggestion to require real world testing of\nPredictive DSIs. We note that among the source attributes listed in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) there are\ntwo that would enable users to know if a Predictive DSI was tested for fairness at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv)(B)(8)(iii) and (iv) and validity in local data at § 170.315(b)(11)(B)(iv)(8)(i)\nand (ii). These source attributes are intended to support such real world testing; however, we are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot requiring that such testing be done, so as noted within the certification criterion these source\nattributes may be missing. We also note that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11)\nmust participate in real world testing as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirement as stipulated in § 170.405.\n\nRisk Analysis\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23798–23799), we proposed to require developers of\ncertified health IT to analyze potential risks and adverse impacts associated with a Predictive\nDSI that their certified Health IT Modules enable or interface with. NIST’s AI RMF describes\nseven characteristics of trustworthy AI, and we proposed to adapt these concepts and require that\ndevelopers of health IT with certified Health IT Modules that enable or interface with Predictive\nDSIs employ or engage in risk management practices related to the following characteristics: (1)\nvalidity; (2) reliability; (3) robustness; (4) fairness; (5) intelligibility; (6) safety; (7) security; and\n(8) privacy. We did not propose or describe risk tolerance associated with the eight\ncharacteristics, as we believe these should be decisions made by those involved with the design,\ndevelopment, deployment, and use of the technology. We proposed that developers of certified\nhealth IT must analyze the potential risks and adverse impacts, associated with a Predictive DSI\nthat their certified Health IT Modules enable or interface with, related to lack or failure in the\neight characteristics.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters were concerned that ONC did not establish or define\nregulatory baselines, measures, or thresholds for what constitutes FAVES for Predictive DSIs\nand noted that providers are not trained to independently assess whether a Predictive DSI was\nFAVES, nor is there a commonly accepted standard for review. Several commenters expressed\nconcern that the IRM proposals could be duplicative of other federal agencies and could create\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconflicting regulatory schemes and urged ONC to consult and collaborate with federal partners\nand build on existing federal efforts to ensure bias, discrimination, and other health equity\nconcerns were addressed through a unified AI government framework. One commenter\nrecommended that the proposed “Safety” characteristic should explicitly exclude FDA-\nauthorized AI and machine learning medical devices because they believe that a risk assessment\nfor these tools is best made by the FDA due to their expertise in medical and clinical safety and\nbeing uniquely positioned to draw conclusions and develop guidelines for the safe and\nappropriate use of AI and machine learning tools.\n\n*Response.* Given the broad uses of Predictive DSIs, ONC did not seek to establish\nspecific baselines, measures, or thresholds for what constitutes FAVES in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule. These measures are likely to vary based on specific technologies and uses of Predictive\nDSI. In many cases, the safety and effectiveness of a software function, including clinical\ndecision support or other kinds of decision support interventions, is within the purview of FDA\nregulatory oversight, when such functionality meets the definition of a “device” under the FD&C\nAct. As previously noted, ONC and FDA support a harmonized and complementary approach to\npredictive technology in accordance with our existing intersecting regulatory oversight. We\nsought to ensure there would be limited, if any, contradictory requirements. We note that we\nhave afforded substantial flexibility to developers in practicing IRM. For tools that have been\nauthorized by the FDA, we believe it would be appropriate for developers to provide information\non FDA authorization as part of the “Safety” characteristic. Furthermore, given the intersecting\ninterest across the Department to address the use of AI in health, we consulted extensively with\nour HHS partners at AHRQ, FDA, and OCR as well as our federal partners at the FTC and VA\nin developing the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to advance our shared goals of promoting greater trust in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive DSIs in healthcare that are fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe to deliver patient\ncare, enable an effective marketplace, and greater competition.<sup>137</sup>\nAfter consideration of these comments, we have finalized requirements at\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) that for each Predictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as part\nof its Health IT Module, the Predictive DSI must be subject to analysis of potential risks and\nadverse impacts associated with Predictive DSI the following characteristics: validity, reliability,\nrobustness, fairness, intelligibility, safety, security, and privacy. We note that we have narrowed\nthe scope of Predictive DSIs for which a developer is expected to analyze risks and adverse\nimpacts to only those Predictive DSIs that are supplied by the health IT developer. As stated\npreviously, this is in response to public comments concerned with the overall scope of our IRM\npractice requirements and the related burdens, difficulty, and concerns around potential\nproprietary information related with getting such information from other parties.\n\nRisk Mitigation\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to require implementation of practices to\nmitigate risks associated with Predictive DSIs (88 FR 23801). In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we\nproposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A)(2) to require implementation of practices to mitigate risks\nassociated with Predictive DSIs (88 FR 23801). We noted that risk mitigation practices should\nseek to address adverse impacts or minimize anticipated negative impacts of Predictive DSIs on\npatients and populations. We stated model risk mitigation should include disciplined and\nknowledgeable development and implementation practices that are consistent with the real-world\n\n\nFootnote 137:\nSee generally HHS Press Release (April 2023), https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/11/hhs-propose-new-\nrule-to-further-implement-the-21st-century-cures-act.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontext of the model’s use, intended specific application of the model, and goals of the model\nuser.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that some developers may engage in risky\npractices that result in harm or privacy violations and requested more clarity on how certification\ncriteria would exclude developers from engaging in these practices. One commenter encouraged\nONC to clearly define the types of risks or harms that would disqualify a developer from\nProgram certification. One commenter expressed concern that our proposal lacked requirements\nfor DSI systems on managing complaints, post market surveillance, and error or misuse detection\nguidance, as well as reporting requirements related to these issues.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their concerns. We note that developers should\nimplement practices in full awareness that this final rule will not change their responsibility\nunder other applicable laws,<sup>138</sup>\nincluding those that provide legal protections to minimize risk\npractices and prohibit discrimination. We expect that model developers will use data for training\nand testing consistent with applicable law, patients' expectations, and any patient consent or\npreference given. We decline to further specify practices that would disqualify a developer from\n\n\nFootnote 138:\nSee HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 45 CFR part 160 and subparts A and E of part 164; 15 U.S.C.\n\n45(a) (Section 5 of the FTC Act) and Health Breach Notification Rule in 16 CFR part 318; U.S. Dept of Health\n& Human Servs., Office for Civil Rights, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Nondiscrimination in Health Programs\nand Activities, 87 FR 47824, 47880 (Aug. 4, 2022), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/04/2022-\n16217/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color,\nnational origin (including limited English proficiency), sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age,\nor disability in certain health programs or activities through the use of clinical algorithms in their decision-making);\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.

As it relates to managing\ncomplaints and reporting requirements, we note that ONC has long maintained a “health IT\ninquiry and feedback portal,” available where users and the public can file complaints and ask\nquestions about products certified under the Program.<sup>139</sup>\nWe also reiterate that developers of\ncertified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) will be required to\nengage in real world testing per requirements at § 170.405.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported our proposal for risk mitigation requirements.\n\nSeveral commenters recommended that ONC adopt a tiered or risk-based approach to IRM\npractices and adopt requirements that would only apply to applications that present a meaningful\nrisk to patients, allowing ONC to focus on high risk DSIs. These commenters generally\nsupported the assessment of risk in predictive models but stated that requiring all models to\nadhere to the same set of compliance and regulatory rigor seems both unnecessary and overly\nburdensome. Some of these commenters also thought a risk-based approach was appropriate for\ndetermining whether and which disclosure requirements were necessary to prevent stifling\ninnovation and prevent overly restrictive reviews.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments supporting our proposal for risk mitigation. We\ndecline to accept the recommendation to take a risk-based DSI approach as suggested. We\nreiterate that the Program is not predicated on levels of risk and the DSI criterion will continue to\nbe agnostic to specific use cases, intended uses, and risks. As stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\n(88 FR 23799), we will require the developers of certified health IT engage in and document risk\nmanagement practices related to eight characteristics: (1) validity; (2) reliability; (3) robustness;\n\n\nFootnote 139:\nhttps://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) fairness; (5) intelligibility; (6) safety; (7) security; and (8) privacy. However, we have\nprovided substantial flexibility in the risk management practices developers engage in within\nthose characteristics and the associated documentation. Developers may therefore choose to\napply different levels of rigor to the risk analysis, risk mitigation, and governance of different\nPredictive DSIs. Similarly, developers of certified health IT may choose to apply different levels\nof detail describing their approaches to risk management practices as part of the summary\ninformation that must be summited per requirements in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi).\n\nThis approach also aligns with HIPAA Security Rule requirements for covered entities\nand business associates. HIPAA covered entities, such as health care providers and health plans,\nare generally among the customers of developers of certified health IT. In many cases,\ndevelopers of certified health IT serve as HIPAA business associates to their covered entity\ncustomers, such as health care providers or health plans,<sup>140</sup>\nand thus must comply with the\nHIPAA Security Rule. The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business\nassociates to identify and assess risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of electronic PHI (“ePHI”) when conducting the risk analysis and risk management\nrequired by the Security Rule, including any risks of third-party access to a covered entity’s or\nbusiness associate’s information systems that contain electronic protected health information.<sup>141</sup>\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, similar to when a HIPAA covered entity or\nbusiness associate engages with a cloud service provider,<sup>142</sup>\na developer of certified health IT,\n\n\nFootnote 140:\nSee definitions of “business associate” and “covered entity” at 45 CFR 160.103.\n\n\nFootnote 141:\nSee the definition of “electronic protected health information” at 45 CFR 160.103.\n\n\nFootnote 142:\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Guidance on HIPAA & Cloud\nComputing: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/health-information-technology/cloud-\ncomputing/index.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupplying an other party-developed Predictive DSI as part of its Health IT Module,<sup>143</sup>\nshould\nunderstand the ways in which the technology or solution offered by the other party would seek to\nconnect to or integrate with the certified health IT developer’s product(s), so that the covered\nentity or business associate can appropriately conduct its own risk analysis and establish risk\nmanagement policies, as well as enter into appropriate Business Associate<sup>144</sup>\nAgreements\n(BAAs).<sup>145</sup>\nFor example, a health IT developer providing certified health IT as a business\nassociate may consider including in its risk analysis any risks associated with a decision by a\ncovered entity to connect or integrate an other party’s Predictive DSI with the developer’s\ncertified health IT products.<sup>146</sup>\nUnder the HIPAA Security Rule, business associates have an\nindependent obligation to identify and manage risks, regardless of whether or not a BAA\nexists.<sup>147</sup>\nIf a business associate relationship exists and a BAA does not exist, the absence of a\nBAA does not relieve the business associate from HIPAA Security Rule obligations.\n\nAfter consideration of these comments, we have finalized at § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(B) that\nfor each Predictive DSI supplied by the health IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, the\nPredictive DSI must be subject to practices to mitigate risks, identified in accordance with\n\n\nFootnote 143:\nAs noted in HTI-1 Proposed Rule at 88 FR 23796, we note that these “other parties” may or may not have a\ncontractual relationship with the developer of certified health IT.\n\n\nFootnote 144:\nSee definition of “business associate” at 45 CFR 160.103. Business associates include a subcontractor that\ncreates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of the business associate.\n\n\nFootnote 145:\nSee 45 CFR 164.308(b) for information about the Security Rule’s requirements for BAAs. 45 CFR 164.502(e)\npermits a covered entity to disclose PHI to a business associate and to allow a business associate to create, receive,\nmaintain, or transmit PHI on its behalf, if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurance that the business associate\nwill appropriately safeguard the information. Additional guidance on BAAs, often referred to as business associate\ncontracts, is available at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-\nagreement-provisions/index.html.\n\n\nFootnote 146:\nThe risk is based on the connection permitted to the certified health IT product by the health IT developer and not\nwhether the developer has a direct or contractual relationship to the other party.\n\n\nFootnote 147:\nBusiness associates are required to comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. 45 CFR 164.302.\n\nSee OCR’s Direct Liability of Business Associates, https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-\nprofessionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.html; OCR’s Security Rule Guidance material,\navailable at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/index.html?language=es.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A). We note that we have narrowed the scope of Predictive DSIs for which\na developer is expected to mitigate risks to only those Predictive DSIs that are supplied by the\nhealth IT developer as part of its Health IT Module. As stated previously, this is in response to\npublic comments concerned with the overall scope of our proposed IRM practices requirements\nand the related burdens, difficulty, and potential proprietary information concerns related with\ngetting such information from other parties.\n\nGovernance\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(A)(3) to require that\ndevelopers of certified health IT establish policies and implement controls for Predictive DSIs\n(88 FR 23802). We proposed that a developer of a certified Health IT Module that enables or\ninterfaces with a Predictive DSI must establish policies and implement controls for how data are\nacquired, managed, and used for said Predictive DSI.<sup>148</sup>\nGovernance should encompass models,\nsoftware and data developed or provided by other parties as well as internally developed\ninterventions.<sup>149</sup>\nAt 88 FR 23802–23803, we provided a discussion of the flexibility developers of\ncertified health IT would have to choose an approach to meeting this proposed requirement that\naddresses their own unique circumstances for their Predictive DSIs. This included setting and\nenforcing priorities for managing and using data as a strategic asset, which is a concept that\n\n\nFootnote 148:\nSee, e.g., The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Recommendation of the\nCouncil on Health Data Governance, https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0433;\nGeneral Accountability Office (GAO), AI: An Accountability Framework for Federal Agencies and Other Entities\n(June 2021), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-519sp.pdf; See generally GAO, Artificial Intelligence in Health\nCare: Benefits and Challenges of Technologies to Augment Patient Care, (Nov. 2020),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-7sp.\n\n\nFootnote 149:\nSee NIST AI RMF 1.0, https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-1.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentifies key activities of data governance as data identification, data management policy, data\nissues management, data assessment, data oversight, and data communications.<sup>150</sup>\nComments. Several commenters supported our requirement to include “governance” as\npart of the IRM practices. However, many commenters also expressed concern regarding our\nexpectation that developers of certified health IT review governance information from other\nparties or that other parties provide the developer of certified health IT with relevant IRM\ninformation so that such information may be available for both detailed and summary\ndocumentation.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ concerns. In response to public comments, we\nhave not finalized the requirements described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for developers of\ncertified health IT to receive or have access to specific risk management information from other\nparties except when the health IT developer supplies an other party Predictive DSI as part of its\nHealth IT Module. We have finalized as part of Governance requirements in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(C), that for each Predictive DSI supplied by the developer as part of its\nHealth IT Module, the Predictive DSI must be subject to policies and implemented controls for\ngovernance, including how data are acquired, managed, and used. As a result, we clarify that the\nexpectation described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that developers receive or have access to risk\nmanagement information for Predictive DSIs developed by other parties is generally\ninapplicable, unless the developer of health IT is the one supplying the other party’s Predictive\nDSI as part of its Health IT Module.\n\n\nFootnote 150:\nSee for example Federal Data Strategy, Data Governance Playbook,\nhttps://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-governance-playbook.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NIST AI RMF Govern Section 6 discusses a need for policies and procedures to be\nin place to address AI risks and benefits arising from third-party software and data.<sup>151</sup>\nWe note\nthat while not required to follow the NIST AI RMF, developers of certified health IT may wish\nto review Govern Section 6 as this section provides a number of suggested actions and\ndocumentation questions that we believe would be informative towards meeting governance\nrequirements.<sup>152</sup>\nSimilarly, The Office of the Comptroller of Currency similarly described\nseveral best practices related to risk management of models developed by third parties, including\nseventeen specific items included on its internal control questionnaire.<sup>153</sup>\nMany of these practices\ncould apply to the development of governance processes pertaining to risk management of\nmodels authored by other parties including, for example, “When relying on third-party models,\ndoes management obtain ongoing performance monitoring and outcomes analysis of the model\nconducted by third parties”.<sup>154</sup>\nCompile Detailed IRM Practice Documentation\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed that a health IT developer that attests “yes” as\npart of proposed § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) would need to compile detailed documentation\nregarding IRM practices and upon request from ONC make available such detailed\ndocumentation to ONC for any Predictive DSI, as defined in § 170.102, that the certified Health\nIT Module enables or interfaces with (88 FR 23803). We noted our belief that a developer of\n\n\nFootnote 151:\nNIST AI RMF. Govern, Section 6. Available at:\nhttps://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook/Govern.\n\n\nFootnote 152:\nIbid.

One commenter\nrequested clarification on how developers of health IT would meet the proposed documentation\nrequirements when they would need to obtain documentation from third-party developers.\n\n*Response.* As discussed throughout this section, we have finalized a more specific and\nlimited scope for Predictive DSIs that are supplied by the health IT developer as part of its\nHealth IT Module. After consideration of these comments, we have not finalized the proposals\nrequiring developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11)\nto compile detailed documentation regarding the IRM practices listed in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of\nthis section and upon request from ONC, make available such detailed documentation for each\nPredictive DSI.\n\nRequest for Comment\n• Users of Certified Health IT and Predictive DSI Management\nThis request for comment included in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23805–23806)\nfocused on the DSI section, and we sought input on shared responsibilities with users related to\nFAVES DSIs, including intervention or model risk management during implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(deployment) and use, as well as model validation. We welcomed technical and policy comments\non this section. We received many insightful comments on this request for comment.

                      "text": "corresponding proposals for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi)\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed that a health IT developer that attested “yes”\nconsistent with our other proposals would need to submit summary information of the IRM\npractices to its ONC-ACB via publicly accessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly\naccess the information without any preconditions or additional steps (88 FR 23804). We also\nproposed a new Principle of Proper Conduct for the ONC-ACBs to require ONC-ACBs to report\nthe proposed summary information that they received from developers of certified health IT on\nthe Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) for the applicable Health IT Modules. We noted our\nbelief this new Principle of Proper Conduct is consistent with existing public disclosure\nrequirements (e.g., 45 CFR 170.523(f)(1)(xii) and § 170.523(f)(1)(xx)) under the Program and\nwould help ensure accountability for the public availability of information. We proposed to\nrequire that this summary information be made available to ONC-ACBs via publicly accessible\nhyperlink by December 31, 2024.\n\nWe stated that “summary information” should describe risk management practices we\nenumerated in our proposals for the Predictive DSIs with which a certified Health IT Module\nenables or interfaces within general terms. We noted that “summary information,” is not specific\nto any single Predictive DSI. Rather, the information pertains to the suite or portfolio of\nPredictive DSIs enabled by or interfaced with the certified Health IT Module. We noted that the\nsummary information likely encompasses variation in risk management practices for different\nkinds of Predictive DSIs.\n\nSimilar to our policy associated with the API-focused certification criteria in\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(viii)(B), at 88 FR 23805, we proposed that all IRM documentation be available\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia a publicly accessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly access the information\nwithout any preconditions or additional steps. We clarified that for the proposed IRM\ndocumentation, summary information would need to be submitted to the developer of certified\nhealth IT’s ONC-ACB for review prior to issuing a certification. The availability of\ndocumentation as part of the certification process is also consistent with existing requirements\nfor API documentation in § 170.315(g)(10)(viii)(B) (API documentation requirements were\nproposed in the Cures Act Proposed Rule (84 FR 7484) and finalized in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (88 FR 25748)).\n\nTo support submission of documentation, and consistent with other Principles of Proper\nConduct in § 170.523(f)(1), we proposed a new Principle of Proper Conduct for IRM practice\ndocumentation in § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) that ONC-ACBs report the information required in\n§ 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(C) on the CHPL for the applicable certified Health IT Modules. We\nbelieve this new Principle of Proper Conduct will assist in promoting greater transparency for the\nProgram and will strengthen ONC-ACB oversight regarding IRM documentation.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern with the proposed requirement to\nmake summary information about IRM practices available publicly because they believed it\nwould require developers to risk revealing their intellectual property or proprietary information,\nincrease administrative burdens, provide little value to the public, and potentially create\nimbalance in the marketplace. A few commenters suggested that the non-public information that\nthe developer makes available to prospective and existing clients as part of Program certification\nrequirements is sufficient to demonstrate adequate IRM practices. Another commenter\nrecommended flexibility for health care providers that develop health IT solutions specific for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse within their EHR platform so that disclosure of proprietary model information would be\npermissive.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate and understand commenters concerns about revealing\nproprietary information. However, we do not agree that intellectual property or trade secrets are\njeopardized through publication of summary risk management information. Our final policy\ngives developers of certified health IT flexibility to determine what information to describe at\nwhat level of detail they feel is most appropriate. To clarify, the summary information of IRM\npractices requirement do not need to include public disclosure of specific information on code,\nmodel tuning, parameter or hyperparameter selection, or details on how individual input or\noutput variables were selected or operationalized, which we understand to form the\nunderpinnings of developers concerns related to intellectual property. We encourage developers\nto provide information that they determine would be useful to inform potential users of whether a\nmodel is FAVES without providing information at the level of detail that might constitute\nproprietary information.\n\nWe recognize there may be some burden associated with making summary information of\nIRM practices publicly available but we believe the benefits of such transparency outweigh those\nburdens, especially given that we have not required generation of more detailed IRM practice\ninformation as proposed. A primary objective of our policy is to increase trust in the\ndevelopment and use of Predictive DSIs and this includes making summary information on risk\nmanagement practices available to patients, researchers, policymakers, and other interested\nparties.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed support for the proposed requirement to make\nsummary information regarding IRM publicly accessible. One commenter urged ONC to include\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan additional requirement to require a developer to enclose an intelligible end-user fact sheet that\nwould disclose data used for training, potential risks, concerns for bias, performance, and\ngeneralizability, at a minimum, and in clear, concise language.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and suggestions. We note that much of the\ninformation the commenters requested is included within the source attributes listed at §\n170.315(b)(11)(iv). We decline at this time to require developers to disclose source attribute\ninformation publicly, but we have finalized the requirement to publicly disclose summary of\nIRM practices.\n\nAfter consideration of these comments, we have finalized requirements proposed in\n§ 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) requiring that ONC–ACBs shall, where applicable, ensure that summary\ninformation of the IRM practices listed in paragraph § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) is submitted by the\nhealth IT developer via publicly accessible hyperlink that allows any person to access the\nsummary information directly without any preconditions or additional steps.155\n\n\n",

We noted that we viewed the detailed\ndocumentation required as being a by-product of the proposed requirement for the developer of\ncertified health IT to engage or employ in IRM practices. Thus, we expect that developers of\ncertified health IT subject to this proposed requirement would review documentation associated\n\n\nFootnote 155:\nPlease visit the Program’s Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) for information about the Program’s\nauthoritative listing of all certified health IT that have been successfully tested and certified, available at\nhttps://chpl.healthit.gov/#/search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith their IRM practices annually and, as necessary, update their documentation. Further, we\nnoted our belief that developers of certified health IT that attested “yes” would consider risk as\npart of ongoing development cycles, and these risks should be assessed in a timely manner so\nthat risk analysis documentation is up to date. Similar to the HIPAA Security Rule,<sup>156</sup>\nwhich\nrequires covered entities and business associates to conduct ongoing risk analysis,<sup>157</sup>\nwe\nproposed that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules that enable or interface\nwith Predictive DSIs review their IRM practices and update their documentation as necessary.\n\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we considered an annual review as a way to\nestablish a minimum expectation for updating IRM documentation, and believed that would be\ngood for Predictive DSIs to undergo a full validation process at some fixed interval, including\nupdated documentation of all related activities (88 FR 23805). As noted in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule, we considered an annual review as a way to establish a minimum expectation for updating\nIRM documentation, and we believed that would be good practice for Predictive DSIs to undergo\na full validation process at some fixed interval, including updated documentation of all related\nactivities (88 FR 23805). While we did not propose more frequent reviews, we stated those may\nbe appropriate for developers of certified health IT that have Health IT Modules that enable or\ninterface with numerous or complex Predictive DSIs.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive substantive feedback regarding this requirement for\nannual review.\n\n\nFootnote 156:\n45 CFR part 160 and subparts A and C of part 164.\n\n\nFootnote 157:\n45 CFR. 164.306(e) and 164.316(b)(2)(iii); see also OCR Guidance on Risk Analysis,\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/guidance-risk-analysis/index.html (noting that\n“in order for an entity to update and document its security measures ‘as needed,’ which the HIPAA Security Rule\nrequires, it should conduct continuous risk analysis to identity when updates are needed”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* As a result, consistent with all other policy changes we have made for this\nfinal certification criterion, we have finalized requirements in § 170.402(b)(4) that developers\nwith Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11), starting January 1, 2025 and on an\nongoing basis thereafter review and update, as necessary, information in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A)\nand (B), risk management practices described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi), and summary information\nprovided through § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi). As noted previously (see prior comment responses in “v.\n\nPredictive Decision Support Interventions, Attestation for Predictive Decision Support\nInterventions”), we have determined that a supportive Maintenance of Certification requirement\nas part of the Assurances Condition of Certification is necessary to fully implement our policy\nobjectives and proposals. We believe that this finalized policy is substantially similar to what we\nproposed in § 170.315(b)(11)(vii)(D). Moreover, we believe that this finalized policy maintains a\nsubstantially similar, or reduces, scope for developers of certified health IT, depending on\nwhether they supply a Predictive DSI as part of its Health IT Module. For developers of certified\nhealth IT that would have attested “no” to our proposed attestation statement, these developers\ndo not supply a Predictive DSI as part its Health IT Module and, therefore, do not have IRM\npractices or IRM summary information that needs to be reviewed and updated. For developers of\ncertified health IT that would have attested “yes” to our proposed attestation statement, these\nfinalized requirements are a reduction in scope given our focus on Predictive DSIs supplied by a\nhealth IT developer as part of its Health IT Module, as compared to our proposed scope of\nPredictive DSIs enabled or interfaced with a Health IT Module. The requirements proposed are\nthe same as the requirements finalized for these developers of certified health IT that must\nreview and update, as necessary, risk management practices described in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi),\nand summary information provided through § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the finalized requirement in § 170.402(b)(4) to review and update source attribute\ninformation in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A) and (B), we believe this is a clearer articulation of our\nintention proposed at § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and (C). This annual review process clarifies\nexpectations that developers of certified health IT must review and update, as necessary, on an\nongoing basis the source attribute information that was proposed to be available for user review\nin § 170.315(b)(11)(vi)(A) and (C).\n\n\n",

We also proposed\nthat § 170.315(a)(9) would no longer be included as part of the Base EHR definition after\nDecember 31, 2024. Rather, only § 170.315(b)(11) and not § 170.315(a)(9) will be available as a\ncertification criterion to satisfy the definition of Base EHR beginning January 1, 2025.\n\nAdditionally, in § 170.315(a)(9)(vi) we proposed that the adoption of § 170.315(a)(9)\nwould expire on January 1, 2025, for purposes of the Program. Together, these proposals\nidentified the dates when § 170.315(b)(11) replaces § 170.315(a)(9) in the Base EHR definition,\nand they indicated when Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) will need to be certified\nto § 170.315(b)(11) to maintain compliance with the Base EHR definition.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters were not supportive of the proposed requirement to\ndevelopers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) who wish\nfor those Health IT Modules to continue to meet the Base EHR definition would need to certify\nthose Health IT Modules to § 170.315(b)(11) by December 31, 2024, and requested that the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeframe be extended due to the feasibility of implementation. Specifically, commenters\nrequested a compliance timeframe of 24-36 months from final rule to design, program, test,\ncertify, deploy to customers and real word test any new certification requirements for DSI.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their comments regarding our proposal to modify\nthe Base EHR definition in § 170.102 to identify the dates when § 170.315(b)(11) replaces\n§ 170.315(a)(9) in the Base EHR definition.

We have finalized that developers of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) who wish for those Health IT Modules to\ncontinue to meet the Base EHR definition would need to certify those Health IT Modules to\n§ 170.315(b)(11).

                  "text": "At 88 FR 23808–23811, we proposed to revise § 170.405(a) to include § 170.315(a)(9)\nwithin the list of certification criteria for which a developer of certified health IT with Health IT\nModule(s) certified to such criteria must successfully test the real world use of those Health IT\nModule(s) for interoperability in the type of setting in which such Health IT Module(s) would be\nor are marketed. As proposed, this meant that a developer of certified health IT with a Health IT\nModule certified to § 170.315(a)(9) would be subject to the requirements set forth in\n§ 170.405(a) (88 FR 23808). We noted that the effects of including Health IT Modules certified\nto § 170.315(a)(9) in § 170.405(a) and the effect of proposing a revised version of the CDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(11) would require developers of certified health IT certified to\n§ 170.315(a)(9) and § 170.315(b)(11) to follow the testing plans, methods, and results reporting;\nsubmission dates; and August 31 deployment deadline requirements in § 170.405(b) similar to\nthe requirements of other applicable certification criteria listed in § 170.405(a) (88 FR 23809).\n\nWe anticipated that if finalized as proposed this would mean that Health IT Modules certified to\n§ 170.315(a)(9) would be subject to the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements beginning with the 2023 real world testing cycle.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were mixed in their support and opposition to our proposal to\nadd § 170.315(a)(9) to the list of applicable certification criteria for the real world testing\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirement in § 170.405(a) and thus requiring\ndevelopers certified to § 170.315(a)(9) or § 170.315(b)(11) to participate in real world testing\nplan and results submission. Commenters that did not support including § 170.315(a)(9) in the\nlist of applicable criteria for real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements stating that it would be infeasible, and a poor investment of time and resources\ngiven the possible timing of this final rule publication in conjunction with requirements for 2024\nreal world testing plan submissions in November of 2023. Commenters stated that it would\ncreate significant developer burden to meet this requirement for a criterion that developers could\nnot certify to after December 31, 2024. Many of these commenters instead said we should limit\nreal world testing requirement to developers of certified health IT with Health IT Module(s)\ncertified to § 170.315(b)(11). Commenters suggested that by only including § 170.315(b)(11)\nthen ONC and developers could focus resources on a revised criterion instead of a retired\ncriterion. Commenters also recommended a phased approach for the inclusion of Predictive DSI\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninto real world testing given the burden on developers to implement other proposals in the rule,\nnotably the new Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\nCommenters who were supportive of the proposal to add § 170.315(a)(9), thus requiring\ndevelopers certified to § 170.315(b)(11) to participate in real world testing, stated that it would\nhave the benefit of testing predictive models in a diverse range of real world clinical settings,\nthereby creating a more accurate, comprehensive, and contextual understanding of a model's\nperformance. Commenters noted that including CDS will help ensure implementation of the\nCDS Criterion, future certification criteria, and other elements discussed in this rule are effective,\nefficient, minimally burdensome, and beneficial, and would ensure intended performance in\npractice. One commenter stated that adding CDS to real world testing will give developers an\nopportunity to determine if the user community is using their interventions, and if so, the ability\nto determine how the interventions are being used. Lastly, one commenter believed that testing\ndecision support intervention technology and predictive models successfully for real world use\nenhances interoperability and patient care experience in which certified Health IT Modules\nwould be marketed.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate comments regarding our proposal to revise § 170.405(a) to\ninclude § 170.315(a)(9). Given the mixed support from commenters and finalization of our\npolicy to replace § 170.315(a)(9) with § 170.315(b)(11) as of January 1, 2025, we have not\nfinalized our proposal to modify § 170.405(a) to include Health IT Modules certified to\n§ 170.315(a)(9). We agree with commenters that requiring developers of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) to engage in real world testing for only the period\nof time before the revised criterion expires is unnecessary. We continue to believe there is value\nfor developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9) to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemonstrate how their support of evidence-based CDS and linked referential CDS positively\nimpacts patient care through real world testing plans and results; however, we think it would be\nmore important for developers of certified health IT to spend time and resources conforming to\nrequirements in § 170.315(b)(11) and § 170.402(b)(4) by January 1, 2025.\n\nWe note that because all criteria in § 170.315(b) are already subject to real world testing\nrequirements in § 170.405, Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) prior to August 31,\n2024, would need to, among other requirements, address each of the elements in\n§ 170.405(b)(1)(iii)(A) through (G) in their real world testing plans by December 15, 2024, and\nsubmit results based on those plans no later than March 15, 2026.\n\nWe appreciate those commenters who supported our proposals for real world testing\nbecause it would have various benefits for more accurate, comprehensive, and contextual\nunderstanding of a model's performance. We also appreciate the commenters that stated how\nreal-world testing will give developers an opportunity to determine if the user community is\nusing their interventions, and if so, the ability to determine how the interventions are being used.\n\nWe agree and we encourage developers of certified health IT to consider ways to demonstrate\nvalidity or fairness of Predictive DSIs in local data as a means to fulfill the requirements for real\nworld testing plans and results.\n\n*Comments.* A minority of commenters did not support including either § 170.315(a)(9) or\n§ 170.315(b)(11) in real world testing and stated neither certification criterion appropriately fit\nthe stated intent for the scope of Real world Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification.\n\nOne commenter recommended including § 170.315(a)(9) in real world testing, with the proposed\nupdates, but only if ONC would keep § 170.315(a)(9) as a certification criterion and add\n§ 170.315(b)(11) as a separate certification criterion, noting that requiring real world testing for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive DSI immediately after development and implementation is overly burdensome for\ndevelopers.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and we have not finalized our proposal to\nmodify § 170.405(a) to include Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(9). We note that\ncertification criteria at § 170.315(b) are already subject to real world testing requirements\nidentified in § 170.405; thus, Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) will be subject to\nthe same requirements currently applied to Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(1), for\nexample. We believe real world testing would not be overly burdensome with the\nimplementation of the DSI requirements under § 170.315(b)(11).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters questioned the logistics of real world testing CDS and\nDSI criteria and sought clarity on how the proposed real world testing plan will be assessed.\n\nSpecifically, one commenter sought clarity on how real world testing would impact a health\nplan’s existing operations. One commenter suggested that certification testing could be\naccomplished using a test data set that incorporates synthetic patient records containing a wide\nrange of demographic and health condition information, including rare diseases and conditions,\nnoting that DSI training and testing data should be developed in collaboration with provider,\npatient, research, and health IT partners and made available to all parties in a standardized,\ncomputable format. In the interest of program flexibility, one commenter suggested that real\nworld testing of CDS should allow for some types of survey or questionnaire form for providers\nto offer feedback on the value and use of CDS in the EHR rather than trying to capture analytics\nor metrics on CDS use from the EHR as developers are required to do with other real world\ntesting criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We note that we did not propose any changes to the requirements of real world\ntesting plans and results submission, which are currently described in § 170.405(b)(1)-(2). We\nalso invite readers to review discussion in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25766 and\nvisit the numerous resources we have developed to support ongoing implementation of the real\nworld testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements at\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/real-world-testing.\n\n\n",

Several commenters welcomed the flexibility offered by this approach to use\nupdated versions of NTP or specified versions of NTP, such as Microsoft's MS-SNTP. One\ncommenter noted support for our proposal but urged consistency across organizational networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand systems to ensure that the same network time protocol is used across all servers and\nplatforms.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ support for this proposal. We have finalized\nthe changes as proposed, including the removal of a named standard in § 170.210(g), but we will\nrequire Health IT Modules to utilize a system clock that has been synchronized using any NTP\nstandard.\n\n*Comments.* A health IT expert organization requested ONC comment on the NTP test\nprocedure by either explicitly removing the demonstration requirement or describing a test\nprocedure to demonstrate time server accuracy to accommodate a variation in time services\nused.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for the comment. While the request is outside the\nscope of this final rule because conformance methods, including testing procedures, are not\ndetermined as part of notice and comment rulemaking, we will consider updating the test\nprocedures in the future.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In an interim final rule (IFR) published on November 4, 2020 (85 FR 70064), we\naddressed an ambiguity regarding how our refresh token requirements, in\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A), would apply to “native applications.”<sup>158</sup>\nIn response to public feedback\nin the IFR and subsequent interaction with interested parties, a history of which can be found in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23812), we proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to remove\nmention of “applications capable of storing a client secret” from § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii)\nand § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2)(ii), as well as to revise § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) to state, “A\nHealth IT Module’s authorization server must issue a refresh token valid for a period of no less\nthan three months to applications using the ‘confidential app’ profile according to an\n\n\nFootnote 158:\nAccording to IETF RFC 6749, “native applications are “clients installed and executed on the device used by the\nresource owner (i.e., desktop application, native mobile application).” See IETF RFC 6749: https://tools.ietf.org/\nhtml/ rfc6749.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimplementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c)” (88 FR 23813). We also proposed to\nrevise § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2)(ii) to state, “A Health IT Module's authorization server must\nissue a refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months to applications using the\n‘confidential app’ profile according to an implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(c)”\n\n(88 FR 23813). We stated that these proposed revisions would better reflect a Health IT\nModule’s obligation for first time and subsequent connection refresh tokens using concepts\nfamiliar to industry and according to the HL7 FHIR SMART Application Launch Framework\nImplementation Guide (IG). We noted that existing requirements for Health IT Modules to issue\na refresh token to native applications, consistent with § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(iii), remained\nunchanged.\n\nWe also stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that we would continue to monitor\nimplementation of § 170.315(g)(10), engage with the standards development community, and\nprovide information through existing ONC Certification Companion Guides (CCGs), the ONC\nAPI Resource Guide, and other educational materials.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters expressed support for our proposal to revise\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) to reference the “confidential app” profile defined in the\nHL7 FHIR SMART Application Launch Framework IG as part of our refresh token support\nrequirements. Several of these commenters expressed appreciation for our reference to an\nindustry standard and noted the important role of this standard for driving consistent\nimplementations and interoperability.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We have finalized our revisions\nto § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) as proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters raised concerns around the impacts to app developers of\nbreaking API changes, particularly changes that affect refresh token validity. These commenters\nsuggested requirements that app developers be given advance notification of upcoming breaking\nchanges that affect refresh tokens.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these commenters’ concerns and suggestions. We remind\ncommenters of the scope of our revisions to § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) in this final\nrule, and specifically note that our revisions do not change certain previously finalized\nrequirements around refresh tokens, namely that Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10)\nmust issue refresh tokens valid for a period of no less than three months.<sup>159</sup>\nWe also remind\ncommenters of our existing API Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements at 45\nCFR 170.404, which apply to developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified\nto § 170.315(g)(10). Specifically, at § 170.404(a)(4)(iii), we have “service and support\nobligations” that Certified API Developers must abide by. These obligations include\nrequirements for Certified API Developers to “make reasonable efforts to maintain the\ncompatibility of its certified API technology and to otherwise avoid disrupting the use of\ncertified API technology in production environments” by API Users. While we appreciate the\nspecific suggestions from commenters for added requirements, we decline to add these\nrequirements in this final rule. In the circumstance where a Certified API Developer must make a\nchange to their technology that affects refresh token validity, we expect that the Certified API\nDeveloper abide by the obligations referenced above to enable the continued and effective\nproduction use of their certified API technology.\n\n\nFootnote 159:\nSee § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii), (iii), and (2)(ii) in 85 FR 70083.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested that refresh tokens for non-patient facing\napplications should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for security reasons. One commenter\nasked that we clarify that apps may, at times, be required to request a new token with new access\nscopes instead of using a refresh token and that this is not a violation of our refresh token\npolicies. Another commenter suggested that we change the requirements for the duration of\nrefresh tokens and that three months is not always appropriate in all cases.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these suggestions from commenters. We do not agree that we\nshould include separate requirements for refresh tokens that apply only in non-patient facing\napplication use cases at this time. We remind this commenter of what we stated in the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25746 – 25747 when responding to commenters who similarly\nraised security concerns and suggested we finalize different requirements for refresh tokens\nbased on patient versus non-patient facing application use cases. Those sections of the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule also clarify what implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModules are allowed to do regarding refresh token length and clarify what practices we see as\nrestricted. We stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that “[r]efresh tokens are commonly used\nin healthcare and other industries” and that “implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health\nIT Modules are not prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens for users of the API\nincluding patients and providers to align with their institutional policies.” We also stated that\n“implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of\ninformation blocking provisions applicable to them and that requiring patients to re-authenticate\nand re-authorize at a high frequency could inhibit patient access and implicate information\nblocking” (85 FR 25747).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding duration of refresh tokens, we again remind commenters of what we clarified\nin the ONC Cures Act Final Rule where we noted that “we believe a refresh token valid for a\nperiod of three months is sufficient to balance persistent access and security concerns” (85 FR\n25747). We also stated that implementers (e.g., hospitals) “of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health\nIT Modules are not prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens for users of the API,\nincluding patients and providers, to align with their institutional policies. Further, implementers\nof § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules are not prohibited from implementing their\n§ 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules in accordance with their organizational security\npolicies and posture, including by instituting policies for re-authentication and re-authorization\n(e.g., providers and/or patients could always be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize after\na set number of refresh tokens have been issued)” (85 FR 25747). Further, we clarify that\n§ 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules may require a new authorization request from an\napplication to provision that application with scopes not already granted.\n\nIn acknowledgement of the comments received, we have finalized our requirements in\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) to reference the “confidential app” profile defined in the\nHL7 FHIR SMART Application Launch Framework as proposed.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, 88 FR 23813 to 238144, we included a proposal to adopt the\nFHIR US Core IG v5.0.1 in § 170.215(b)(1)(ii) and incorporate it by reference in § 170.299. We\nnoted that based on the annual US Core release cycle, the FHIR US Core IG v6.0.0 would likely\nbe published between the release of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and our finalization of this final\nrule. Assuming the FHIR US Core IG v6.0.0 was published prior to the release of this final rule,\nwe stated that we would consider adopting v6.0.0 rather than v5.0.1. We stated our belief that the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFHIR US Core IG v6.0.0 would support the data elements and data classes in USCDI v3, which\nwe also proposed to adopt in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\nIn addition, we proposed to update some of the cross-references to the FHIR US Core IG\nv3.1.1 in § 170.215(a)(2) in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) and (B), (ii)(A) and (iv)(A) to instead refer to\nFHIR US Core IG v5.0.1. Finally, we proposed to restructure the standards in § 170.215 to better\ncategorize API standards and to enable simultaneous use of different versions of IGs for a set\nperiod. For example, we proposed categorizing the US Core IG v3.1.1 in § 170.215(b)(1)(i) as\npart of a group of standards for constraining and profiling data elements, and we proposed that\nthe adoption of this standard would expire on January 1, 2025. We proposed to include the US\nCore IG v5.0.1 in this same group in § 170.215(b)(1)(ii).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters overwhelmingly supported our proposal to advance the version\nof the FHIR US Core IG included in § 170.215 and incorporated by reference in § 170.299. Most\nof the commenters specifically voiced support for including the FHIR US Core IG v6.0.0, which\nwas published in May 2023 and supports the data elements and data classes in USCDI v3. We\ndid not receive any comments in favor of adopting the FHIR US Core IG v5.0.1 rather than\nv6.0.0. Commenters noted that the FHIR US Core IG v6.0.0 aligns with our proposals elsewhere\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, including our proposals to adopt USCDI v3 and the SMART v2\nIG.\n\nWe received only one comment in opposition to the proposal to advance the version of\nthe FHIR US Core IG, which expressed concerns about the limited amount of time for\ndevelopers to test and implement v5.0.1. While still supportive of advancing the version of the\nFHIR US Core IG, several other commenters also expressed concerns about the timelines for\nadoption of the latest version. These commenters urged ONC to acknowledge the development\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime and effort required to support a newer version of the US Core FHIR IG and consider\nextending the deadline for certification to a newer version.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support. The HL7 standards development\ncommunity published FHIR US Core 6.0.0 in May 2023. As anticipated, FHIR US Core 6.0.0\nadded new and updated FHIR profiles to represent new data elements and classes included in\nUSCDI v3. We considered adopting FHIR US Core 5.0.1 and FHIR US Core 6.0.0 and using the\nStandards Version Advancement Process (SVAP) to enable developers of certified health IT to\nuse FHIR US Core 6.1.0 to certify Health IT Modules that require support of the USCDI.\n\nHowever, we concluded that this would be insufficient to achieve our policy objectives for\nimproved interoperability and lead to misalignment in the marketplace. This is because use of the\nSVAP by developers of certified health IT is voluntary and experience to-date indicates that a\nminority of developers of certified health IT choose to avail their Health IT Modules to use\nnewer standards. Adopting FHIR US Core 6.1.0 establishes a consistent baseline across all\nHealth IT Modules certified to criteria that reference the USCDI and provides clarity to\ndevelopers of certified health IT regarding which version of the US Core IG they are expected to\nuse in support of USCDI v3 and which version they can expect to encounter when interacting\nwith other actors in the health IT ecosystem, industry-wide.\n\nAfter the publishing of FHIR US Core 6.0.0, HL7 found errors with how the guide\nimplemented data elements in USCDI v3 and had to make updates to the specification to align\nwith USCDI v3 and ensure that USCDI v3 can be implemented in Health IT Modules. Adopting\nFHIR US Core 6.1.0 is necessary for developers of certified health IT to have appropriate\nimplementation guidance to meet the criteria adopted in this final rule that reference USCDI v3.\n\nBased on public comments on this and prior rulemakings, we believe that the health IT industry,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealthcare standards developers, and health care providers expect and support ONC making such\ndeterminations so that the adopted version of standards are the most up-to-date available and are\nfeasible for real world implementation (see, for example, 85 FR 25677 and 25708).\n\nWe have finalized the adoption of the FHIR US Core 6.1.0 in § 170.215 and incorporated\nit by reference in § 170.299. We have also finalized our proposal to restructure the standards in\n§ 170.215 and adopted the FHIR US Core 6.1.0 at § 170.215(b)(1)(ii). Likewise, we have\nfinalized our proposal to categorize the FHIR US Core IG v3.1.1 in § 170.215(b)(1)(i) as part of\na group of standards for constraining and profiling data elements and have finalized our proposal\nthat the adoption of this standard would expire on January 1, 2026. With regard to concerns\nabout compliance dates, we refer readers to the discussion in section II.C (General Comments on\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule) of this final rule.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized API Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements in 45 CFR 170.404(b)(2) which contain a specific provision requiring Certified\nAPI Developers, for Health IT Modules certified to the certification criterion in §\n170.315(g)(10), to publicly publish certain “service base URLs”— otherwise known as\n“endpoints” — for all their customers and in a machine-readable format at no charge (85 FR\n25764 – 25765). These electronic endpoints are the specific locations on the internet that make it\npossible for apps to access EHI at the patient’s request.\n\nAs we developed these service base URL publication requirements in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule, we acknowledged the importance of industry alignment and standardization in this\narea by indicating that we “strongly encourage API Technology Suppliers, health care providers,\nHINs and patient advocacy organizations to coalesce around the development of a public\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresource or service from which all interested parties could benefit” (84 FR 7494). We ultimately\ndid not adopt specific standards for the publication format of these service base URLs in the\nONC Cures Act Final Rule to provide industry an opportunity to coalesce on specifications. We\nfinalized § 170.404(b)(2) to require that Certified API Developers must make their service base\nURLs freely accessible and in a machine-readable format at no charge (85 FR 25765).\n\nHowever, since the ONC Cures Act Final Rule was published, we have found that\ndevelopers with publicly discoverable endpoint lists have defined their own bespoke publication\napproaches and unique formats. This variability across developers of certified health IT in the\nformat they are using to publish their service base URLs indicates the industry has not coalesced\naround a common framework or approach. Research conducted through ONC’s Lantern Project\nconfirms this variability among developers of certified health IT, which is hindering maturation\nof a vibrant app ecosystem for patients and the healthcare community,<sup>160</sup>\na primary objective\nwithin the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan.<sup>161</sup>\nThe inconsistent implementation of our service base URL requirement has also rendered\nimportant data meant to facilitate connections to endpoints difficult to access.<sup>162</sup>\nSpecifically, the\norganization details of the API Information Source associated with a service base URL is not\nalways available, and even when available, is not always available in a format that can be readily\nused. Patient-facing apps require access to these service base URLs to provide patients access to\ninformation maintained by specific provider organizations that deploy certified API technology\n\n\nFootnote 160:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/healthit-certification/shining-a-light-on-fhir-implementation-progress-\ntoward-publishing-fhir-endpoints\n\n\nFootnote 161:\nSee objective 1b in the 2020-2025 Federal Health IT Strategic Plan at https://www.healthit.gov/topic/2020-2025-\nfederal-health-it-strategic-plan\n\n\nFootnote 162:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/news/events/onc-lantern-workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i.e., API Information Sources). Without standardized formats and an ability to search for service\nbase URLs, patients are hindered in their ability to find which service base URL(s) refer to their\nprovider. Similar barriers exist for others involved in healthcare seeking to leverage apps for\ninteroperability.\n\nAdditionally, it is difficult to map multiple, unique organizations to service base URLs.\n\nExperience to-date indicates that the name of the organization associated with a service base\nURL is typically formatted as free text (i.e., String). A single String is unable to represent the\ncomplexity of healthcare systems, where a system can contain many subsystems, or where a\nFHIR API URL can support a set of systems. Including all organizations that are serviced by a\nservice base URL is important for discovery of which service base URL serves a particular\nhealth care provider, which in turn would allow API users to access relevant EHI through that\nservice base URL. Having all healthcare organizations serviced by the service base URL\naccessible and in a standardized format would help app developers easily fetch information to\nenable patients and other users to access, exchange, and use information.\n\nTo address the inconsistencies in service base URL publication and challenges with\nmapping, we proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to revise the requirement in § 170.404(b)(2)\nto include new data format requirements (88 FR 23814). We anticipated that these new\nspecifications would establish standards for industry adoption and better facilitate patient access\nto their health information. In the revised § 170.404(b)(2), we also proposed to incorporate the\nfollowing existing requirements in § 170.404(b)(2)(i) and (ii): a Certified API Developer must\npublish service base URLs “[f]or all of its customers regardless of whether the Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are centrally managed by the Certified API Developer or\nlocally deployed by an API Information Source;” and publish these service base URLs “at no\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncharge” as part of proposed § 170.404(b)(2). We proposed that Certified API Developers publish\nthese standardized details by December 31, 2024.\n\nIn § 170.404(b)(2)(i), we proposed to require that service base URLs must be published\nin “Endpoint” resource format according to the FHIR standard adopted in § 170.215(a) (88 FR\n23814). Additionally, in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) and subparagraphs § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A) and §\n170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B), we proposed to require that organization details such as name, location, and\nprovider identifiers (e.g., National Provider Identifier (NPI), CMS Certification Number (CCN),\nor health system ID) for each service base URL must be published in US Core “Organization”\nresource format according to the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(b)(1) (we\nnote that elsewhere in this final rule, in section III.C.7.b, we discuss the proposal to move US\nCore IGs to § 170.215(b)(1)), with the “Organization.endpoint” element referencing the service\nbase URLs managed by this organization.\n\nWe proposed the Endpoint and Organization resource formats because they are based on\nthe FHIR Release 4 and US Core IG industry standards that are already adopted for use in the\nProgram in § 170.315(g)(10). We specifically proposed the FHIR “Endpoint” resource because it\nis used for representing technical endpoint details and contains a required “address” element that,\naccording to the FHIR R4 standard, contains “the technical base address for connecting to this\nendpoint.”<sup>163</sup>\nWe noted that Certified API Developers would be able to populate this element, in\neach of their published “Endpoint” resources, with a service base URL that can be used by\npatients to access their EHI.\n\n\nFootnote 163:\nhttps://hl7.org/fhir/R4/endpoint.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe additionally proposed the US Core “Organization” resource because it can be used to\nrepresent important contextual information around a service base URL (88 FR 23814 through\n23815). We noted that the US Core “Organization” resource contains an optional “endpoint”\nelement that can be used to reference “technical endpoints providing access to services operated\nfor the organization.”<sup>164</sup>\nTo standardize a link between published “Endpoint” resources and\norganization details relating to the organization that services these endpoints, we proposed to\nrequire, in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A), that this optional “endpoint” element be populated on publicly\npublished “Organization” resources and that they reference the “Endpoints” managed by the\norganization. We noted that “publicly published” meant that the information is made publicly\navailable and noted that ONC will host a link to developers’ service base URL list on the\nCertified Health IT Product List (CHPL) or another website hosted by ONC. We stated that this\ninformation would give the public a standard way of knowing how published “Endpoint” and\npublished “Organization” resources are linked and which organization details apply to which\nservice base URLs.\n\nAdditionally, we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that the US Core “Organization”\nresource contains a “mandatory” element called “name” that contains a “name used for the\norganization” (88 FR 23815). In addition to this required element, we proposed in §\n170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B) to require Certified API Developers to make available “must support”\nelements of organization location and provider identifier(s) using the US Core “Organization”\nresource. An organization’s location could be an address that is populated in the “address”\nelement of the US Core “Organization” resource; and a provider identifier could be a National\n\n\nFootnote 164:\nhttps://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, or\nother health system ID populated in the “identifier” element. We noted that this information\nhelps contextualize service base URLs and enables application developers to more easily and\nconsistently provide patient access to their electronic health information.\n\nFinally, we proposed, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii), requirements for collection and\nmaintenance of Endpoint and organization resources. Specifically, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(A), we\nproposed to require that these resources be collected in a “Bundle” resource, according to the\nFHIR standard adopted in § 170.215(a), that the Certified API Developer would publicly publish\n(88 FR 23815). According to the FHIR specification, a “Bundle” acts as “a container for a\ncollection of resources” and is widely used in use cases, such as returning search results and\ngrouping resources as part of a message exchange.<sup>165</sup>\nGiven the broad use of the “Bundle”\nresource throughout the FHIR specification (e.g., FHIR search), we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule our expectation that most FHIR clients and FHIR application developers would be familiar\nwith the “Bundle” resource and be able to parse “Bundle” resources electronically and extract\nrelevant information from them for use in their application. Alternatively, we considered a\ndifferent format for requiring that the Endpoint and Organization resources be collected for\npublication. We also considered the Newline Delimited JSON (ndjson) format (88 FR 23815).\n\nAccording to the ndjson specification, this format is convenient for publishing “structured data\nthat may be processed one record at a time.”<sup>166</sup>\nThe ndjson format is an efficient way for\nmachines to parse large amounts of data given that the entire file does not need to be read into\nmemory before parsing. As we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we expect that these\n\n\nFootnote 165:\nhttp://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html\n\n\nFootnote 166:\nhttp://ndjson.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Endpoint” and “Organization” JSON resource lists may be large, depending on the developer of\ncertified health IT’s client base. We noted our expectation that most Certified API Developers\nwould be familiar with this format because it is included as an underlying standard in the FHIR\nBulk Data Access IG required for certification to § 170.315(g)(10). Given the simplicity of the\nndjson standard, we also noted our expectation that most FHIR clients and FHIR application\ndevelopers would easily be able to parse ndjson files electronically and extract relevant\ninformation from them for use in their application.\n\nWe also proposed, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B), that Certified API Developers review\nEndpoint and Organization resources quarterly and, as necessary, update the information (88 FR\n23815). We recognized that as customers upgrade and install new health IT, data provided in the\nEndpoint and Organization resources will change. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we noted that a\none-time publication of the developer’s current list of endpoints for active customers upon\ncertification to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion will only meet initial certification requirements,\nand we proposed to establish in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B) a requirement that Certified API\nDevelopers maintain this information over time. We also noted that failure to maintain the\nservice base URLs and ensure the associated organization information remains up to date and\nfree of errors or defects on a quarterly basis would be considered a violation of this Condition\nand Maintenance of Certification requirement and may result in corrective action. We clarified\nthat any endpoint or organization information that is out of date, incomplete, or otherwise\nunusable for more than 90-days would be considered in violation of this proposed requirement.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters support the continued development and\nstandardization of publication formats for FHIR “service base URLs” otherwise known as\n“endpoints,” noting that standardization would better facilitate interoperability and address\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchallenges that exist in operationalizing connections to FHIR servers for facilitating patient\naccess. Many of these supportive commenters cautioned that our proposal does not align with the\ndirection of industry and one commenter raised a particular concern that our proposal is not\nbased in implementation experience and has not been informed by a draft implementation guide.\n\nAnother commenter noted that since we are proposing that the “endpoint” element in the US\nCore “Organization” resource be used to reference FHIR R4 “Endpoint” resource(s), we should\nmake specific and clear reference to the applicability of FHIR R4 and its detailed standards on\nEndpoint. Most of these commenters also offered suggestions on how we should change our\nproposal by citing the Argonaut implementation guide for Patient-access Brands as standard and\nthe industry driven approach we should consider referencing for this endpoint publication use\ncase.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support of the continued development in\nthis space and suggestions for improvement. The “Patient-access Brands” conceptual model,\ndeveloped by the FHIR community through the Argonaut Project, has advanced significantly\nsince publication of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. A connectathon, which is an event where the\nFHIR community gathers and tests emerging FHIR standards, was held in May 2023 and it\nincluded developers of certified health IT and app developers who tested the real-world\nfeasibility of the Patient-access Brands model.<sup>167</sup>\nAdditionally, at the September 2023 HL7\nWorking Group Meeting, the FHIR community discussed and finalized new changes to the\nPatient-access Brands model.<sup>168</sup>\nCurrently, the Patient-access Brands model is incorporated into\n\n\nFootnote 167:\nMore information on this connectathon can be found at\nhttps://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90350859#EndpointCallNotes-2023-5-312-\n5pET:Connectathon\n\n\nFootnote 168:\nSee https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-42134\n\n\n\n\n\n\na section of the continuous build draft version of the SMART App Launch IG.<sup>169</sup>\nThis indicates\nthat the Patient-access Brands model is now a draft specification and is on track for publication\nin a future version of the SMART App Launch IG.\n\nWe agree with commenters that the Patient-access Brands specification is a key\nstandardized approach for the endpoint publication use case and we are committed to aligning\nour requirements with industry efforts. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, our proposal generally\naligned with the current draft Patient-access Brands specification by calling for the use of\n“Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources for representing endpoints (e.g., service base\nURLs) and corresponding organization (e.g., API Information Source) details in a standardized\nformat.\n\nAdditionally, in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, our proposal, similarly to the current draft of\nPatient-access Brands specification, called for the use of the “endpoint” element in the US Core\n“Organization” resource for linking “Endpoint” resources and organizational details relating to\nthe organization that services this endpoint.<sup>170</sup>\nHowever, our proposal in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule is not an exact match of the underlying construct defined in the Patient-access Brands\nspecification. One key difference that could result in incompatibilities between our requirements\nand the industry led efforts in the Patient-access Brands specification is that we referenced the\nUS Core profile of the base FHIR “Organization” resource, while the Patient-access Brands\nspecification includes its own custom profile of the base FHIR “Organization” resource. Both\n\n\nFootnote 169:\nhttps://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/branches/pab/brands.html\n\n\nFootnote 170:\nDuring the public comment period for the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, the draft Patient-access Brands specification\ncalled for the use of the “managiningOrganization” element in the “Endpoint” resource for linking “Endpoint” and\n“Organization” resources. At the September 2023 HL7 Working Group Meeting, occurring after the comment\nperiod for the HTI-1 Proposed Rule closed, the FHIR community approved a change to use the “endpoint” element\nin the “Organization” resource instead of the “managiningOrganization” element in the “Endpoint” resource for\nlinking “Endpoint” and “Organization” resources. See https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-42134.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprofiles are based off the base FHIR “Organization” resource, but they each contain their own\nsets of constraints to best match their use cases.\n\nBased on commenter feedback, we do not believe it is necessary for us to impose US\nCore level “Organization” resource constraints and reference the FHIR “Organization” resource\nvia the US Core IG at this time. We agree with the commenter who recommended a specific and\nclear reference to the applicability of FHIR R4. We realize that we introduced some unnecessary\nconfusion by referencing two separate but related standards, namely FHIR R4 and US Core, in\nseparate paragraphs of our proposed criterion updates in § 170.404(b)(2). To simplify our\nrequirements and make a more specific and clear reference to FHIR R4, we believe it is\nnecessary to reference one standard, namely FHIR R4. We also agree with the many commenters\nwho emphasized the importance of considering and not conflicting with the standards developed\nby the FHIR community for the endpoint publication use case, and we believe that referencing\nthe more general FHIR R4 standard for our Program reduces the risk of conflicting requirements.\n\nTo generalize our proposal, respond to commenter feedback, and to align our\nrequirements with emerging industry standards for the endpoint discovery use case, we have\nfinalized a modified version of our proposed requirements at § 170.404(b)(2). We have modified\nthe standard referenced in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to require the use of the base FHIR “Organization”\nresource instead of the more constrained US Core-profiled version of the base FHIR\n“Organization” resource. Specifically, we have revised § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to reference the\nstandard adopted in § 170.215(a). We emphasize that subparagraphs of finalized §\n170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) remain largely unchanged, meaning that Certified API Developers\nwill still be required to reference “Endpoint” resources using the “endpoint” element in the\n“Organization” FHIR resource and will still be required to publish organization details such as\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname, location, and facility identifier. With this modification, we have finalized a policy that is\nless prescriptive than what we proposed. By referencing the base FHIR “Organization” resource,\ninstead of the US Core-profiled “Organization” resource, Certified API Developers have more\nflexibility to support the “Organization” resource without minimal element constraints and no\nelements are marked as “must support.” We note that when proposing the US Core\n“Organization” resource profile, we referenced certain mandatory and “must support” elements\ncontained in that profile, including “address,” “name,” and “identifier.” We did not adopt these\nconstraints; rather, we are leaving it up to the Certified API Developer to determine how best to\npublish the required organization details using the base FHIR standard instead of the more\nconstrained US Core IG. Overall, this change will provide industry with more flexibility to meet\nProgram requirements as standards evolve. We have finalized our proposal in § 170.404(b)(2) to\nrequire Certified API Developers to publish these standardized details by December 31, 2024, as\nproposed. We clarify that for the time period between when this final rule is effective and\nDecember 31, 2024, that Certified API Developers may fulfill their obligations at §\n170.404(b)(2) by publicly publishing the service base URLs for all customers in a machine-\nreadable format at no charge.\n\nThis modification supports our goal of addressing the inconsistent implementation of our\nservice base URL requirement and better facilitates patient access to their health information by\nrequiring the use of a consistent data format, while also reflecting feedback received from\nsoftware developers, technology companies, and standards developer interested parties. This\nmodification also better aligns our requirements with the underlying data format constructs\ncurrently defined in the leading, and still emerging, industry specification in this area, namely the\nPatient-access Brands specification. We hope to give Certified API Developers the option of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nusing the data format structure in Patient-access Brands specification to publish their service\nbase URLs and organization data we require without being in conflict with our data format\nrequirements for the Program. We note that at the time of publication of this final rule, the\nPatient-access Brands specification is still in draft form and may evolve over time, including the\naddition of breaking changes. We will consider the Patient-access Brands specification for\nadoption in future rulemaking as it develops.\n\n*Comments.* In addition to the Patient-access Brands specification, several commenters\nnoted the Directory IG for TEFCA as a standard to consider for the endpoint publication use\ncase. All but one of these commenters cited the Directory IG for TEFCA alongside the Patient-\naccess Brands specification and advocated for the alignment of TEFCA with the Patient-access\nBrands specification. One commenter advocated specifically for changes to our proposal based\non the Directory IG for TEFCA, stating that we should consider it for defining the format of\nFHIR “Organization” and “Endpoint” resources for the endpoint publication use case.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the notes from commenters pointing us to other work in the\nendpoint publication space to consider. The Directory IG for TEFCA is under active\ndevelopment and is being designed to support the TEFCA use case and the participants within\nthat framework. <sup>171</sup>\nWe agree that this IG is an important standard to keep in mind for supporting\nthe endpoint publication use case more broadly but, because it already includes constraints and\nextensions that go beyond the relatively small set of elements we proposed requiring of\ndevelopers, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested using it for specifying the\nformat of FHIR “Organization” and “Endpoint” resources used for publishing endpoints in our\n\n\nFootnote 171:\nhttps://rce.sequoiaproject.org/RCEIG/output/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram at this time. However, we note that because we have finalized an approach in §\n170.404(b)(2) that references the base FHIR standard, Certified API Developers have the\nflexibility to consider using “Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources profiles, such as the\nprofiles in the Directory IG for TEFCA, to meet our requirements.\n\nRegarding the suggestions to align TEFCA with the Patient-access Brands specification,\nwe thank commenters for this suggestion but note that it is outside the scope of the proposals\nrelated to TEFCA in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. We will continue to monitor the development of\nthese standards and may take them into consideration in future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters asked that we clarify the intended use of the\norganization details we proposed to be published. More specifically, commenters asked that we\nclarify that we expect organization or facility level identifiers, rather than individual practitioner\nidentifiers, to be published. Many of these commenters noted that the publication of individual\npractitioner identifiers is out of scope for our intended use case. Additionally, one commenter\nnoted the active work on a National Directory FHIR IG and said that it would be an approach to\nconsider if we intend for practitioner level identifiers to be published.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ input and suggestions for clarity. We intend for\nthese additional organization details to be used by app developers to help them map\norganizations to endpoints which, in turn, helps patients find the organization(s) they want to\nallow an app to access data from. We clarify that facility or organization level identifiers are\nsufficient to satisfy our proposed publication requirements. Facility level identifiers, for the\npurposes of certification to these Endpoint publication requirements, include identifiers such as:\na National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)\nnumber, CMS Certification Number (CCN), or other health system ID. Support for one of these\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentifier types is sufficient, meaning Certified API Developers are not required to publish\nindividual NPIs as a floor for certification. Different identifiers may be used depending on the\ncustomers a Certified API Developer has. We have updated our regulatory text at\n§ 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B) to more clearly state that “[e]ach Organization resource must contain the\norganization’s name, location, and facility identifier.”\n\nFor clarity and consistency, we have also updated our regulatory text at § 170.404(b)(2),\nand the relevant preamble text in this final rule, to replace the word “organizational” with\n“organization.” The phrase “organization details” more accurately represents the details we are\nreferring to and is a consistent phrase to use in lieu of our mixed use of “organizational” and\n“organization” in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\nRegarding the comment on the active work on a National Directory FHIR IG, we thank\nthis commenter for pointing this out. Because we have not required the publication of individual\nprovider-level identifiers, we are not considering this IG for the endpoint publication use case in\nour Program. We emphasize again that because we have finalized an approach in § 170.404(b)(2)\nthat references the base FHIR standard, Certified API Developers have the flexibility to consider\nusing “Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources profiles, such as the profiles in the\nNational Directory FHIR IG, to meet those requirements.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters asked that we clarify our requirements for elements\nin the Endpoint and Organization FHIR resources if we are updating to US Core version 6.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters and we note that, given the changes we have made\nto § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) (see response to comments above), US Core is no longer in scope. We\nhave modified the standard referenced in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to require the use of the base FHIR\n“Organization” resource instead of a US Core-profiled “Organization” resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters responded to our invitation for comment on whether we\nshould finalize our proposal to adopt a requirement for FHIR Endpoint and Organization\nresources to be made publicly available according to the FHIR Bundle format or if we should\nfinalize the requirement to use a ndjson format. These commenters were generally split on which\nformat they prefer. One commenter noted that large FHIR Bundles are challenging to parse.\n\nAnother commenter suggested that we align with a format that is most compatible with Lantern\nto support certification.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these responses and suggestions from commenters. We have\nfinalized, at § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(A), our requirement for FHIR Endpoint and Organization\nresources to be collected in FHIR Bundle resource format. We recognize that large FHIR\nBundles may be hard to parse given their size, but we anticipate that app developers will have the\ntechnology and access to the tools needed to parse large machine-readable artifacts. We also note\nthat the current draft Patient-access Brands specification calls for the use of FHIR Bundles to\ncollect FHIR Endpoint and Organization details.<sup>172</sup>\nWe believe that our finalized requirement for\npublication using the FHIR Bundle resource format sufficiently supports app developers and\naligns with industry direction.\n\nWe thank commenters for supporting Lantern, which is an open-source tool developed by\nONC and the MITRE corporation “that monitors and provides analytics about the availability\nand adoption of FHIR API service base URLs (endpoints) across healthcare organizations in the\nUnited States.”<sup>173</sup>\nWe anticipate that Lantern and other FHIR tools will be able to take advantage\nof our standards-based and machine-readable approach to monitor and discover FHIR endpoints.\n\n\nFootnote 172:\nhttps://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/branches/pab/brands.html\n\n\nFootnote 173:\nhttps://lantern.healthit.gov/?tab=dashboard_tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also note that the Program will continue to explore ways to support conformance and\ncertification to these requirements to enable patients and other users to access, exchange, and use\ninformation via discoverable FHIR APIs.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that both human readable and machine-readable\nEndpoint metadata be made available on the CHPL.\n\n*Response.* We thank this commenter for their suggestion. We acknowledge that human\nreadable Endpoint metadata may be useful for some use cases, but we do not believe that is a\nnecessary additional requirement to put on Certified API Developers in our Program. We note\nthat by requiring machine-readable publication using a standardized FHIR format, developers\ncan consider developing their own tools or leveraging existing community tools (e.g., Lantern)\nthat render FHIR data into human readable formats.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter explicitly expressed support for the quarterly review timeline\nwe proposed for Certified API Developers in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B), while two commenters\nrecommended changes to the timeline. The two commenters who recommended changes\nindicated that a quarterly review minimum was too long given that inaccurate organization\ndetails and non-functioning endpoints significantly hinders interoperability. One of these two\ncommenters suggested the review timeline be one week and the other suggested that ONC notify\norganizations of any inaccurate information after 30 days and find them in violation if no\ncorrective updates are made after 60 days.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and thoughtful suggestions for possible\nimprovement from commenters. We agree that this information needs to remain up to date to\nensure application developers can easily and consistently provide patients access to EHI. We also\nacknowledge the need to consider the burden on Certified API Developers to keep their\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomers’ endpoint information up to date. To balance value and burden, we have finalized the\nreview timeline as proposed and have finalized a quarterly review timeline as the requirement. In\nresponse to commenters’ suggestion that ONC monitor and notify interested parties of inaccurate\ninformation and initiate corrective action after 60 days, we note that we have a defined process to\nelevate concerns of non-conformity and we urge users or other interested parties to leverage this\nprocess.<sup>174</sup>\nComments. Many commenters suggested that ONC work on a process for validating and\nmonitoring these endpoints. Many of these commenters also suggested that we develop a\ndirectory of these endpoints. One commenter specifically cited our Lantern tool as a central place\nwhere these endpoints could be submitted and validated.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback and suggestions. All Certified\nAPI Developer published Endpoint and Organization FHIR resource Bundles will be available\npublicly via the CHPL. Links to these Bundles are collected during the certification process by\nthe ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACB) and posted on a product’s CHPL listing\nfollowing successful certification. This public data can be used by anyone for collection and\nmonitoring. This includes ONC’s open-source Lantern tool. ONC hosts a public instance of this\ntool at https://lantern.healthit.gov/ and collects data into this instance from many sources,\nincluding the CHPL, to monitor and provide analytics about the availability and adoption of\nFHIR API endpoints.<sup>175</sup>\nWe encourage interested parties to visit the Lantern tool and we will\ncontinue to consider ways to ensure that service base URLs required in the Program continue to\nsupport individuals’ access to their health information.\n\n\nFootnote 174:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/certified-health-it-complaint-process\n\n\nFootnote 175:\nhttps://lantern.healthit.gov/?tab=about_tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters expressed concern over the burdens and challenges for\nEHR developers to collect this information from their customers and be responsible for it being\nup to date. This included comments that Certified API Developers should not be penalized if and\nwhen their customers do not provide this information. One commenter asked that ONC clarify\nthat Certified API Developers can rely on assurances provided by their customers that this\ninformation is valid and up to date, because it will not be feasible for developers to\nindependently validate the information, and that Certified API Developers should instead only be\nexpected to publish information for customers that provide details to the Certified API\nDevelopers, rather than an expectation that endpoint and organization detail lists are\ncomprehensive. A couple of commenters suggested the introduction of a CMS attestation for\nproviders and hospitals to be responsible for this information and keeping it up to date.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters and acknowledge these\nconcerns from Certified API Developers about gathering endpoint and organization information\nfrom their customers and being responsible for its publication. However, we did not propose and\nhave not finalized any changes to our existing policy at § 170.404(b)(2) that requires Certified\nAPI Developers to publicly publish the service base URLs for all of their customers regardless of\nwhether the Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are centrally managed by the\nCertified API Developer or locally deployed by an API Information Source. As we said in the\nONC Cures Act Final Rule with regards to publication of service base URLs, we believe that\nCertified API Developers will have adequate relationships with API Information Sources in the\nprocess of providing Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) to gather the necessary\ninformation (85 FR 25765). We believe that these same relationships are adequate for Certified\nAPI Developers to be able to collect and publish service base URLs, organization names,\n\n\n\n\n\n\norganization locations, and facility identifiers on behalf of their customers. We do not agree that\nit will be infeasible for Certified API Developers to provide validated URLs for customers that\nlocally deploy certified API technology because details related to customer names, organization\nlocations, and facility identifiers should be routinely and readily available during the business\nprocess (i.e., a Certified API Developer licensing or selling use of certified API technology to a\ncustomer). We remind commenters of our focus for this criterion on service base URLs and\nrelated organization details for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) that can be used\nby patients to access their EHI. We believe that the effort needed to collect this information is\nwarranted given the critical role it plays in enabling third-party apps to access EHI at a patient’s\nrequest.\n\nWe appreciate the feedback and suggestions from commenters on potential points of\nintersection between our requirements and CMS requirements. Updates to CMS programs are\nout of scope of this rule, but we encourage commenters to submit such ideas to CMS.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters suggested that we work with CMS and other federal\npartners to ensure our requirements do not duplicate other efforts and to ensure that the necessary\ninfrastructure is in place to support this requirement. One commenter specifically cited CMS’s\nongoing effort to develop a national directory.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We will continue to coordinate\nand work with our federal partners, including CMS, on points of intersection for potential future\nrulemaking.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we established a requirement in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi)\nthat for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10), the Health IT Module’s authorization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserver must be able to revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction (85 FR\n25945). This required capability is intended to enable patients to “definitively revoke an\napplication’s authorization to receive their EHI until reauthorized, if ever, by the patient” (85 FR\n25747). We noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that we finalized § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) as a\nfunctional requirement to allow health IT developers the ability to implement it in a way that best\nsuits their existing infrastructure and allows for innovative models for authorization revocation to\ndevelop (85 FR 25747). We understand that a lack of specificity in the current requirement has\nled to some confusion among health IT developers and application developers.\n\nAs part of health IT developers’ implementation of these requirements, we have received\nfeedback regarding the implementation of authorization revocation, specifically around the\nrevocation of access tokens. Health IT developers have requested clarification regarding letting\naccess tokens expire in lieu of immediate access token revocation for the purposes of\ncertification testing. The Oauth 2.0 Token Revocation specification, RFC 7009, describes\nexpiration of short-lived access tokens as a design option for authorization servers to revoke an\napplication’s access. This design option conforms with industry standard practice and may\nreduce health IT developer burden as the Health IT Module would not have to perform token\nintrospection for each resource request nor maintain a database of valid access tokens.\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to revise the requirement in §\n170.315(g)(10)(vi) to specify that a Health IT Module’s authorization server must be able to\nrevoke and must revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction within 1 hour\nof the request (88 FR 23816). This requirement aligns with industry standard practice of short-\nlived access tokens as specified in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments (RFC) 6819,<sup>176</sup>\nIETF RFC 7009,<sup>177</sup>\nand Section 7.1.3 of the SMART Application\nLaunch Framework version 1.0.0, which states that “Access tokens SHOULD have a valid\nlifetime no greater than one hour. Confidential clients may be issued longer-lived tokens than\npublic clients.” This policy would provide clarity and create a consistent expectation that\ndevelopers revoke access within 1 hour of a request, regardless of their internal approach to\nfulfilling a patient’s request to revoke access. This policy would also assure patients that once\nrequested, an application’s access to their data would be revoked within 1 hour. This would also\nsupport situations where a patient may have an unexpected change in their privacy concerns and\nseek to curtail access to their information.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported our proposal to revise\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(vi) to specify that a Health IT Module’s authorization server must be able to\nrevoke and must revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction within 1 hour\nof the request. Several commenters, including health IT companies, medical software companies,\nprofessional trade associations, some healthcare systems, and consumer/patient advocacy groups\nagreed with our rationale that such a requirement supported patients’ direct control over the\napplications that have access to their EHI, and that the requirement is consistent with industry\nstandards.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We believe our proposal would\nassure patients that once requested, an application’s access to their data would be revoked within\n1 hour and that such revocation could be supported by all Health IT Modules regardless of their\ninternal approach to fulfilling a patient’s request to revoke access. We appreciate the overall\n\n\nFootnote 176:\nAvailable at: https://www.rfc-editor.org/pdfrfc/rfc6819.txt.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 177:\nAvailable at: https://www.rfc-editor.org/pdfrfc/rfc7009.txt.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrong support for our proposal that, for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10), the\nHealth IT Module’s authorization server must be able to revoke and must revoke an authorized\napplication’s access at a patient’s direction within 1 hour of the request. We have adopted our\nproposal in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) without revisions.\n\n*Comments.* A small number of commenters opposed our proposal, for differing reasons.\n\nA healthcare system and a medical software company commented that 1 hour is too long a period\nof time to execute a revocation request, and a trade organization said 1 hour was too short. Two\ncommenters worried about implications related to information blocking, including a professional\ntrade association that said that providers should be able to request that an app developer delete\nany data received through the API between when the request was made and when access had\nbeen revoked without trigging information blocking concerns, and a medical software company\nworried about information blocking claims if revocation within 1 hour was not feasible due to\ntechnical challenges, such as a network outage at a cloud provider.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these commenters’ concerns. However, we note that this\nproposed requirement aligns with industry standard practice of short-lived access tokens as\nspecified in IETF RFCs 6819 and 7009. We also note that this 1-hour requirement does not\npreclude a Health IT Module from revoking access in a shorter timeframe; rather, it establishes a\nmaximum timeframe for the revocation of access once requested. Based on community feedback,\nwe respectfully disagree with the commenter indicating that 1 hour is not enough time to process\nsuch a request; industry consensus, as discussed above with the IETF RFCs, and experience with\nimplementing the Program requirement to-date, indicates that many, if not most, requests can be\neasily fulfilled within 1 hour. We have established this timeframe to clearly delineate Program\nexpectations, which did not previously exist. Finally, we appreciate commenters’ concerns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregarding information blocking; however, we currently do not provide an exception specific to\naccess token revocation and we decline to do so at this time. We also invite readers to review the\ndiscussion regarding the Infeasibility Exception, finalized by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule in §\n171.204 (85 FR 25866 – 25875), and our discussion of the Infeasibility Exception and its\nresponding to requests condition (§ 171.204(b)) discussed in section IV.C.1 of this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter from a health system recommends that the ONC liaise with\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to consider introducing a requirement such that, when\nconsumer apps that access, exchange, or use personal health records experience a breach and are\nrequired to notify users of such a breach, those apps also include easy-to-understand instructions\nabout how to revoke access to that application via certified health IT products and the timeframe\nin which such revocation must occur.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and will continue to coordinate and work with our\nfederal partners, including the FTC, on points of intersection for potential future rulemaking.\n\nWe appreciate the overall strong support for our proposal that a Health IT Module’s\nauthorization server must be able to revoke and must revoke an authorized application’s access at\na patient’s direction within 1 hour of the request and we have adopted our proposal in\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(vi) without revisions.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we adopted the HL7 FHIR SMART Application\nLaunch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART v1 Guide), a profile of the\nOauth 2.0 specification, in § 170.215(a)(3) (85 FR 25741). The SMART v1 Guide provides\nreliable, secure authorization for a variety of app architectures through the use of the Oauth 2.0\nstandard. This IG defines various capabilities for app support, known as the “SMART on FHIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Capabilities” (85 FR 25741). As part of adopting the implementation specification in §\n170.215(a)(3), the ONC Cures Act Final Rule required support for these “SMART Core\nCapabilities,” which enable applications to securely perform standardized authentication and\nauthorization as part of enabling receipt of patient EHI via a FHIR API.\n\nIn the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, the § 170.315(g)(10) “Standardized API for patient\nand population services” certification criterion required support for capabilities from the\nSMART v1 Guide as described in § 170.215(a)(3) to enable apps to securely perform\nauthentication and authorization with the Health IT Module in a standardized manner.\n\nAdditionally, the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion included additional requirements for technical\ncapabilities specified in the SMART v1 Guide, requiring support for the issuance of “refresh\ntokens” valid for a period of no less than three months. This requirement was intended to reduce\npatient and provider burden to receive patient EHI using an application of their choice by\npotentially reducing the number of re-authorizations of the application. Support for refresh\ntokens facilitates patient and provider receipt of patient EHI by enabling an application to be\nauthorized to receive data in a persistent manner, without requiring re-authorization of the\napplication while the refresh token is valid. The § 170.315(g)(10) criterion required support for\nthe issuance of refresh tokens valid for a period of no less than three months, so that an\napplication could potentially be authorized to receive patient EHI for at least a three-month\nperiod without requiring re-authorization.\n\nAs part of the adopted implementation specification, we explicitly required mandatory\nsupport of the “SMART Core Capabilities” for Program testing and certification, and we stated\nthat by requiring the “permission-patient” “SMART Core Capability” in § 170.215(a)(3), Health\nIT Modules presented for testing and certification to § 170.315(g)(10), via cross-references to §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.215(a)(3), must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their\nelectronic health information (EHI) based on FHIR resource-level scopes (85 FR 25741, 25746).\n\nPractically, this means that patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their\nEHI at the individual FHIR resource-level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g.,\n“Immunization”) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in\n§ 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(2). This capability gives\npatients increased control over how much EHI they authorize applications of their choice to\nreceive.\n\nThe SMART App Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0 (SMART v2 Guide) is\nthe next major release of the SMART App Launch IG.<sup>178</sup>\nThe SMART v2 Guide updates the\nfeatures of the SMART v1 Guide by including revisions aligning with industry consensus to\nprovide technical improvements and reflect security best practices. The SMART v2 Guide\ntechnical enhancements improve the authentication and authorization security layer provided by\nthe SMART v1 Guide and enables increased capabilities and functionality for individual control\nof EHI. Therefore, we proposed to adopt the SMART v2 Guide in § 170.215(c)(2), and we\nproposed that the adoption of the SMART v1 Guide in § 170.215(c)(1) would expire as of\nJanuary 1, 2025 (88 FR 23816). We clarified that both the SMART v1 Guide and SMART v2\nGuide will be available for purposes of certification where certification criteria reference §\n170.215(c) until the expiration date of January 1, 2025, after which time only the SMART v2\nGuide will be available for certification.\n\n\nFootnote 178:\nhttps://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/STU2/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of this proposal, we proposed to adopt several sections specified as “optional” in\nthe SMART v2 Guide as “required” for purposes of the Program for certification criteria that\nreference § 170.215(c). Specifically, we proposed to adopt all Capabilities as defined in “8.1.2\nCapabilities,” which include but are not limited to (1) backward compatibility mapping for\nSMART v1 scopes as defined in “3.0.2 Scopes for requesting clinical data;” (2) asymmetric\nclient authentication as defined in “5 Client Authentication: Asymmetric (public key);” and\ngranular scopes as defined in (3) “3.0.2.3 Finer-grained resource constraints using search\nparameters.” Additionally, we proposed to require support for the “Patient Access for Standalone\nApps” and “Clinician Access for EHR Launch” Capability Sets from “8.1.1 Capability Sets.”\n\nAlso, we proposed to adopt token introspection as defined in “7 Token Introspection.” Again, we\nclarified that for the period before January 1, 2025, Health IT Modules certified to certification\ncriteria that reference § 170.215(c) may use either SMART v1 or SMART v2 for certification\n(88 FR 23817).\n\nFurther, we noted that the SMART v2 Guide includes section 3.0.2.3 “Finer-grained\nresource constraints using search parameters,” and associated “3.0.2.4 requirement for support”\nand “3.0.2.5 experimental features,” which present concepts for further development within the\nSMART v2 Guide (88 FR 23817). Together, these optional functionalities will enable more\ngranular control for individuals, clinicians, and other users to share information with apps of\ntheir choice in more explicit ways. The granular scope functionality would empower patients and\nproviders to share health data in a more granular fashion, which would improve confidence in the\nuse of third-party apps by allowing app users to decide which specific type of EHI they share\nwith the app. These functionalities would help address privacy and security concerns of third-\nparty app access to health data and further patient empowerment by providing the ability to limit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan app’s access to a granular, minimum set of health data, as determined by the app user. We\nproposed these sections for adoption as part of SMART v2 Guide with the understanding that\neither the SMART v2 Guide or another implementation guide such as the US Core\nImplementation Guide will define more specific requirements for finer-grained resource\nconstraints using search parameters.\n\n*Comments.* There was near universal support for adoption of the SMART v2 Guide\namong commenters, including health IT companies, software and IT firms, advocacy\norganizations, and health systems. Several commenters noted that the SMART v2 Guide would\nplay a crucial role in promoting health data interoperability and facilitating seamless data\nexchange between healthcare systems and applications. However, there was strong support\namong many of these interested parties to adopt the newest balloted version of the SMART App\nLaunch Implementation Guide, Release 2.1. (SMART v2.1 Guide), rather than the SMART v2\nGuide. Several commenters highlighted the benefits of the SMART v2.1 Guide, including\nimproved FHIR Context management and App State capability. Some commenters also\nrecommended ONC require support for browser-based apps, including requirements from the\nSMART v2.1 Guide.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support. We have finalized the adoption of\nthe SMART v2 Guide subject to modifications described later in this section. We believe that\nadoption of the SMART v2 Guide will enable an improved and more secure authorization\nprocess for applications to receive EHI from Health IT Modules. We appreciate commenters’\ninput regarding adoption of the subsequent release of the SMART v2.1 Guide. We acknowledge\nthere are noteworthy updates included in the SMART v2.1 Guide. However, given that the\nSMART v2 Guide has already been an established part of the Program via SVAP and rigorously\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntested as a result, we believe adopting the SMART v2 Guide as a baseline requirement is more\nappropriate at this time. We will consider potential ways the SMART v2.1 Guide could be\nincluded in the Program in the future, including through SVAP. We also clarify that browser-\nbased apps fitting the definition of “public clients”, or “native applications” as defined in Internet\nEngineering Task Force Request for Comments 6749 (RFC 6749), are required to be supported\nby Health IT Modules certified to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion, per the requirements of that\ncriterion. Such relevant requirements for supporting “public clients” and “native applications”\ninclude the data response, search, registration, secure connection, authentication and\nauthorization for patient and user scopes, and authorization revocation requirements in the §\n170.315(g)(10) criterion, respectively at § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A), § 170.315(g)(10)(ii)(A), §\n170.315(g)(10)(iii), § 170.315(g)(10)(iv)(A), § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A), and § 170.315(g)(10)(vi).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were mixed in their recommendations on our proposal to expire\nthe use of the SMART v1 Guide as part of the Program on January 1, 2025, effectively requiring\nuse of only the SMART v2 Guide for applicable certification criteria after that date. Among\nthose interested parties that commented, professional associations urged ONC to finalize the\ntimeline as proposed. Health information technology companies and one health system requested\nadditional time, indicating that the proposed expiration timeframe of January 1, 2025, does not\ngive organizations sufficient time to develop, test, and implement necessary changes to systems\nand processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input. We acknowledge the benefits of\nextending the timeframe in which the SMART v1 Guide is available for certification. Taking this\ninto consideration, we have modified our proposal as suggested by commenters who\nrecommended more time to adopt only the SMART v2 Guide. We have, therefore, finalized our\nmodified proposal that the adoption of the SMART v1 Guide implementation specification\nexpires on January 1, 2026, and we clarify that following expiration of the SMART v1 Guide,\nthe SMART v2 Guide will be the only valid standard for certification criteria that reference\n§ 170.215(c).\n\n\n",

                      "text": "The SMART v2 Guide introduces new or revised requirements to the previous version of\nthe implementation guide, SMART v1 Guide. Major requirements new to the SMART v2 Guide\ninclude support for the OAuth 2.0 security extension Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), as\nwell as a revision of the scope syntax. The SMART v2 Guide includes requirements that both the\nEHR and all apps support the OAuth 2.0 security extension PKCE. PKCE is an industry standard\nsecurity extension for OAuth 2.0 to mitigate the known security vulnerability of authorization\ncode interception attacks.<sup>179</sup>\nThe requirement of support for PKCE especially improves the\nsecurity of native apps, or apps that operate from an individual’s phone or tablet, which were\nparticularly vulnerable to authorization code interception attacks.\n\nAnother major change included in the SMART v2 Guide is revision of the syntax of\nscopes provided to apps. To align with the FHIR interactions of “Create,” “Read,” “Update,”\n\n“Delete,” “Search,” collectively known as “CRUDS,” scopes are constructed to consist of\n\n\nFootnote 179:\nhttps://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncombinations of five types of permissions corresponding to the CRUDS interactions. The use of\nthis CRUDS scope syntax permits improved patient choice for persistent access as more specific\ncombinations of permissions can be granted to apps as opposed to the scope syntax used in the\nSMART v1 Guide, which only used two permission types of “read” and “write.”\n\nNew feature: PKCE\nOne of the major security improvements in the SMART v2 Guide is the requirement that\nall apps support the OAuth 2.0 security extension Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). PKCE\nis designed to mitigate the known security vulnerability of authorization code interception\nattacks, with native apps especially targeted. According to IETF RFC 7636,<sup>180</sup>\nthe request for\ncomment which defines the PKCE extension, this attack can be used to illegitimately obtain an\naccess token from the authorization server and thus obtain server data in an unauthorized\nmanner. PKCE mitigates this vulnerability by creating cryptographically random keys for every\nauthorization request. The authorization server performs proof of possession of the secret key by\nthe client. This mitigates the vulnerability as an attacker who intercepts the authorization code\ncannot redeem it for an access token as they do not possess the secret key associated with the\nauthorization request.\n\nSupport for PKCE is important because PKCE makes health app access of patient health\ninformation more secure in a standardized manner. ONC recognizes healthcare participants and\npatients are interested in the secure use of health apps, including native apps, to access health\ninformation. PKCE support makes the granting of access to health information via health apps\nmore secure by mitigating the known vulnerability of authorization code interception attacks. We\n\n\nFootnote 180:\nSee IETF RFC 7636 at: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbelieve the support of PKCE would further our goal of secure access of health information\nwithout special effort by further securing health app access, especially for native apps. Therefore,\nwe proposed to require the support of PKCE as specified in the SMART v2 Guide (88 FR\n23817).\n\n*Comments.* All comments received from interested parties supported adoption of the\nOAuth 2.0 security extension PKCE in the SMART v2 Guide. Many commenters noted that\nadoption and required support for PKCE is aligned with industry best practice and forthcoming\nupdates to OAuth in draft version 2.1.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support. We believe the support of PKCE\nwould further our goal of secure access of health information without special effort by further\nsecuring health app access, especially for native apps. Therefore, we have finalized adoption of\nthe SMART v2 guide with inclusion of PKCE. This means that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification to § 170.315(g)(10) must support PKCE.\n\nNew Feature: CRUDS scope syntax\nAnother major update in the SMART v2 Guide is the revision of the scope syntax to align\nwith the FHIR REST API interactions for FHIR resources. Previously in the SMART v1 Guide,\nscope syntax for FHIR resources was delineated in terms of combinations of “read” and “write”\npermissions. The SMART v2 Guide revises this scope syntax by splitting “read” permissions\ninto two types of permissions which correspond to FHIR REST API interactions, “Read” and\n“Search.” Similarly, the “write” permissions from the SMART v1 Guide are split into “Create,”\n\n“Update,” and “Delete.” This alignment of scope syntax to the FHIR REST API interactions\npermits Health IT Module authorization servers to provide greater specificity regarding which\npermissions are granted in scopes to apps and has the benefit of improved technical clarity to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT and application developers. This additional specificity for scopes also improves a\npatient’s control over how an app accesses their health data by clarifying for the patient what\nspecific type of API interactions are permitted to the app. For example, under this new syntax the\npatient could specifically permit an app “read” access to a FHIR resource but deny “search”\naccess for the same FHIR resource.\n\nAs stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25742, the § 170.315(g)(10)\ncertification criterion only requires health IT developers to support “read” capabilities according\nto the standard and implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(a) and in §\n170.215(b)(1), including the mandatory capabilities described in “US Core Server Capability\nStatement.” Our proposal aligns with this existing policy for § 170.315(g)(10) by proposing to\nrequire that only “Read” and “Search” permissions as specified in the SMART v2 Guide be\nsupported for certification to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion.\n\n*Comments.* Comments from health IT companies supported our proposals to adopt the\nSMART v2 revised scope syntax of “Create,” “Read,” “Update,” “Delete,” and “Search,” or\nCRUDS. They noted that the new syntax supports flexible and patient-friendly user interfaces\n(UI). One commenter noted that ONC should maintain current policy allowing developers the\nflexibility to present authorization scopes in a more user-friendly format, such as by logically\ngrouping FHIR resource-level scopes, as long as users are able to grant FHIR resource-level\nscope authorizations, if requested. We also received a comment recommending against requiring\nsupport for wildcard scopes as defined in the SMART v2 Guide due to concerns about data\nmanagement and security in patient access use cases.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support and comments. In consideration of\nthe comments received, we have finalized as proposed the requirement for Health IT Modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertified to § 170.315(g)(10) to support the SMART v2 scope syntax for the “Read” and\n“Search” permissions as specified in the SMART v2 Guide. We clarify that Health IT Modules\nsupporting the SMART v2 Guide scope syntax and the “permission-patient” capability from the\nSMART v2 Guide are not required to support wildcard scopes relating to authorization to receive\na single patient’s data. Instead, we align with the policy as mentioned in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25741) that as part of supporting the “permission-patient” capability, Health\nIT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to\nauthorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes.\n\n\n",

                      "title": "ii. SMART v2 Optional Features Proposed as Required by ONC",
                      "text": "We proposed to require all Capabilities as defined in “8.1.2 Capabilities” and the “Patient\nAccess for Standalone Apps” and “Clinician Access for EHR Launch” Capability Sets from\n“8.1.1 Capability Sets” (88 FR 23817 through 23819). First, the SMART v2 Guide introduces\nfunctionality specified as optional in the implementation guide. We proposed to make several of\nthese optional functionalities required as part of the proposed implementation specification, and\ntherefore required for certification criteria that reference proposed § 170.215(c)(2) (88 FR\n23818).\n\nSecond, the SMART v2 Guide introduces an optional profile for authorization servers to\nsupport asymmetric client authentication for confidential clients. We proposed to require Health\nIT Modules support asymmetric client authentication as an option for confidential clients during\nthe process of authentication and authorization when granting access to patient data.\n\nThird, the SMART v2 Guide also introduces a new optional feature of granular scope\nconstraints using search parameters. This feature uses the FHIR REST API search parameter\nsyntax to specify permissions more granular than the FHIR resource level, which was the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum granularity of scopes in the SMART v1 Guide. We proposed to require “3.0.2.3 Finer-\ngrained resource constraints using search parameters” with the clarification that Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) must minimally be capable of handling finer-grained\nscopes using the “category” parameter for (1) the Condition resource with Condition sub-\nresources Encounter Diagnosis, Problem List, and Health Concern and (2) the Observation\nresource with Observation sub-resources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH,\nSurvey, and Vital Signs. We note that the requirements denoted in “3.0.2.3 Finer-grained\nresource constraints using search parameters” would be required as part of implementing the\n“permission-v2” capability defined in “8.1.2 Capabilities”. We anticipated that the US Core IG\nwould provide guidance for developers to support a minimum number of search parameters, and\nthis minimum list would be consistent with the optional scopes described in section “3.8 Future\nof US Core” of the US Core IG v6.1.0.\n\nFourth, the SMART v2 Guide revises how capabilities are categorized. The “SMART\nCore Capabilities” in the SMART v1 Guide define capabilities supported by the server and are\nmade available to inform clients of supported functionality. “Capabilities” are grouped into\n“Capability Sets” to define the functionalities required for a specific use case. The SMART v2\nGuide restructures how “Capabilities” are organized, and no longer includes “SMART Core\nCapabilities.” Instead, the SMART v2 Guide includes a list of “Capabilities” and “Capability\nSets.”\n\nFinally, the SMART v2 Guide introduces a new requirement to support POST-based\nauthorization for the client authorization request. This new requirement in the SMART v2 Guide\nis adapted from the OpenID Connect Core specification and is related to the requirement in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(i), which requires a Health IT Module to support authentication and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nauthorization during the process of granting access to patient data according to the SMART App\nLaunch and OpenID Connect Core standards. The SMART v2 Guide includes the “authorize-\npost” capability under “Capabilities” for servers to indicate support for this requirement. To align\nwith this new technical requirement in the SMART v2 Guide and the authorization and\nauthentication requirement in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(i), we proposed to require the\n“authorize-post” capability (88 FR 23819).\n\nComment. Overall, commenters were supportive of ONC’s proposals to adopt optional\nfeatures in the SMART v2 Guide as required for the Program. Several commenters supported\nadoption of all optional features; several others supported adoption of all optional features except\nfor “authorize-post” capability (also referred to as HTTP POST by commenters); and a minority\nof commenters also commented against including the “permission-online” capability. There was\na comment recommending revision to the language of the token introspection proposal in\n§ 170.315(g)(10)(vii), since the SMART v1 Guide does not include a guidance section regarding\ntoken introspection. We also received a comment requesting clarity regarding requirements to\nindependently support SMART v2 scopes separately from SMART v1 scopes.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support and comments. We believe\nrequiring the proposed optional features will improve the capability of applications to be\nauthorized by users to securely receive EHI. We clarify the “authorize-post” capability is not an\noptional capability and is required as per the SMART v2 Guide as a method to obtain an\nauthorization code from the authorization server. To align with the requirement as per the\nimplementation guide, we have finalized the proposal to require the “authorize-post” capability.\n\nWe encourage interested parties to participate in the development of the SMART App Launch IG\nif there are enhancements or technological advances regarding this capability. We proposed to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire the “permission-online” capability, as part of our proposal to require all “Capabilities” as\ndefined in “8.1.2 Capabilities,” which would enable an application to receive authorization to\nreceive EHI while the user is logged in. In consideration of comments we received, we believe\nadditional clarity is necessary regarding the specific authorization contexts in which this\ncapability would be required. Also, further insight is needed regarding the use cases in which this\ncapability provides utility beyond the “permission-offline” capability included in the proposal.\n\nTherefore, we are modifying our proposal to exclude the “permission-online” capability from the\nrequirements of § 170.215(c)(2). Thus, we have finalized our proposal to require all Capabilities\nas defined in “8.1.2 Capabilities” and the “Patient Access for Standalone Apps” and “Clinician\nAccess for EHR Launch” Capability Sets from “8.1.1 Capability Sets” of the SMART v2 Guide,\nexcept for the “permission-online” capability. We also note that since we have finalized our\nproposal to expire use of the SMART v1 Guide as part of the Program on January 1, 2026, that\nafter that date certification to § 170.315(g)(10) would effectively require that token introspection\nbe supported as described in the SMART v2 Guide. Additionally, regarding independently\nsupporting SMART v2 and SMART v1 scopes, we note that this proposal requires the\n“permission-v1” and “permission-v2” capabilities as defined in the SMART v2 Guide, which\ndefine how such scopes must be supported. We clarify that the SMART v2 Guide scopes must be\nsupported independently of the SMART v1 Guide scopes as per the “permission-v2” capability\nin the SMART v2 Guide, and that the SMART v1 Guide scopes must be supported as per the\n“permission-v1” capability in the SMART v2 Guide. Support for scopes in this manner enables\nthe updated SMART v2 Guide scope syntax to be used by applications while also maintaining\nbackwards compatibility with the SMART v1 Guide scopes for legacy applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We received support from a majority of commenters that addressed ONC’s\nproposals for support of the SMART v2 Guide’s optional capability “3.0.2.3 Finer-grained\nresource constraints using search parameters,” including our proposal to use the “category”\nparameter for (1) the Condition resource with Condition sub-resources Encounter Diagnosis,\nProblem List, and Health Concern and (2) the Observation resource with Observation sub-\nresources Clinical Test, Laboratory, Social History, SDOH, Survey, and Vital Signs. Multiple\ncommenters appreciated this degree of specificity and encouraged ONC to finalize this approach\nwithout further specifying in future rulemaking; instead, many of these commenters said ONC\nshould rely on future versions of the US Core Implementation Guide to instruct further\nspecification of other FHIR resource constraints. One health IT company recommended that we\ndo not align scopes requirements to “search operations,” and instead adopt authorization scopes\nno more granular than the “category” level for FHIR resources such as Condition, Observation,\nMedication Request, and Diagnostic Report.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback and have finalized the requirements as\nproposed. We note that the finalized requirements regarding “3.0.2.3 Finer-grained resource\nconstraints using search parameters” are required as part of implementing the “permission-v2”\ncapability defined in “8.1.2 Capabilities”. We also note that the requirements of this proposal to\nsupport finer-grained scopes using search parameter syntax and the “category” parameter are\nintended to align with capabilities and guidance as included in the SMART v2 Guide and FHIR\nUS Core 6.1.0 implementation guide. We believe that establishing minimal conformance\nrequirements at the category level for the Condition and Observation resources using\nspecifications and guidance from these implementation guides will both ensure that Health IT\nModules are capable of supporting the finer-grained resource constraints capability without\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeing overly prescriptive in setting expectations for how the Health IT Module implements such\ncapabilities.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that ONC adopt capabilities and standards that\nwere outside the scope of our proposals, including “rich authorization requests,” “push\nauthorization requests, as defined by RFC 9126,” and anti-malware capabilities, identity threat\ndetection and response systems, the adoption of sender-constrained tokens, and OAuth 2.0\nDemonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) specification.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their recommendations, but we note that these\ncomments are outside the scope of our proposals. We decline to accept the recommendations to\nadopt these capabilities, but we encourage industry to continue highlighting potential capabilities\nfor future consideration in the Program. We also encourage interested parties to participate in the\ndevelopment and refinement of standards and implementation guides such as the SMART App\nLaunch Implementation Guide.\n\n\n",

              "title": "8. Patient Demographics and Observations Certification Criterion in § 170.315(a)(5)",
              "text": "In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 62601), ONC required the recording, capture, and\naccess to a patient’s sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity for Health IT Modules certified\nto the “Demographics” certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) (80 FR 62747). This rule also\ndefined a required set of standardized terminology to represent each of these data elements (80\nFR 62618-62620). Since then, ONC has received recommendations through the Health\nInformation Technology Advisory Committee (HITAC) and public feedback that the current\nterms and terminologies used to represent sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are limited\nand need to be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the healthcare industry had similarly taken note of the need for precision for\nideas encompassed in terms such as “sex” and “gender” and launched the Gender Harmony\nProject<sup>181</sup>\nto capture these concepts consistently within healthcare. The Gender Harmony Project\nintroduced for the health IT context the concepts “Sex for Clinical Use” (SFCU), “Recorded Sex\nor Gender” (RSG), “Name to Use,” and “Pronouns.” The Gender Harmony Project defines Sex\nfor Clinical Use as a category that is based on clinical observations typically associated with the\ndesignation of male and female; Name to Use provides the name that should be used when\naddressing or referencing the patient; Recorded Sex or Gender is the documentation of a specific\ninstance of sex and/or gender information; and Pronouns are determined by a patient and used\nwhen referring to the patient in speech, clinical notes, and in written instructions to caregivers\n(e.g., she/her/hers or they/them). Sex for Clinical Use, Name to Use, Recorded Sex or Gender,\nand Pronouns are currently not present in the certification criteria.\n\nWe outline our proposals as discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to modify the\n“Demographics” certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) (88 FR 23820):\nWe proposed to rename § 170.315(a)(5) from “demographics” to “patient demographics\nand observations,” to acknowledge that the data elements being proposed are broader than\ndemographics information, as we look to promote a more inclusive healthcare system.\n\nWe proposed to add the data elements “Sex for Clinical Use” in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(F),\n“Name to Use” in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(G), and “Pronouns” in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(H) to the “patient\ndemographics and observations” certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)). This addition reflects\n\n\nFootnote 181:\nhttps://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/The+Gender+Harmony+Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcepts developed by the HL7 Gender Harmony Project and help promote inclusivity in care\ndelivery.\n\nWe proposed to revise the terminology standards specified for “Sex” in §\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(C). Prior to issuing the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, ONC received significant\nfeedback reflecting the need to be more inclusive in the terminology representing the data\nelement. As such, ONC proposed to revise the fixed list of terms for “Sex” in §\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(C), which are represented by HL7® Value Sets for Administrative Gender and\nNullFlavor in § 170.207(n)(1). We proposed to ultimately replace § 170.207(n)(1) with the\nSNOMED CT® U.S. Edition code set proposed in § 170.207(n)(2). In order to be less disruptive\nto developers of certified health IT, we proposed to provide flexibility and allow recording the\nelement using the specific codes represented in § 170.207(n)(1) for the time period up to and\nincluding December 31, 2025, to provide enough time to transition their health IT systems to\nSNOMED CT® U.S. Edition by January 1, 2026. By having § 170.207(n)(1) expire at the end of\n2025 and adding § 170.207(n)(2) as a requirement for Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(a)(5) beginning January 1, 2026, we proposed to enable health IT developers to specify\nany appropriate value from the SNOMED CT® U.S. Edition code set with the standard specified\nin § 170.207(n)(2). We proposed to require that Sex for Clinical Use must be coded in\naccordance with, at a minimum, the version of LOINC® codes specified in § 170.207(c)(1).\n\nAdditionally, we proposed to replace the terminology standards specified for Sexual\nOrientation in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D), and Gender Identity in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)I. ONC has\nreceived significant feedback reflecting the need to be more inclusive in the terminology\nrepresenting each of these data elements. As such, ONC proposed to revise the fixed list of terms\nfor Sexual Orientation in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D), and Gender Identity in § 170.315(a)(5)I(E),\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich are represented by SNOMED CT ® U.S. Edition and HL7® Value Set for NullFlavor in\n§ 170.207(o)(1) and (2), and ultimately replace it with the SNOMED CT ® U.S. Edition code set\nspecified in § 170.207(o)(3).\n\nWe further proposed to set an expiration date of January 1, 2026, for the adoption of the\nvalues sets referenced in § 170.207(o)(1) and (o)(2). This allows the use of either the value sets\nin § 170.207(o)(1) and (o)(2) or the standard proposed in § 170.207(o)(3) beginning on the\neffective date of a final rule and transitioning to allow only the use of the adopted standard in\n§ 170.207(o)(3) after December 31, 2025. Consistent with our policies in sections III.A and\nIII.C.11, developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to criteria that\nreference § 170.207(o)(1) or (o)(2) would have to update those Health IT Modules to §\n170.207(o)(3) and provide them to customers by January 1, 2026.\n\nWe also proposed to add Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU) as a new data element in §\n170.315(a)(5)(i)(F). SFCU is a category based upon clinical observations typically associated\nwith the designation of male and female. It supports context specificity, is derived from\nobservable information, and is preferably directly linked to the information this element\nsummarizes. SFCU represents a patient’s sex relevant to a specific clinical setting. This is\nvaluable when providing care for a patient whose condition or treatment is dependent on their\nsex as determined by observing and evaluating, for example, a patient’s hormonal values, organ\ninventory, genetic observations, or external genital morphology. SFCU may differ from a\npatient’s sex as recorded on a birth certificate or driver’s license. We further clarified, that while\nthere may be multiple values of SFCU tied to different events, such as requesting a laboratory\ntest or imaging study, we proposed to require health IT developer be able to record at least one\nvalue of SFCU. Additionally, in order to align with current industry practice and to provide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflexibility to health IT developers, we proposed that health IT be capable of recording SFCU\nusing the LOINC® terminology code set standard specified in proposed § 170.207(n)(3).\n\nWe proposed to add new data elements Name to Use in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(G) and\nPronouns in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(H), respectively, to advance the culturally competent care for\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and all sexual and gender minority\n(LGBTQIA+) people. Multiple values for a given patient may be valid over time. We require at\nleast one value for Pronouns and Name to Use be recorded. Additionally, in order to align with\ncurrent industry practice and to provide flexibility to health IT developers, we proposed that\nhealth IT be capable of recording Pronouns using the LOINC® terminology code set standard\nspecified in proposed § 170.207(o)(4).\n\nIn addition to the other data elements proposed, the HL7 Gender Harmony Project\ncreated an element named Recorded Sex or Gender (RSG). RSG documents a specific instance\nof sex and/or gender information. RSG is considered a complex data element that includes\nprovision for a sex or gender value, as well as reference to the source document where the value\nwas found, whereas Sex is a simple data element. RSG provides an opportunity for health IT\ndevelopers to differentiate between sex or gender information that exists in a document or\nrecord, and from Sex for Clinical Use (SFCU) which is designed to be used for clinical decision-\nmaking. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, ONC asked commenters to evaluate two options and\nprovide feedback regarding whether Recorded Sex or Gender as defined by the HL7 Gender\nHarmony Project should be incorporated into 170.315(“)(5) \"patient demographics and\nobservations” (88 FR 23820).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters did not support the proposed deadline and instead\nsuggested a deadline of 24 months after the effective date of the final rule as this would be in line\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the proposed “timeliness” provisions of the Assurances Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements. Other commenters specifically proposed December 31, 2025, for the\nadoption of new and updated certification criteria.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for the comments suggesting an extension to the\nproposed effective dates. In assessing the overall burden and proposed timeframes, we have\nrevised the compliance dates to allow for 24 months for compliance and finalized the adoption of\n§ 170.315(a)(5) with a compliance date of January 1, 2026. We have also revised the\n“timeliness” requirement in the Assurances Condition to avoid confusion.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters supported the addition of Sex for Clinical Use, Name to\nUse, Sex, and Pronouns to § 170.315(a)(5) “patient demographics and observations.” Some\ncommenters noted that comprehensive demographic data supports holistic understanding of\npatients’ background, leading to culturally competent and patient-centered care. Commenters\nalso encouraged ONC to continue collaborating with the HL7 Gender Harmony Project to\nprovide more detail regarding the definitions and supporting terminologies – supporting the\nability for people to provide more nuanced information about themselves to best inform care.\n\nCommenters also suggested that ONC explore how Sex for Clinical Use could be expanded to\nincorporate organ inventory and hormone levels. One commenter suggested that ONC promote\nSex for Clinical Use as a repeatable set of observations. Another commenter suggested that the\naddition of Pronouns, Name to Use, and Sex for Clinical Use would create unnecessary\nconfusion, increased medical risk, and religious conscience concerns. Other commenters\nexpressed concern that it will be difficult to collect Sex for Clinical Use as the clinician\ninteracting with the patient may not have the information necessary to provide a value. Some\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenters expressed concern about the complexities of dealing with context-specific Sex for\nClinical Use data.\n\nSome commenters expressed concern that there is not sufficient information or guidance\nfor programs and health IT to implement Sex for Clinical Use, therefore it should not be included\nin § 170.315(a)(5) “patient demographics and observations.” Several commenters suggested that\nONC wait to add any data elements to “patient demographics and observations” until the data\nelements are part of USCDI. Other commenters supported the addition of Sex for Clinical Use,\nName to Use and Pronouns to the “patient demographics and observations” criterion rather than\nUSCDI, as adding to USCDI and then SVAP would greatly slow adoption since SVAP is\noptional.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks the commenters expressing support for Name to Use, Pronouns,\nand Sex for Clinical Use. Including “patient demographics and observations” criterion in this\nfinal rule provides time for Health IT Modules to incorporate support for capture of this\nimportant data prior to requiring exchange.\n\nONC collaborates closely with the HL7 Gender Harmony project team and as a result has\nfinalized the descriptive data name change of “Sex for Clinical Use” to “Sex Parameter for\nClinical Use” in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(F). ONC will continue to support efforts to expand the scope\nof the HL7 Gender Harmony Project to explore how more specific information about a person’s\nphysical characteristics (e.g., organ inventory and hormone levels) can be collected and\nexchanged to inform Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. We have finalized as proposed (88 FR\n23820) that the Health IT Module must be able to record at least one value for Sex Parameter for\nClinical Use for each patient and note that there may also be multiple values tied to different\nevents, such as requesting a laboratory test or imaging study, allowing for and encouraging more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthan one. We recognize that the Sex Parameter for Clinical Use data element may be a new\nconcept to some. However, we note that developers of certified health IT have the flexibility to\nconfigure their user interface and to capture and display these data in clinical workflows\nconsistent with their own design decisions.\n\nONC appreciates the concerns expressed by some commenters about lack of guidance to\nimplement Sex Parameter for Clinical Use (formerly Sex for Clinical Use); however, at the time\nof this final rule, HL7 has published updated specifications that provide specific exchange\nguidance that may then inform incorporation into health IT workflows. ONC has identified Sex\nParameter for Clinical Use, Name to Use, and Pronouns as key to implementing ONC’s priorities\nto support health equity and access for LGBTQIA+ communities. We have also finalized what\nwas proposed to specify that at least one Name to Use and Pronouns must be recorded for each\npatient.\n\nWith regards to the comment suggesting that collection of these data elements would\ncreate unnecessary confusion, increased medical risk, and religious conscience concerns, ONC\nbelieves that these data elements are critical to supporting healthcare, health equity, and access\nfor LGBTQIA+ communities. Our adoption of these data elements will help to advance the\ncapability of certified health IT to exchange these data elements for use by patients and health\ncare providers. Our adoption of these data elements does not establish a requirement for health\ncare providers or patients to record or disclose this information, or use these capabilities. As\nstated above, these data elements may be new concepts to some, and ONC encourages\ndevelopers of certified health IT to work with providers to develop appropriate workflows.\n\nThe “patient demographics and observations” criterion focuses on data capture and\nstorage and not the exchange of this data, which is the focus of USCDI. Therefore, we did not\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccept the comment suggesting that ONC not include the data elements in § 170.315(a)(5)\n“patient demographics and observations” until they are included USCDI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested that ONC remove Sex and retain Sex for Clinical Use\nbecause Sex for Clinical Use paired with Gender Identity provides clear information to\ndistinguish between a clinical categorization of a person’s sex used for clinical decision making\nand a person’s self-reported Gender Identity.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks commenters for their input suggesting that Sex be removed and\nSex Parameter for Clinical Use (as we have renamed Sex for Clinical Use) be retained. However,\nmore analysis by the health IT community is necessary to determine the impact of removing Sex.\n\nTherefore, ONC declines to remove Sex.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters did not support changing the title from patient\ndemographics to patient demographics and observations, noting that all data described within are\nconsidered demographics. Other commenters noted that the title change is confusing as the\ncriterion now includes statistical characteristics of human populations used to identify population\nsegments and attributes associated with a diagnostic test or procedure.\n\n*Response.* We disagree with the stated concerns and do not believe that the certification\ncriterion name change will be confusing to most in the healthcare ecosystem. The addition of the\nword “observations” signals that some of the data elements in this data class may not be\nstatistical characteristics of human populations by all people evaluating the certification criterion.\n\nAccordingly, we have finalized the criterion title change as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* Multiple commenters expressed concern about changing the requirement for\nspecific code set concepts for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity to a more general reference\nto SNOMED CT U.S. Edition. They also questioned whether health IT developers would be\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompliant if other values are exchanged such as “unknown” or “asked but did not answer.” Other\ncommenters supported ONC’s plans to move value set definitions out of regulatory text and\ndelegate to industry groups. One commenter suggested referencing specific value sets defined in\nthe Value Set Authority Center.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks the commenters for their input and assures them that ONC\ncollaborates with health IT developers to develop specific values that may be exchanged,\nincluding those that indicate a standard value is not available, such as “unknown” or “asked but\ndid not answer”. The resulting value sets may be defined in the Value Set Authority Center.\n\nRemoving specific code set concepts from regulation allows health IT developers to provide\noptions that are culturally relevant and may change on a cycle that is different from regulation.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters did not support the addition of Sex with the requirement\nthat data values be drawn from SNOMED CT U.S. Edition. Others expressed concern that the\naddition of Sex may increase confusion among senders and receivers about the various data\nelements currently in use – administrative sex, administrative gender, and sex (assigned at birth).\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks the commenters for their input regarding Sex. Health IT Modules\nmay continue to record and exchange Sex (assigned at birth). Historically, Sex (assigned at\nbirth), administrative sex, and administrative gender have been used to communicate sex which\nmay be used for clinical decision making when the values were obtained from a document at\nsome point in a patient’s life or were not based on clinical observations and should not be used\nfor clinical decision making. The addition of Sex allows health IT developers to exchange Sex\nwithout relying on document context.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested that ONC remove the “patient demographics\nand observations” criterion entirely and rely on USCDI to promote the capture, use, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexchange of patient demographic data elements. Others suggested that all data elements listed in\nthe “patient demographics and observations” criterion should be in USCDI prior to inclusion in\nregulation. These commenters referenced cases where ONC withdrew certification criteria (e.g.,\nProblem List, Medication List, Smoking Status).\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks the commenters and acknowledges that certification criteria have\nbeen withdrawn in the past. ONC declines to remove the ”patient demographics and\nobservations” criterion or change the scope of USCDI to include data capture and use.\n\nThe “patient demographics and observations” certification criterion includes important\ndata elements supporting underserved communities and health equity. The USCDI scope is\nfocused on the exchange of data element values, whereas this certification criterion focuses on\nhealth IT capabilities to collect and record certain data. In some cases, the data required to be\ncollected and recorded is not yet in USCDI.\n\n*Comments.* In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, proposals for § 170.315(a)(5), ONC asked\ncommenters to provide feedback regarding whether Recorded Sex or Gender as defined by the\nGender Harmony Project should be incorporated into the § 170.315(a)(5) “patient demographics\nand observations” criterion. Responses indicate there is not agreement among interested parties,\nand many open issues remain related to how and when these data should be collected. One\ncommenter suggested that ONC remove the Sex data element entirely and add Recorded Sex or\nGender to delineate administrative information from Sex for Clinical Use, which is to be used\nwhen making clinical decisions.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks commenters for their thoughtful input and will not finalize the\naddition of Recorded Sex or Gender to § 170.315(a)(5) due to lack of community consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONC will continue to support maturation of this data element through the Gender Harmony\nProject at HL7.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters encouraged ONC to work with interested parties to\nprovide clarity on the differences between related data elements to ensure patients’ identities are\nrespected while important information for clinical care is captured correctly. Specifically,\nsharing this information via a patient access API, such as those required by the CMS quality\nprograms for health care providers under Medicare, may cause confusion or distress to a patient.\n\nCommenters also noted that care must be taken to ensure privacy controls are in place to protect\nsensitive, granular health data. This information may be sold or disclosed by an application\ndeveloper if agreed to in the consumer terms and agreement.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their comments regarding privacy concerns and\nrecognize the importance of addressing the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information.\n\nRecognizing this, the Program establishes the standards, implementation specifications, and\nfunctional requirements for health IT to manage and exchange data but does not control the\ncollection or use of data. For more on patient requested restrictions on sharing of their health\ninformation, we refer readers to section III.C.10 on modifications to the “view, download, and\ntransmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1), which addresses patients’ (and\ntheir authorized representatives’) ability to use an internet-based method to request a restriction\nto be applied for any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213.\n\nBase EHR Definition\nWe proposed to revise and update the “demographics” certification criterion (§\n170.315(a)(5)), to rename as “patient demographics and observations,” and which is included in\nthe Base EHR definition in § 170.102 (88 FR 23821). This means Health IT Modules would\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneed to be updated to accommodate the additional requirements in the “patient demographics\nand observations” certification criterion in order to meet the Base EHR definition. We did not\nreceive comments related to updating the Base EHR definition to include the additional\nrequirements in the “patient demographics and observations” certification criterion, so we have\nfinalized this revision as proposed.\n\nIn addition, because December 31, 2022 has passed, we proposed to revise the Base EHR\ndefinition by removing the reference to § 170.315(g)(8) in § 170.102 Base EHR Definition (3)(ii)\nand replacing the references to § 170.315(g)(10) in § 170.102 Base EHR Definition (3)(ii) and\n(iii) with a single reference to § 170.315(g)(10) in § 170.102 Base EHR Definition (3)(i). We did\nnot receive comments on this proposal, so we have finalized this revision as proposed.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We proposed to replace the fixed value set for the USCDI data element “Sex” and instead\nenable health IT developers to specify any appropriate value from the SNOMED CT U.S.\n\nEdition code set with the standard specified in § 170.207(n)(2) (88 FR 23821). We proposed that\nhealth IT developers can continue using the specific codes for Sex represented in § 170.207(n)(1)\nfor the time period up to and including December 31, 2025. We note that these dates were\nproposed for the adoption of the associated standards in § 170.207(n), including the expiration of\nthe adoption of the standard in § 170.207(n)(1) on January 1, 2026. As discussed in sections III.A\nand III.C.11, developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to criteria that\nreference § 170.207(n)(1) would have to update those Health IT Modules to § 170.207(n)(2) and\nprovide them to customers by January 1, 2026. We note that, in the proposed rule regulation text\nin § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3), we inadvertently included a reference to § 170.213 (88 FR 23909)\ninstead of including § 170.207(n)(2) as discussed in our proposal (88 FR 23821). ONC has not\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinalized § 170.213 as proposed in § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3), as § 170.213 references a version\nof SNOMED CT U.S. Edition that is older than the one referenced in § 170.207(n)(2). We have\nfinalized the reference to § 170.207(n)(2) in § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) to include the most recent\nversion of SNOMED CT U.S. Edition available at the time of publication of this final rule.\n\nHealth IT developers may update to a newer version if one exists at effective date of the\ncriterion.\n\nWe also proposed a conforming update to § 170.315(b)(1) to update the listed minimum\nstandard code sets for Problems in § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(B)(2) (88 FR 23821). We proposed that\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(1) use, at a minimum, the version of the standard\nspecified in § 170.207(a)(1).\n\n*Comments.* All commenters agreed with the proposal to update the transitions of care\ncertification criterion § 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)(3) to include the adoption of USCDI v3 in §\n170.213(b). Some commenters noted that the updated criterion will allow better inpatient –\noutpatient transitions, especially for community health centers.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks commenters for their support to update the transitions of care\ncertification criterion to include the adoption of USCDI v3. We have finalized the adoption of\nthis proposal in this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter encouraged ONC to work across HHS to enforce existing\nCMS and ONC requirements across products and healthcare organizations. The commenter\nsuggests that HHS should extend transition of care data elements for claims data from payers to\nhealthcare organizations offering primary care.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks the commenter for their input. ONC will continue to work with\nfederal partners to promote alignment for these data concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested that the date to support USCDI v3 in\nTransitions of Care documents should be changed to December 31, 2025, or 24 months after the\nrule is finalized to allow health IT developers time to incorporate and test USCDI v3 data\nelements into Health IT Modules and develop appropriate safeguards for sensitive personal\nhealth information.\n\n*Response.* ONC appreciates concerns expressed about the proposed date to allow for\nUSCDI v3 adoption prior to including USCDI v3 data elements in transition of care documents.\n\nWe have finalized the adoption of updates to § 170.315(b)(1) with a compliance date of January\n1, 2026.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern about USCDI data element Sex and its\ninclusion in patient matching algorithms, suggesting that time of birth is a better matching\nparameter than Sex. Other commenters suggested that mother’s maiden name (in a child’s\nrecord), birth order, and multiple birth indicators be added to the patient matching requirement.\n\n*Response.* ONC thanks commenters for their input concerning appropriate data to include\nin patient matching algorithms. The transitions of care criterion define the minimum set of data\nelements to use for patient matching and does not inhibit health IT developers from using other\nadditional data elements.\n\n\n",

              "title": "10. Patient Right to Request a Restriction on Use or Disclosure",
              "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we noted that under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered\nentities, as defined in 45 CFR 160.103, are required to allow individuals to request a restriction\non the use or disclosure of their PHI for treatment, payment, or health care operations, although\nit does not require covered entities to accept such requests, except in certain limited\ncircumstances (See 45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)) and 164.530(i)) (88 FR 23821). The HIPAA Privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule also requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures with respect to PHI that\nare designed to comply with the standards, implementation specifications, or other requirements\nof the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including the individual right to request restrictions (See 45 CFR\n164.530(i)(1)). We stated that we believe that certified health IT should support covered entities\nso they can execute these processes to protect individuals’ privacy and to provide patients an\nopportunity to exercise this right to the extent feasible. However, we also noted that patient-\ndirected privacy of data the patient deems sensitive requires attention to specific technology and\npolicy challenges, which we recognize are not easily solved (88 FR 23821).\n\nWe proposed a new certification criterion in § 170.315(d)(14), an addition to ONC’s\nPrivacy and Security Framework under the Program in § 170.550(h), and a revision to an\nexisting “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) to\nsupport additional tools for implementing patient requested privacy restrictions (88 FR 23822\nthrough 23824).\n\nWe proposed to adopt a new certification criterion “patient requested restrictions” in §\n170.315(d)(14) to enable a user to implement a process to restrict uses or disclosures of data in\nresponse to a patient request when such restriction is agreed to by the covered entity (88 FR\n23822). This criterion was proposed specifically in support of the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s\nindividual right to request restriction of certain uses and disclosures (See also 45 CFR\n164.522(a)). We proposed that this new criterion in § 170.315(d)(14) would be standards-\nagnostic, allowing health IT developers seeking to certify a Health IT Module to the criterion\nflexibility in how they design these capabilities as long as they meet the functional requirements\ndescribed for certification. We specifically intended the proposed § 170.315(d)(14) to advance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe technological means to support clinicians and other covered entities when honoring patient\nrequests for the restriction of uses or disclosure of PHI through certified health IT.\n\nWe proposed to add the following in § 170.315(d)(14) for this new criterion “patient\nrequested restrictions”:\n• For any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213, enable a user to flag whether such\ndata needs to be restricted from being subsequently used or disclosed; as set forth in 45\nCFR 164.522; and\n• prevent any data flagged pursuant to paragraph (d)(14)(i) of this section from being\nincluded in a subsequent use or disclosure for the restricted purpose.\n\nWe proposed that “enabl[ing] a user to flag” means enabling the user of the Health IT\nModule to indicate that a request for restriction was made by the patient and that the user intends\nto honor the request. We noted that in the case of integration with a Health IT Module certified\nto the revised criterion in § 170.315(e)(1), that request made by the patient could be in part\nautomated for requests made through an internet-based method. However, the functionality\nunder the proposed new criterion in § 170.315(d)(14) would include the ability for the user to\nindicate a request made via other means. We noted that such “flags” may leverage use of security\nlabels like those included in the HL7 data segmentation for privacy (DS4P) implementation\nguides discussed in section III.C.10.b of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, or other data standards such\nas provenance or digital signature specifications.<sup>182</sup>\nWe also noted that the use of such standards\n\n\nFootnote 182:\nFor example, the USCDI v3 includes a provenance data class (https://www.healthit.gov/isa/uscdi-data-\nclass/provenance#uscdi-v3) and submissions in ISA include digital signature as a potential addition to provenance\nwithin the USCDI: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/uscdi-data/signature. Further specifications for provenance data and\ndigital signatures in the context of FHIR-based transactions are also referenced in ISA:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/representing-data-provenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor specifications would be at the discretion of the health IT developer, and they would have the\nflexibility to implement the “enable a user to flag” functionality in the manner that works best for\ntheir users and systems integration expectations.\n\nWe proposed that the developer of a certified Health IT Module, under the proposed\nstandards-agnostic approach, would have the flexibility to implement the restriction on the\ninclusion in a subsequent use or disclosure via a wide range of potential means dependent on\ntheir specific development and implementation constraints (e.g., flagged data would not be\nincluded as part of a summary care record, not be displayed in a patient portal, or not be shared\nvia an API). We proposed and sought comment on several alternatives which would add\nstandards to the proposed new criterion and would specifically leverage HL7 dS4P IGs for the\nnew criterion in § 170.315(d)(14). We also proposed and sought comment on alternate proposals\nthat looked exclusively at the HL7 Privacy and Security Healthcare Classification System (HCS)\nSecurity Label Vocabulary within the HL7 dS4P IGs for a source taxonomy for the “flag”\napplied to the data (88 FR 23822).\n\nWe also proposed to modify the Privacy and Security Framework in § 170.550(h) to add\nthe proposed new criterion. Specifically, we proposed to modify § 170.550(h)(iii) in reference to\nthe certain of “care coordination” certification criteria in § 170.315(b); § 170.550(h)(v) in\nreference to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in §\n170.315(e)(1); and to § 170.550(h)(viii) in reference to the § “application access” certification\ncriteria at § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9) and the “standardized API for patient and population\nservices” certification criterion at § 170.315(g)(10).\n\nWe proposed that the new “patient requested restrictions” certification criterion in §\n170.315(d)(14) would be required for the Privacy and Security Framework by January 1, 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also proposed a modification to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party”\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) to support patients’ ability to leverage technology to\nexercise their right to request restrictions of uses and disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nWe proposed that a Health IT Module certified to the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) must also\nenable an internet-based approach for patients to request a restriction of use or disclosure of their\nEHI for any data expressed in the USCDI standards in § 170.213. Specifically, we proposed to\nmodify § 170.315(e)(1) to add a paragraph (iii) stating patients (and their authorized\nrepresentatives) must be able to use an internet-based method to request a restriction to be\napplied for any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213.\n\nWe proposed that conformance with this update to the “view, download, and transmit to\n3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1)(iii) would be required by January 1, 2026, for\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(e)(1). Consistent with our proposals in sections III.A\nand III.C.11 of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, developers of certified health IT with Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(e)(1) would have to update those Health IT Modules to §\n170.315(e)(1)(iii) and provide them to customers by January 1, 2026.\n\nWe did not propose any changes to the current certification criteria for “security–tags -\nsummary of–care - send “ and “security–tags - summary of care – receive” in § 170.315(b)(7)\nand § 170.315(b)(8) respectively; however, we noted that the inclusion of the proposed new\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(d)(14) into the Privacy and Security Framework in\n§ 170.550(h) would mean that the proposed new certification criterion would be applicable for\nHealth IT Modules certified to the “security tags—send” and “security tags—receive”\ncertification criteria as well (88 FR 23822 – 23823). We sought comment on whether those\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertification criteria should also be directly modified in alignment with the proposals described\nin this section (88 FR 23823).\n\nWe sought comment on the capabilities we have proposed for the new criterion in\nrelation to the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual right to request restriction of uses and disclosures\nof PHI. We specifically sought comment on whether the proposed new criterion should include\nadditional functions to better support compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual right\nto request restriction of uses and disclosures of PHI. We also sought comment on whether the\nproposed new criterion should, for example, include capabilities to support HIPAA Privacy Rule\nprovisions for emergency disclosures in § 164.522(a)(1)(iii) and (iv) or termination of a\nrestriction under § 164.522(a)(2).\n\nWe sought public comment on each part of this proposal—the new criterion in\n§ 170.315(d)(14), the inclusion of the request capability for patients in § 170.315(e)(1), and the\nrequirements with the Privacy and Security Framework in § 170.550(h)—both separately and as\na whole. We specifically sought comment on the feasibility of each part in terms of technical\nimplementation and usefulness for patients and covered entities using these capabilities. We\nsought comment on the health IT development burden associated with implementation of the\ncapabilities including for the individual certification criterion referenced in the Privacy and\nSecurity Framework in § 170.550(h).\n\nIn addition, we sought comment on any unintended consequences that the new criterion\nin § 170.315(d)(14) or the addition to the Privacy and Security Framework in § 170.550(h) might\nplace on patients, clinicians, or other covered entities using certified health IT. We sought\ncomment on whether, and by how much, the use of this criterion as part of broader privacy\nworkflows might represent a reduction in manual effort for covered entities, a positive impact on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuptake by patients, or other benefits such as supporting documentation of restrictions as required\nunder the HIPAA Privacy Rule in § 164.522(a)(3).\n\nFinally, we sought comment on methods by which we might quantify the development\nburden and costs as well as the potential benefits or future cost savings for the new criterion in\n§ 170.315(d)(14), the new functionality in the existing criterion in § 170.315(e)(1), and the\naddition to the Privacy and Security Framework in § 170.550(h).\n\n*Comments.* Overall, in response to our new proposal for Patient Requested Restrictions\nCriterion in § 170.315(d)(14), we received mixed input for our proposals and our alternative\nproposals from interested parties. Comments ranged from full support to limited support\nexpressing various technical and policy considerations all the way to full opposition because of\ntechnical, policy, and patient care concerns. Multiple commenters expressed support for the\nintent behind the proposal, noting its potential to empower patients to take ownership of their\ndata, while ensuring that providers are not engaging in information blocking for automated data\nflows and expressed support for the development and implementation of data segmentation\ntechnology. Multiple commenters supported giving patients a reasonable opportunity and the\ntechnical capability to make informed decisions about the collection, use, and disclosure of their\nEHI, noting that the functionality is increasingly necessary for ensuring patient trust.\n\nHowever, in most instances where support was indicated, it was conditional. In these\ninstances, commenters indicated concern with the implementation of the proposal, noting that if\nONC were to finalize the proposal then it should be mindful of numerous considerations and\nchallenges. Concerns ranged across many broad policy and technical topics including but not\nlimited to implementation feasibility, unintended consequences such as impacts on patient safety\nand provider burden, implementation timeline and approach, importance of patient education,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand intersections with existing information blocking policy as well as the Trusted Exchange\nFramework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).\n\nMultiple commenters questioned the readiness of real-world tested, national standards\nand specifications for this proposal. One commenter suggested that developers should be given\nflexibility in implementing the criterion, given the breadth of activities, workflows and features\nin which patient data is used. Some suggested that adopting a standards-agnostic approach will\nallow health IT developers to determine appropriate implementation in their own systems and\ncould lead to the future development of new, consensus-based standards informed by robust real-\nworld implementation experience across a broad set of developers and health care provider\norganizations. However, multiple commenters recommended the criterion be standards-based, as\nbased on past examples, a standards-agnostic approach would likely not successfully lead the\nprivate sector to come to consensus on their own. Some commenters indicated support for HL7\nFHIR DS4P IG but felt it was not clear that it has been adequately tested and deployed in the\nfield. Such commenters stated that ONC should move forward with support for implementations\nand test them before deploying as a requirement. One commenter indicated ONC should instead\nlook at FHIR for future rulemaking. Multiple commenters recommended that we focus on\nestablishing, with the relevant Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) as well as other\nrelevant groups, a common infrastructure that enables patients to only document their consent\nrules once, while having a common definition of all relevant privacy rules across US\njurisdictions. Multiple commenters recommended federally funded connectathons and other\npolicy-driven approaches to stimulate the developer community to implement toward a particular\nuse case with the purpose of advancing standards development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also received comments indicating strong opposition to the new proposal for patient\nrequested restrictions criterion in § 170.315(d)(14). Commenters opposing the proposal shared a\nsimilar sentiment to those supporting the proposal provided certain conditions were met. These\ncommenters stated that it is not feasible for developers to support every permutation on the use\nof data that a patient might request and that the proposed criterion may not provide enough\ncontrol to help patients manage the complexities of their information. Commenters highlighted\nthe complexity of managing and scaling a consent management infrastructure, especially across\nall the data sources where the patient’s data is available. Others noted this proposal runs a high\nrisk of allowing for a wide variety of misaligned implementation, and some felt it would increase\nburden and undermine benefits of interoperability.\n\nMultiple commenters suggested that, if adopted, the new proposed criterion in §\n170.315(d)(14) should be optional and that adoption of the criterion within the privacy and\nsecurity framework in § 170.550(h) should not be required before CY 2030. Commenters noted\nthat significant work would be required by health IT developers, including reconfiguration of\nexisting EHR systems as well as other interconnected systems related to treatment, payment and\noperations and that ONC should allow for a 3-year implementation cycle, 2 years to develop, test\nand certify, and at least 1 year to roll-out the proposed criterion to customers and update\nworkflows. In response to our request for comment related to the development burden (88 FR\n23823), commenters estimated up to one-million hours for preliminary development and rollout,\nplus additional ongoing maintenance requirements.\n\nWe received several comments regarding how to achieve policy goals through alternative\napproaches and factors that should be taken into consideration – including several that are out of\nscope of ONC authorities, but informative of the need for alignment to related privacy laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral commenters stated ONC should better align with other regulators and have more explicit\nworkflows on privacy and patient consent before adopting this proposed certification criterion in\n§ 170.315(d)(14). One commenter also suggested that this criterion’s functionality support\nproviders implementing information sharing practices in compliance with potential future\npolicies to protect sensitive health information regarding “highly politicized lawful health care\nservices.” Multiple commenters recommended introducing a functional requirement aligning\nwith the HIPAA right to request corrections and amendments to erroneous information to ensure\npatients have an easy path to requesting corrections or amendments to their PHI through patient\nportals and APIs. They also felt that this would drive participation in standardization efforts\nthrough independent patient-led governance bodies. One commenter suggested that this work be\nfunded and supported by the institutions sharing the data and driving these exchanges, and the\ncommenter encouraged use of established patient-created resources to evaluate fairness of\nengagement with patient communities. Several commenters focused on our proposals in relation\nto other related regulations. These commenters indicated that ONC should work with other\nagencies to focus on ensuring there are streamlined and complementary privacy regulations.\n\nThey additionally commented that any new privacy related regulation gets compared and cross\nreferenced across existing and pending ones to support policy alignment.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their thoughtful input addressing both the\nentirety of the proposals and specific areas of concern. As noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\n(see, for example, 88 FR 23821), we proposed requirements for Health IT Modules certified\nunder the Program to support workflows and specifications that would enable an individual to\nexercise their right to request restriction of uses and disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nWe expressed our concerns about feasibility, timelines, and the overall complexity of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworkflows and the related capabilities associated with this right as well as our intent to propose\nseveral options for consideration by the healthcare and health IT communities. Based on the\nmixed input we received on the proposed new criterion in § 170.315(d)(14) and the inclusion of\nthe criterion in the privacy and security framework in § 170.550(h), and the strong concerns\nregarding its implementation feasibility by interested parties opposing these proposals, we have\nconcluded that we should not finalize the proposals at this time. Our decision to not finalize the\ncriterion in § 170.315(d)(14) is informed by the range of comments expressing concern with\nsuccessfully implementing the proposal. In particular, there was no clear consensus on whether\nand how to proceed either with immature and untested standards or without the required use of\nspecific standards for the certification criterion at § 170.315(d)(14). We agree with the concerns\non the high risk of allowing Health IT Modules to implement a wide variety of misaligned\nstandards and implementation specifications, as well as increased burden on developers of\ncertified health IT, care providers, health information exchange networks, and a high probability\nof confusion for patients.\n\nWe note that those supporting our proposals for § 170.315(d)(14) did so to varying\ndegrees, often extending conditional support while raising the same broad technical and policy\nconsiderations and concerns as those opposed to the proposal. Outright support on\n§ 170.315(d)(14) as proposed, or for the various alternate proposals, was not as common as\nconditional support or opposition. The specific suggestions for such conditional support were\nvaried and would introduce substantial additional detailed specification well beyond the scope of\nour proposal and the standards in the alternate proposals. Based on this input, there is no clear\nand consistent approach at this time to effectively address all commenter concerns. Therefore,\nwe have not finalized the specific proposal to adopt a new certification criterion in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(d)(14). We also have not finalized corresponding modifications related to this\nproposed criterion’s in ONC’s Privacy and Security Framework in § 170.550(h). We will\ncontinue to encourage and engage with industry and standards development community efforts to\nadvance standards supporting privacy workflows and to monitor the continued evolution of the\nHL7 DS4P IGs to consider new criteria in future rulemaking.\n\nIn consideration of those commenters who articulated full support, we recognize the\nimportance of empowering patients to take ownership of their data and continue to support\nefforts to develop the technical capability for patients to leverage certified health IT to take\naffirmative action regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of their EHI. We note that we\nhave maintained the existing criteria in § 170.315(b)(7) and § 170.315(b)(8) which support the\napplication and persistence of security labels for document-based exchange and reference the\nstandards adopted in § 170.205(o)(1), the HL7 Implementation Guide: Data Segmentation for\nPrivacy (DS4P), Release 1 (HL7 CDA DS4P IG) incorporated by reference in § 170.299. These\ntwo criteria require a Health IT Module to (1) enable a user to create a summary record that is\ntagged as restricted and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure and (2) enable a user to receive a\nsummary record that is tagged as restricted and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure and to\npreserve privacy markings. The use of Health IT Modules certified to these two criteria can\nsupport privacy and security labels based on consent and with respect to sharing and re-\ndisclosure restrictions. As noted, these existing criteria utilize the HL7 CDA DS4P IG, and\ninclude the use of the taxonomy of reference (HCS Security Label Vocabulary) for the purposes\nof applying and identifying standardized security labels on health information at the document,\nsegment, or data element level. These existing certification criteria can be leveraged during\ntransitions of care and sending/receiving summary of care records (i.e., combined with Health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(1)) and we encourage purchasers of certified health IT to\nexplore the use and incorporation of these capabilities in their Health IT Modules.\n\nWe recognize the concerns of both commenters supporting the application of standards\nand those identifying a lack of readiness and gaps in the standards for the disposition of a\ndisclosure request based on our proposed new criterion. We also recognize those commenters\nwho advised a longer implementation timeline to refine and test standards. While we considered\ndelaying the implementation of our proposal to 2030, or beyond, we believe that Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(b)(7) and (b)(8) that use the HL7 CDA DS4P IG may serve as a\nbalanced approach to address these disparate concerns by applying the standard where feasible,\nwhile allowing broad flexibility for health IT developers to implement functionalities where the\nstandard is silent on core processes. We will continue to monitor uptake of the existing\ncertification criteria at § 170.315(b)(7) and § 170.315(b)(8), as well as continue to work with the\nhealthcare, health IT, and standards community to advance and evaluate the readiness and\npotential adoption in future rulemaking of the related HL7 FHIR DS4P IG, which is intended to\nsupport the same security label taxonomy (HCS Security Label Vocabulary) for health\ninformation exchange via standards-based APIs using the FHIR standard.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in relation to our proposal to update the\nexisting “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(1), to\nadd § 170.315(e)(1)(iii) to support additional tools for implementing patient requested privacy\nrestrictions (88 FR 23822 through 23824) through the inclusion of an “internet-based” method\nfor patients to request a restriction. Commenters were overwhelmingly supportive of the\nproposal to provide a means for patients to make a restriction request via Health IT Module.\n\nHowever, commenters expressed a wide range of related concerns ranging from the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocumentation of the request to potential consequences to consider when processing a patient’s\nrequests for restriction.\n\nOne commenter expressed concern that the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not (with certain\nexceptions) require a covered entity to restrict disclosure of an individual’s PHI if so requested.\n\nInstead, the covered entity is required to have a process for approving or denying the request, and\nthat decision is not under the individual’s control. One commenter recommended that the\ncertification criterion respect the individual’s request for privacy regardless of the covered\nentity’s perspective. However, another commenter noted that requiring the covered entity’s\napproval ensures that important health information is still available when medically necessary\nwhile balancing patient privacy and security concerns. One commenter stated that clinicians may\nhave a better understanding than individuals regarding which health data is relevant for their\ncare. Commenters also expressed concern regarding an obligation to accept an individual’s\nrequest for restriction. One commenter questioned how the lack of restriction on timelines for the\nrequest – such as the lookback period for the data or the length of time for which the restriction\nwould be applicable – could impact the clinician’s ability to make a reasoned judgment. Another\ncommenter expressed a number of legal concerns relating to concerns that clinicians may have to\ndefend refusals to comply with a patient’s request for restriction, or that compliance with the\npatient’s request which could place them in legal jeopardy for fraud, professional misconduct, or\ncriminal charges.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input and support of our proposal to\ninclude an internet-based method for an individual to request restriction of uses and disclosures\nconsistent with their right under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We have finalized this proposed\nrevision to the existing “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.315(e)(1) to support additional tools for implementing patient requested privacy\nrestrictions (88 FR 23822 through 23824) through the inclusion of an “internet-based” method\nfor patients to request restriction. Specifically, we have finalized in § 170.315(e)(1)(iii) a\nrequirement that Health IT Modules support patients (and their authorized representatives) to use\nan internet-based method to request a restriction to be applied for any data expressed in the\nstandards in § 170.213. We have also finalized that conformance with this paragraph is required\nby January 1, 2026.\n\nIn response to comments on whether a patient or health care provider may be best suited\nto determine if data should be private, or a covered entity’s obligation to accept a patient’s\nrequest, we reiterate our statement from the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that our intent is to advance\ntechnologies that support requirements already extant under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (88 FR\n23821). In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we described that the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides\nindividuals with several rights intended to empower them to be more active participants in\nmanaging their health information. These include the right to access certain health information\nmaintained about the individual; the right to have certain health information amended; the right\nto receive an accounting of certain disclosures; the right to receive adequate notice of a covered\nentity's privacy practices; the right to agree or object to, or authorize, certain disclosures; the\nright to request restrictions of certain uses and disclosures; and provisions allowing a covered\nentity to obtain consent for certain uses and disclosures. Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered\nentities as defined in 45 CFR 164.530(i) are required to allow individuals to request a restriction\non the use or disclosure of their PHI for treatment, payment, or health care operations and to\nhave policies in place by which to accept or deny such requests (See 45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)(i)(A)\nand (B)). The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not specify a particular process to be used by\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindividuals to make such requests or for the entity to accept or deny the request. However, we\nbelieve that certified health IT should—to the extent feasible—support covered entities so they\ncan execute these processes to protect individuals' privacy and to provide patients an opportunity\nto exercise this right (88 FR 23821).\n\nWe further stated that identifying which health data are defined as “sensitive” may vary\nacross federal or state laws and may further vary based on an individual’s perspective. Thus, the\nconcept of “sensitive data” is dynamic and specific to the individual. Patient populations that\nhave historically been subject to discrimination may identify a wide range of demographic\ninformation as sensitive, including race, ethnicity, preferred language, sex, sexual orientation,\ngender identity, and disability status—or patients may want to restrict health data that they view\nas sensitive, such as behavioral health or reproductive health-related data. These considerations\nfrom an individual’s perspective may not always coincide with a health care provider’s\nperspective. However, we believe that facilitating the ability of a patient to request such a\nrestriction, in addition to addressing patient considerations, may also provide additional context\nfor health care providers engaged in discussions with patients about their health information,\nsensitivities, and related concerns.\n\nIn response to commenters expressing concerns with timelines associated with requests,\nwe decline to specify any limitations and note that a health care provider might include an option\nfor an individual to specify such information as a part of the internet-based method for requests\nin § 170.315(e)(1).\n\nFor commenters expressing concerns related to legal liabilities, we reiterate that ONC\ncertifies capabilities of Health IT Modules to perform specific functions, in many circumstances\nusing specific standards. These are generally restricted to technical standards and capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user of the technology may also need to comply with certain requirements established by\nfederal, state, territory, local or tribal law. Our intent for finalizing a technical means for\nindividuals to request a restriction on their data is to advance tools that support privacy laws,\nincluding the HIPAA Privacy Rule right to request a restriction of certain uses and disclosures.\n\nWe note that the revision adding an internet-based method to make a request that we have\nfinalized as part of § 170.315(e)(1) only supports one component of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. As\nnoted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we emphasize that use of a Health IT Module certified to\nrevised criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) would not, by itself, fully discharge a covered entity’s\nobligations under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to allow an individual to request restriction of the use\nor disclosure of their PHI for treatment, payment, or health care operations or to have policies in\nplace to address such requests (88 FR 23826). Further, use of any such certified Health IT\nModule would not discharge the obligations of a covered entity to meet any other requirements\nunder 45 CFR 164.522. In addition, there may be other applicable laws that affect the exchange\nof particular information, and those laws should be considered when developing policies that\nprovide individuals with more granular control over the use or disclosure of their PHI.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support for a patient’s ability to manage\nvarious aspects related to their restriction requests. Multiple commenters noted that patients\nshould be able to allow data use/exchange with some parties but not others and be able to decide\nthe timing to safeguard patient autonomy and mitigate criminalization risk. Commenters also\nsuggested that the patient should be able to define when a treatment relationship exists with a\nprovider and only allow exchange with those providers who qualify, without explicit consent\nfrom the patient. One commenter noted that patients should be able to group data by type or\nencounter/procedure date or any criteria the patient wishes to impose on data use and exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother commenter recommended allowing patients to decide how long they would like to\nrestrict sensitive data from being shared. Another commenter suggested that we introduce\ncertification requirements focused on granting health care providers the option to segment entire\ndiscrete sensitive notes, which allow clinicians to limit access to notes that patients consider\nsensitive, in a fully self-contained way.\n\nWith regards to recording patient requests for restriction, we received comments related\nto the inclusion of additional, relevant information. One commenter sought clarification on\nwhether the requirement includes providing a standard way for a patient to state the purpose for a\nparticular restriction. One commenter highly recommended that we include a certification\ncriterion for the “tracking of patient privacy and disclosure requests” and another suggested that\nthe concepts “request for restriction was made” and “request for restriction was granted” be\nseparated in the requirements, recorded, and permanently associated with the related data. They\nalso recommended that if a request is denied, a rejection reason should be required, retained, and\nexchanged alongside the related data so the next recipient of the data could potentially decide\nhow to respond to the patient request.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input and advocacy on behalf of patients.\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we did not include proposals for § 170.315(e)(1) to add specific\nrequirements on the format of the “internet-based method” individuals to request restrictions. We\nalso did not specify additional functionality beyond the capability for patients (and their\nauthorized representatives) to use an internet-based method to request a restriction to be applied\nfor any data expressed in the standards in § 170.213. For example, we did not propose that the\nfunction must enable individuals to specifically identify different access roles for individual care\nteam members or that patients be enabled to group health information in different ways, such as\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby type or encounter/procedure, or that patients be provided the option to segment entire discrete\nsensitive notes. We proposed an approach that, at minimum, would support a method for patients\nto request restrictions on PHI uses and disclosures through means related to the function\nsupporting their ability to view, download, or transmit to a 3rd party their health information\nusing certified health IT. We also did not propose specific terminologies to be used for the\nrecording, disposition or notification of acceptance or denial of such requests. We appreciate the\ninsights into enhanced functionalities and the related recording of data associated with such\nrequest, but such additional requirements would constitute a significant deviation from the\nproposed functionality. We do not believe that our proposals represent sufficient notice of the\nintent to add such requirements in this final rule. However, we will continue to engage with the\nhealth IT, standards, health care provider, and patient advocacy communities and to encourage\ninnovative approaches to implementation of the adopted criteria and standards, as well as\nadvancement of additional interoperable privacy standards and functionality. We will also\nmonitor and analyze approaches by health IT developers for real world implementation of the\nrevised criterion, and will consider such information to inform further modifications in future\nrulemaking.\n\nWe further note that, while we have not finalized the inclusion of additional capabilities\nor the application of a specific standard, there are obligations imposed on covered entities under\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule, if they agree to the requested restrictions, which this functionality may\npartially support, that health IT developers may consider supporting in related capabilities. For\nexample, the HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity that agrees to a restriction request\nto use or disclose PHI in violation of such restriction except in certain limited circumstances. We\nencourage developers of certified health IT certifying Health IT Modules to the revised criterion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin § 170.315(e)(1) to consider if there are methods that additional health IT tools could integrate\nwith such Health IT Modules to facilitate these processes. In addition, while we did not propose\nand have not finalized the use of a standard for the use of security labels, we note that the HL7\nCDA DS4P IG adopted in § 170.205(o) and the HCS Security Label Vocabulary that is\nreferenced as part of the HL7 CDA DS4P IG are valuable health IT implementation resources for\nthese purposes. As described in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23824), the HCS Security\nLabel Vocabulary could serve as the basis for a format-agnostic and transport-mechanism-\nagnostic standard for the application of security labels and to define the general instructions for\nsecurity labels for a wide range of use cases including patient requested restrictions. While we\nare not requiring the use of the HCS Security Label Vocabulary within the revised criterion in\n§ 170.315(e)(1), we recommend health IT developers consider its applicability for this purpose.\n\nWe further note that the existing criteria “security tags- summary of care send and receive” in\n§ 170.315(b)(7) and (b)(8) for sending and receiving summary of care records with security\nlabels applied at the document, segment, or data element level would potentially support the\ncapabilities commenters describe, including, for example, the ability to label a clinical note in the\nC-CDA as sensitive.\n\n*Comments.* ONC also received several comments related to health equity and the need for\npatient-specific education about privacy restrictions. Multiple commenters recommended\nexplaining specific aspects of the proposed functionality to patients such as, how it facilitates\nindividual rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, how data is used to improve individual and\npopulation outcomes, and the proper role of health IT in protecting the security and privacy of\nhealth information. Multiple commenters also recommended providing counseling to patients\nregarding benefits and risks of restricting data and the impact on their healthcare outcomes and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsafety. These comments focused on empowering patients with more granular privacy controls\nwhile noting that health literacy is an important part of such control in order to avoid disparities\nin privacy protection and on overall care quality. These commenters also identified that a person\nmay not share sensitive health data if they do not understand the options for data sharing. One\ncommenter suggested that we clarify if and how patients should be informed about functionality,\nspecifically regarding the ability to request a restriction in multiple ways and with different\nlevels of granularity (rather than just having the binary choice to either share or to not share data\nglobally). Some commenters expressed concern that, if presented with complex data-element\nsharing options, patients may get confused and simply decide against sharing any data. Another\ncommenter suggested that patients also need to be informed that their requests may be denied.\n\nMultiple commenters recommended that we add a requirement that patient-facing certified\nHealth IT Modules include the capability to provide educational materials regarding the patient's\noptions about disclosure and instructions regarding how to change disclosure limitations. Other\ncommenters additionally highlighted the importance of patient education and health literacy,\nparticularly for older-adult and disabled patients who may struggle with cognitive impairments\nor behavioral health issues. Finally, commenters sought clarification on whether the patient will\nbe informed about who will be notified of restriction requests, as some may be concerned about\nnegatively impacting their relationship with their providers and/or healthcare institutions.\n\nIn addition to patients, multiple commenters suggested that we provide education and\nguidance to providers, developers, and the industry as a whole. One commenter noted that\nprovider organizations often do not have a clear mechanism for making patient restriction\nrequests or know how to process/adjudicate/implement them if they do receive requests. Another\ncommenter suggested that the industry will also need significant additional guidance and\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure. One commenter suggested that health IT developers should receive guidance\nregarding standards for developing a process for patient restriction requests. Another commenter\nnoted that without a robust communication, education, and engagement effort, many entities\nessential to implementing the final rule at medical practices, hospitals, and health systems will be\nleft out. Another commenter recommended that we consider the use of an implementation guide\nin future rulemaking, and one commenter requested that we provide full guidance on what\ndifferent types of information should be flagged and how such flags would be addressed in FHIR\nresources.\n\nSome commenters indicated ONC should provide education and work to clarify how this\nproposal is balanced with information blocking requirements. One commenter noted that\nconfusion about information blocking often results in compliance officers, administrative\npersonnel, in-house attorneys, and policy consultants misinterpreting regulations. They relayed\nfeedback that some health IT developers refuse to provide patients or physicians granular\ncontrols over medical information. The commenter noted that compliance with the information\nblocking regulation is overriding compliance with other, more protective laws and rules, and\nthey recommend that we adequately educate those involved in interpretating, implementing, and\noperationalizing our policies. Another commenter also requested that we address overlaps with\ninformation blocking, how and when to implement Notices of Privacy Practices by providers,\nand other healthcare workflow considerations that could allow this criterion to be misinterpreted\nand potentially abused. A commenter also stated that patients should be educated about\ninformation blocking and that patient facing tools should be held to similar requirements for\naccess, privacy, and security as certified health IT products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for the thoughtful consideration of the impacts of\nour proposals. As we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (see, for example, 88 FR 23748), health\nequity considerations are a driving force behind our proposals. We described the importance of\nexpanding the interoperability of health data that is essential to identifying health disparities,\nmeasuring quality, addressing gaps in care access and outcomes, providing patient-specific\npreventative care and intervention, and supporting researchers in their ability to address the risk\nof unintended bias in clinical guidelines that may exacerbate disparities (88 FR 23821). We also\ndescribed how important it is to ensure that with the expansion of exchange of granular health\nequity data comes expanded needs for thoughtful and deliberate privacy policies to support and\nprotect patients (88 FR 23821). We discussed how ONC has specifically focused on how health\nIT can support efforts to reduce healthcare disparities and provide both insights and tools for the\npurposes of measuring and advancing health equity. This includes specific steps to expand the\ncapabilities of health IT to capture and exchange data that is essential to supporting patient-\ncentered clinical care that is targeted to supporting a patient’s unique needs (88 FR 23821). We\nbelieve that patients should be empowered to make such decisions for themselves, and that\nsupport or education from clinicians might most appropriately be based on clinical impacts and\nconsiderations rather than a perceived lack of patient understanding or competency to make\ninformed decisions.\n\nWe appreciate commenters suggestion that to fully implement the range of potential\nrights afforded by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, additional guidance, infrastructure, and standards\ndevelopment is needed to process for patient restriction requests. While we agree with the need\nfor future work on technical specifications and implementation guides, we note that the behavior\nof covered entities and their role in patient education related to the HIPAA Privacy Rule or other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivacy laws is outside the scope of ONC Certification Criteria for Health IT. We encourage\ncovered entities using certified health IT to review and follow the obligations defined under the\nHIPAA Rules and other applicable laws and programs. We likewise encourage all actors who are\nrequired to comply with the HIPAA Rules, whether as HIPAA covered entities or business\nassociates, to know and to comply with all of their obligations under the HIPAA Rules. In\nresponse to the comment indicating concern for ONC to extend adequate education on\ninformation blocking, we note our deliberate focus on developing accessible, user-friendly\nresources to help inform the effective implementation of these policies. This includes, but is not\nlimited to, Frequently Asked Questions, recorded national webinars, and infographics all\naccessible on the ONC website.<sup>183</sup>\nFor discussion of the relationship of privacy laws, including\nthe HIPAA Rules and other laws, to the information blocking regulations, please see section\nIV.A of this final rule.\n\nFinally, we appreciate commenters’ suggestions about ONC’s role in educating patients\nabout health IT capabilities and standards as they relate to the privacy and security of health\ninformation. We are committed to continued public engagement for that purpose.\n\n*Comments.* We received mixed feedback on the implementation timeline proposed for\nhealth IT developers to comply with any new or revised criteria. In general, commenters (both\nthose opposed to and those supportive of the implementation timelines proposed) address the\nproposed timelines for updates to the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) within the context of the\nimplementation burden for that proposed revision and the proposed new criterion in\n§ 170.315(d)(14) together. Multiple commenters expressed concerns that the overall\n\n\nFootnote 183:\nONC Website: HealthIT.gov “Information Blocking”. https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-blocking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimplementation timeline is too aggressive. One commenter noted that if the scope of the\nproposed new and revised criteria were not narrowed and a holistic effort to also address updates\nto consent policies is not pursued, a significantly longer implementation period will be required\n(i.e., four years or longer). Commenters consistently noted that a development project for the\nrevised criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) in addition to the proposed new criterion in § 170.315(d)(14)\nwould likely require two to three years to code and test and another one to two years for\nhealthcare organizations to implement.\n\nSome commenters shared feedback regarding how to make the proposed implementation\ntimeframe more feasible. Multiple commenters suggested that if we narrow the scope to a limited\nset of USCDI v3 data elements in § 170.315(e)(1) for which restrictions can be requested and\nclearly and narrowly define the set of restrictions that certified health IT must support (e.g.,\nrestricting the specified data from being accessed by proxy users of the patient portal) in the\nproposed criterion in § 170.315(d)(14), two years from the publication of a final rule would be\nfeasible. Another commenter requested that we take an incremental approach and start with a\nlow risk, target use case for the effective date of January 1, 2026. This would allow developers\nand providers to test, learn from and build on this capability over time at both the developer and\nuser levels to address potential issues and risks.\n\nConversely, some commenters felt the timeframe would be difficult to operationalize and\nexpressed concerns regarding the implementation timeline as being too aggressive. Multiple\ncommenters noted that the proposed criterion would not be finalized until after the development\nand finalization of the USCDI v3, which ONC released July 2022, so there would not be perfect\nalignment between the use of USCDI v3 and the applicability of our proposed new and revised\ncriteria. Some commenters recommended that ONC should have a constrained scope of USCDI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to the tagging and to start with a more focused set of the most relevant data elements in\nthe USCDI thus excluding certain sensitive data from what is shareable from within the USCDI\nuntil the criterion is fully operationalized. Commenters encouraged “control” or “consent” as an\nover-arching principle to be timed along with USCDI's expansion to more person-centered\ninformation and concepts. Commenters noted this alignment is essential for EHR developers to\nhave the incentive to give users control over their preferences and for physicians be able to honor\npatients’ expressed preferences related to sensitive, life-changing, or abnormal results. In one\ninstance, a commenter also indicated that if ONC were to finalize this proposal then it should\nreconsider implementation to an earlier requirement date of January 1, 2024, to ensure that\noperationalizing patient requested restrictions is an immediate priority for software developers if\nfinalized.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input and consideration of implementation\nneeds and challenges. As previously noted, we have not finalized the proposed new criterion at §\n170.315(d)(14) nor the corresponding changes to § 170.550(h). We have only finalized the\nrevisions to the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1). We believe that the reduced scope of the changes we\nhave finalized—focusing on the revised criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) and outlining our\ncommitment to encourage the further adoption, use, and advancement in support of numerous\ncare settings and use cases of the existing criteria in § 170.315(b)(7) and (b)(8) for sending and\nreceiving health information with security labels—should help mitigate the concerns over scale,\nimplementation timeframes, and feasibility. We also believe this approach is appropriate to\nsupporting the advancement of health IT for privacy workflows that place importance on the\nneed to empower patients with agency and control of their data, while acknowledging real\nchallenges, including but not limited to scale and feasibility, as described earlier including from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthose in support of our proposals. We also agree with commenters that the revisions to the\ncriterion in § 170.315(e)(1) for use of the USCDI v3 are finalized to occur at the same time as the\nrevisions to the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) described in this section. We have finalized that these\nrevisions to the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) align with the updates made to USCDI, as discussed\nin section III.C.1 of this final rule, so that the functionality is synchronized with the USCDI v3\nincluding any new or updated data elements.\n\nWe have finalized our proposal to revise the criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) as proposed,\nwith the specific revision in § 170.315(e)(1)(iii). Pursuant to other policy decisions discussed\nelsewhere in this final rule on compliance timing, we have adopted our proposal that\nconformance with this new paragraph will be required for Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(e)(1) by January 1, 2026.\n\n\n",

              "title": "11. Requirement for Health IT Developers to Update their Previously Certified Health IT",
              "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to make explicit in the introductory text in §\n170.315 that health IT developers voluntarily participating in the Program must update their\ncertified Health IT Modules—including when new standards and capabilities are adopted—and\nprovide that updated certified health IT to customers in accordance with the timelines defined for\na specific criterion or standard where included, such as via cross-reference, in § 170.315 (88 FR\n23827). We proposed that health IT developers with health IT certified to any of the certification\ncriteria in § 170.315 would need to update their previously certified Health IT Modules to be\ncompliant with any revised certification criterion adopted in § 170.315 (please see section III.A.2\nof this final rule for discussion of the adopted definition of revised certification criterion (or\ncriteria)), including any certification criteria to which their Health IT Modules are certified that\nreference new standards adopted in 45 CFR part 170 subpart B, and capabilities included in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrevised certification criterion. Health IT developers would also need to provide the updated\nhealth IT to customers of the previously certified health IT according to the timelines established\nfor that criterion and any applicable standards (88 FR 23827).\n\nWe noted that in addition to supporting the goals of the Program, we believe this\napproach will help to advance interoperability. We stated that requiring health IT developers who\nvoluntarily participate in the Program to update Health IT Modules to revised certification\ncriteria (including new and revised standards) can help to advance capabilities for access,\nexchange, and use of EHI for authorized use under applicable State or Federal law. In addition,\nwe explained that ensuring health IT developers voluntarily participating in the Program provide\nsuch updates to customers will help to enable the secure exchange of EHI with, and use of EHI\nfrom, other health information technology without special effort on the part of the user. We also\nstated that the proposed timelines serve to support clear and transparent benchmarks for\nfurthering interoperability throughout the health IT infrastructure (88 FR 23827).\n\nWe explained that the updates to criteria may include technical capabilities such as\nsecurity enhancements or additional electronic transactions not previously supported for a\ncriterion. These updates may also include an expansion of the data supported by content,\nvocabulary, and format standards to increase the scope of interoperable EHI (88 FR 23827). The\nadoption of USCDI v3 and its incorporation into certification criteria through updates to those\ncriteria, as finalized in this rule, means that certified health IT systems will be able to support\nrepresentation of this health information in a standardized computable format. Updating current\nsystems to incorporate these data elements and providing updated certified health IT to\ncustomers would allow users of certified health IT to begin to access, exchange, and use such\ndata without special effort. Over the long term, this advancement of interoperability for certified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT systems may also have a positive impact on the availability of this essential data and\nthe capability to access, exchange, and use this data across a nationwide health IT infrastructure\n– including for purposes not yet specifically supported by certified health IT such as clinical\nresearch (88 FR 23827).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters outlined concerns regarding the definition of “provide” and,\nspecifically, the preamble language that states, “[we] propose that to ‘provide’ the product means\nthe developer must do more than make the product available and there must be demonstrable\nprogress towards implementation in real-world settings.” Commenters expressed confusion about\nwhat “demonstrable progress towards implementation in real-world settings” means and\nsuggested ONC clearly define this phrasing. Commenters also mentioned concerns about how\nthe responsibility of implementing or upgrading to health IT meeting the revised certification\nrequirements ultimately lies with the provider and not the developer.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We appreciate that the responsibility of\nimplementing a Health IT Module is not solely on the developer. With this final rule, as\ndiscussed below, we recognize the potential for variation in how implementation of certified\nhealth IT proceeds, including implementation consistent with the agreements, contracts, and\nlicenses that exist between health IT developers and their customers of certified health IT.\n\nOverall, our proposed approach is not new or exclusive to the proposed updates in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, but rather is consistent with the approach ONC adopted for the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule updates to the 2015 Edition certification criteria (85 FR 25664). From the effective\ndate of the ONC Cures Act Final Rule through December of 2022, and based on the\nprogrammatic technical assistance, developers of certified health IT successfully updated their\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntechnology and provided it to customers.<sup>184</sup>\nHowever, as discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule,\nONC used the terms “provide” and “make available” interchangeably in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule, and subsequent technical assistance (including through correspondence and via\npublic forums) was required to support clarity and achieve that transition (88 FR 23828). We\nalso noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that “provide” does not imply that the Health IT Module\nmust be in production use across all customers (88 FR 23828). Under this clarification for the\nterm “provide,” we have finalized as proposed that “provide” does not mean that the Health IT\nModule must be in production use across all customers. We encourage developers of certified\nhealth IT to provide updated Health IT Modules to their customers – and support them in their\nimplementation of such updated modules – in the manner most appropriate to support safety,\nsecurity and interoperability across settings and systems.\n\nIt is beneficial or necessary to further define “demonstrable progress toward\nimplementation in real world settings” as the phrasing or concept is not part of the finalized\nregulatory definition of “provide.” As noted by commenters, the phrasing/concept introduces\nadditional confusion over what might constitute demonstrable progress and whether\nimplementation includes production use.\n\nWe stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, and continue to maintain, that we do not intend\nfor “provide” to mean either that customers who no longer wish to use a certified Health IT\nModule must be provided the update or that customers who do choose to use an updated certified\nHealth IT Module must have the updated Health IT Module in production use by the timelines\n\n\nFootnote 184:\nSee ONC Achieving a Major Milestone: Health IT Developers Certify to Cures Update\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-it/achieving-a-major-milestone-health-it-developers-certify-to-cures-\nupdate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestablished for the health IT developer (88 FR 23828). We note that there are a number of\ninstances in which a health IT developer will have updated the Health IT Module, but the\ncustomer may have declined the update. This can occur when the customer is not yet ready to\nimplement new functionalities, standards, and/or workflows, or when the customer decides that\nthe functionalities, standards, and/or workflows are not relevant to their clinical practice.\n\nWith consideration of the above explanations, we have finalized the term “provide” with\na further clarification that “provide” is binary. That is, the updated Health IT Module is either\nprovided to customers (respective of customer choice) by the timeline established, or it is not.\n\nFurther and accordingly, we have also finalized that a health IT developer must update a Health\nIT Module as described and provide customers with updated Health IT Modules in order to\nmaintain certification of the Health IT Module. Consistent with the definition of interoperability\nand the Assurances Condition and Maintenance requirements discussed in section III.D, the\ncertified Health IT Module must be able to support all the capabilities to which it is certified, and\nsuch capabilities must be provided to the customer for use without special effort by the end of\nthe regulatory specified timelines.\n\nWe also note that we proposed to include the definition of “provide” in § 171.102, which\nstated that “Provide is defined as it is in § 170.102.” We did not intend to define “provide” in\npart 171 of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. Therefore, in this final rule, we have not finalized the\nrevision to add the definition of “provide” in § 171.102.\n\nWe have finalized in § 170.315 for all revised certification criteria and in 45 CFR part\n170 subpart B for each applicable standard, as proposed, that a Health IT Module may be\ncertified to either the existing certification criterion or the revised certification criterion until the\nend of the transition period when the prior standard(s) and/or certification criterion no longer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeet certification requirements. During this time period, existing customers may continue to use\nthe certified health IT they have available to them and can work with their developers to\nimplement updates in a manner that best meets their needs consistent with the established\nregulatory timeframes. Finally, as with the 2015 Edition Cures Update, in order to support\neffective communication of the updates, we will implement a practical approach to facilitate\ntransparency using the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL),<sup>185</sup>\nwhich is the tool that health\ncare providers and the general public may use to identify the specific certification status of a\ncertified health IT product at any given time, to explore any certification actions for a product,\nand to obtain a CMS Certification ID for a product, which is used when participating in some\nCMS programs.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters voiced concerns about how the HTI-1 Proposed Rule aligns with\nCMS’s Promoting Interoperability Program — specifically, the impact on the timing of when\nhospitals and clinicians implement or upgrade an EHR in order to comply with CMS regulations.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We have worked closely with CMS\nfor more than a decade to ensure alignment between our Program and CMS programs, including\nthe Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the Quality Payment Program (these\nprograms incorporate the programs previously known as the EHR Incentive Payment Programs,\nor “Meaningful Use”) and we will continue to do so moving forward. For example, CMS\nfinalized in the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84815 through 84828) that health care providers\nparticipating in the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and eligible clinicians\nparticipating in the Quality Payment Program must use certified health IT that satisfies the\n\n\nFootnote 185:\nONC Certified Health IT Product List: https://chpl.healthit.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefinitions of CEHRT at 42 CFR 495.4 and 414.1305, respectively, and is certified under the\nProgram, in accordance with the 2015 Edition Cures Update, as finalized in the ONC 21st\nCentury Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642).\n\nAs part of the CY 2024 PFS Final Rule, CMS finalized revisions to the definitions of\nCEHRT in §§ 495.4 and 414.1305 for the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and for\nthe Quality Payment Program (88 FR 78308 through 79312) in a manner consistent with the\n“edition-less” approach to health IT certification that we proposed in the ONC HTI-1 Proposed\nRule. This included removing references to the “2015 Edition” in the CEHRT definition, and that\nin order to meet the CEHRT definitions, technology must meet ONC's certification criteria in 45\nCFR 170.315 “as adopted and updated by ONC.” CMS stated that these revisions would ensure\nthat updates to the 2015 Base EHR or subsequent Base EHR definition at § 170.102, and updates\nto applicable health IT certification criteria in § 170.315, would be incorporated into CEHRT\ndefinitions, without requiring additional regulatory action by CMS. CMS noted in its final rule\nthat it will continue to determine when new or revised versions of measures that require the use\nof certified health IT would be required for participation under the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program and the Quality Payment Program. In determining requirements for any\npotential new or revised measures, CMS stated it will consider factors such as implementation\ntimelines and provider readiness to inform when CMS proposes requiring participants to\ncomplete measures that rely on the use of certified health IT (88 FR 79310). We will continue to\nwork with CMS as we finalize timeline requirements for developers of certified health IT to\nupdate and provide certified health IT to their customers so that their customers (e.g., health care\nproviders) can meet CMS requirements for the use of such certified health IT. We also note that,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhistorically, CMS has included additional guidance for program participants within CMS\nproposed or final rules (see, for example, 85 FR 84818–84828).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters in general agreed that if a Health IT Module is not updated to\nnew or revised certification criteria, then the Health IT Module should be retired at the\n“expiration date” of the certification criterion and/or standard. One commenter expressed\nconfusion about using the term “shall update” when it is up to the developer to determine if they\nwant to update their health IT to comply with new or revised certification criteria.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. Participation in the Program is voluntary\nand, therefore, any “shall” statements within the Program only apply to a health IT developer\nthat is participating and plans to continue to participate in the Program. If a developer\nparticipating in the Program intends to no longer support a specific certified Health IT Module,\nbut intends to continue to participate in the Program, previously finalized policies relating to the\nwithdrawal of a Health IT Module or modification of a certificate would remain applicable (88\nFR 23828). Otherwise, if a health IT developer participates in the Program and intends to\nmaintain certification of a Health IT Module, the developer will need to comply with the\nrequirements of the Program, including the finalized requirement in the introductory text to §\n170.315 stating “[f]or all criteria in this section, a health IT developer with a Health IT Module\ncertified to any revised certification criterion, as defined in § 170.102, shall update the Health IT\nModule and shall provide such update to their customers in accordance with the dates identified\nfor each revised certification criterion and for each applicable standard in 45 CFR part 170\nsubpart B.”\n\n\n",

To support this assurance, we\nproposed accompanying Maintenance of Certification requirements, which are discussed below.\n\nThe Maintenance of Certification requirements define the scope of this Condition of Certification\nand provide clarity in terms of what it would mean to take the action of “inhibiting,” what\nconstitutes “timely access,” and what is “interoperable health IT certified under the Program” (88\nFR 23829).\n\n*Comments.* In general, commenters supported the establishment of a new Condition of\nCertification and the accompanying Maintenance of Certification requirements. Commenters\nidentified multiple benefits of the proposed requirements such as ensuring timely access to\ninteroperable health IT and promoting the adoption of advanced technologies and capabilities\nthat can enhance patient care and workflow efficiency. One commenter noted how these\nrequirements will positively impact the community of health centers by ensuring they have\naccess to the latest capabilities and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. As noted above and discussed in\ndetail in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23826), these new requirements will serve to provide\nthe assurances to the Secretary that Congress sought and further clarify Program requirements.\n\nInteroperable health IT is an underpinning of the Program and particularly the conditions of\ncertification found in the Cures Act and implemented in 45 CFR part 170 subpart D. Congress\nestablished support for health IT interoperability beginning with the authority provided in section\n3001(c)(5) of the HITECH Act to adopt standards (including implementation specifications and\ncertification criteria) and establish the Program.\n\nFor purposes of certification and the maintenance of such certification under the\nProgram, a health IT developer will need to provide an assurance that its health IT is certified to\nthe most recently adopted certification criteria and such certified health IT is made available to\nits customers in a timely manner. These actions are essential because certification criteria, and in\nparticular revised certification criteria (as defined in this final rule), include standards,\nimplementation specifications, and capabilities that support and improve interoperability as that\nterm is defined by the Cures Act and incorporated in 45 CFR part 170. Since the inception of the\nProgram, ONC has updated certification criteria to include the most recent versions of standards\nand implementation specifications that most appropriately support and improve interoperability\nat the time of adoption. We do this because as standards and implementation specifications\nevolve, they, by their very nature, improve interoperability by allowing for more complete\naccess, exchange, and use of all electronically accessible health information. Further, the\ninteroperability definition also focuses, in part, on the secure exchange and use of EHI from\nother health IT without special effort on the part of the user. The Assurances Condition of\nCertification is an important piece to supporting and achieving these goals because it seeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassurances from health IT developers that they will not take any actions to inhibit the appropriate\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI. We, therefore, have finalized in § 170.402(a)(5), as proposed\nthat, as a Condition of Certification, a health IT developer must provide an assurance that it will\nnot inhibit a customer’s timely access to interoperable health IT certified under the Program.\n\n*Comments.* A handful of commenters expressed concern about how the Maintenance of\nCertification requirements may be interpreted as mandatory when the decision to participate in\nthe Program is voluntary. One commenter identified the use of the term “shall update” as\npossibly being misunderstood as an obligation for developers to continue to participate in the\nProgram when, in fact, it is up to the developer to determine if they want to pursue certification\nor to allow the module to be retired.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input. Participation in the Program is\nvoluntary. Health IT developers do not have an obligation to continue to participate in the\nProgram. However, as discussed under section III.C.11 “Requirement for Health IT Developers\nto Update their Previously Certified Health IT,” if a health IT developer does participate in the\nProgram, it needs to comply with the requirements of the Program, including the finalized\nAssurances Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* Two commenters identified difficulties in navigating between the different\nrequirements for certified health IT for ONC and CMS. Both commenters recommended CMS\ndelay the effective date of changes to the definition of CEHRT referenced within CMS programs\nuntil the next reporting period or performance year. The commenters stated that this proposed\nmodification would eliminate confusion and promote cross-agency collaboration.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. We recognize that certain CMS\nprograms, including the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and the Quality Payment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram, require the use of technology meeting the CEHRT definitions in 42 CFR 495.4 and 42\nCFR 414.1305. The CEHRT definitions cross-reference health IT certification criteria in 45 CFR\n170.315, including relevant dates within the certification criteria which define the requirements\nof the certification criterion.\n\nWhile changes to the definition of CEHRT maintained by CMS are outside the scope of\nthis final rule, we note that, as part of the CY 2024 PFS Final Rule, CMS finalized revisions to\nthe definitions of CEHRT in 42 CFR 495.4 and 414.1305 for the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program and for the Quality Payment Program (88 FR 78308 through 79312),\nincluding specifying that in order to meet the CEHRT definitions, technology must meet the\n2015 Base EHR or subsequent Base EHR definition (as defined at 45 CFR 170.102) and other\ncertification criteria in 45 CFR 170.315 “as adopted and updated by ONC.” CMS stated that\nthese revisions would ensure that updates to the 2015 Base EHR or subsequent Base EHR\ndefinition at § 170.102, and updates to applicable health IT certification criteria in § 170.315,\nwould be incorporated into the CEHRT definitions, without requiring additional regulatory\naction by CMS. We also note that CMS stated that it did not agree with separate effective dates\nin the CEHRT definitions for the use of updated certified health IT products within the Medicare\nPromoting Interoperability Program or the Quality Payment Program, as recommended by\ncommenters (88 FR 79311). CMS stated that emphasizing the timelines ONC adopts through\nnotice and comment rulemaking for health IT developers to update and provide certified\ntechnology to their customers will reduce burden on participants in the Medicare Promoting\nInteroperability Program and the Quality Payment Program. CMS further stated that it will\ncontinue to determine when new or revised versions of measures that require the use of certified\nhealth IT would be required for participation under the Medicare Promoting Interoperability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram and the Quality Payment Program and will consider factors such as implementation\ntime and provider readiness to determine when to require reporting on these measures. We agree\nwith CMS’ statements on these topics.\n\nIn order to support effective communication of the updates, we intend to implement a\npractical approach to supporting CMS program participants and other certified health IT users\nthrough the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) in the same manner as was implemented for\nthe 2015 Edition Cures Update. As also discussed under section III.C.11 “Requirement for\nHealth IT Developers to Update their Previously Certified Health IT,” the CHPL is the tool that\nhealth care providers and the general public may use to identify the specific certification status of\na certified health IT product at any given time, to explore any certification actions for a product,\nand to obtain a CMS Certification ID for a product, which is used when participating in some\nCMS programs. We note that historically, CMS has included additional guidance for such\nprogram participants within CMS proposed or final rules (see, for example, 85 FR 84818–\n84828).\n\n\n",

However, we proposed deviations to this\ntimeframe because the “provide” requirement applies to all Health IT Modules that are certified\nto a criterion that meets the revised certification criterion definition (i.e., not just health IT\npreviously certified to a ‘prior version’ of a revised certification criterion) and to new customers\nof health IT certified to revised certification criteria (88 FR 23829 through 23830).\n\nIn all the above circumstances, we proposed that health IT certified to revised\ncertification criteria must be provided to all customers, including new customers (i.e., new to the\ncapabilities), of health IT developers under the Program within reasonable timeframes (88 FR\n23830).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Multiple commenters supported the Assurances Condition and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements. One commenter suggested health IT developers be required to\nprovide all current and new customers with the most current version of a certified Health IT\nModule. Additionally, the commenter recommended that all health IT developers who have\nchosen not to comply with new or revised certification standards send a communication to\ncustomers in order to better inform such customers.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. We have finalized in §\n170.402(b)(3)(i), as proposed, that a health IT developer must update a Health IT Module, once\ncertified to a certification criterion adopted in § 170.315, to all applicable revised certification\ncriteria, including the most recently adopted capabilities and standards included in the revised\ncertification criterion. For clarity, ‘applicable revised certification criteria’ includes those\ncertification criteria to which the Health IT Module was previously certified that meet the\ndefinition of a revised certification criterion as finalized in this rule (please see section III.A.2 of\nthe preamble, including Table 1, and “revised certification criterion (or criteria)” under §\n170.102 of the regulation text for the definition of revised certification criterion (or criteria)).\n\nEqually important, and, as stated above, to meet the requirement, the Health IT Module will need\nto be updated to the most recently adopted capabilities and standards included in the revised\ncertification criterion. Second, we have finalized, in § 170.402(b)(3)(ii), that a health IT\ndeveloper must provide all Health IT Modules certified to a revised certification criterion to its\ncustomers of such certified health IT. As noted above, a customer, for this purpose, is any\nindividual or entity that has an agreement to purchase or license the developer’s certified health\nIT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the comment about sending a communication to customers by a health IT\ndeveloper not complying with the “update and provide” requirements, we note that the developer\nwould, under the commenter’s described circumstances, violate these new Maintenance of\nCertification requirements and the Condition of Certification we have finalized at §\n170.402(a)(5), by inhibiting a customer’s timely access to interoperable health IT certified under\nthe Program. As such, the developer will have committed non-conformities under the Program,\nunless the health IT developer did so for a permissible reason as described in section III.C.11 (for\nexample, a developer of certified health IT would not be required to provide updated certified\nhealth IT to any customer that elected to decline the update for any reason; or a health IT\ndeveloper’s exercising its ability to reduce the scope of a certification while not under ONC-\nACB surveillance or ONC direct review). Because we did not propose a requirement that health\nIT developers who have chosen not to comply with new or revised certification standards send a\ncommunication to customers in order to better inform providers and hospitals, we have not\naccepted this recommendation. However, if the developer committed a non-conformity, the\nProgram process for correcting the non-conformity may involve notification to all customers.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested additional information regarding when, as proposed, a\nregulatory exception (“unless expressly stated otherwise in 45 CFR part 170”) to the 24-month\ncriteria might be applied by ONC in § 170.402(b)(3)(iii)(A). Commenters outlined how a\npossible exception creates additional timelines in an environment where competing priorities\nbetween meeting deadlines associated with ONC requirements and the requirements under CMS\nregulations already exist. A few commenters requested ONC provided explicit guidelines about\nwhen a regulatory exception to the “24 months plus X” requirement might be applied. One\ncommenter expressed concern about how this proposed regulatory exception may negatively\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimpact development roadmaps and the ability to fulfill requests falling outside of non-regulatory\nfunctionality. Further, multiple commenters expressed concerns about the proposed deadlines\nand the implications these timeframes have on developers and providers. Commenters stressed\nthe importance of having 18-24 months to address any new or revised certification requirements\nand identified the December 31st date outlined in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule as a specific concern.\n\nOne commenter specifically stated “[g]iven requirements on the implementation end of the\ncycle, vendors must have 24 months prior to general availability to properly develop and certify\ntheir solutions.”\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback. For purposes of regulatory clarity, we\nhave revised the proposed “timeliness” provision in § 170.402(b)(3)(iii)(A). We have modified\nthe proposed timeliness requirement to state, “a health IT developer must complete the “update”\nand “provide” requirements consistent with the timeframes specified in part 170”\n\n(§ 170.402(b)(3)(iii)(A)). This means that the compliance dates included in the certification\ncriteria in § 170.315 and standards in subpart B will establish when health IT developers need to\ncomply with these Maintenance of Certification requirements. In § 170.402(b)(3)(iii)(B), we\nhave finalized the provision that health IT developers will still have up to 12 months, at a\nminimum, to provide new customers with health IT certified to revised criteria. Specifically, we\nhave finalized that for health IT developers that obtain new customers after the effective date of a\nfinal rule, the health IT developer must provide health IT certified to revised certification criteria\neither in the timeframe identified in part 170 or not later than 12 months after the purchasing or\nlicensing relationship has been established between the health IT developer and the new\ncustomer for the health IT certified to the revised criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe timeframe, as noted above, will offer health IT developers no less than 12 months to\nprovide health IT certified to revised certification criteria to new customers (i.e., customers new\nto the capability). Based on the timeframe, a health IT developer has the ability to plan both the\ncertification to revised certification criteria and the execution of contracts and agreements with\nnew customers to ensure that it can meet the above timeline for new customers. To note, we have\nalso finalized a conforming revision to the Real World Testing Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements in § 170.405(b), as proposed at 88 FR 23830, in that we removed most of the\n“update and provide” requirements currently found in § 170.405(b)(3) through (7) and (b)(10)\nbecause they will be moot based on the effective date of this final rule (e.g., many timelines\nexpired on December 31, 2022). Therefore, in § 170.405, we removed and reserved paragraphs\n(b)(3) through (7) and (b)(10).\n\n\n",

          "text": "In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized requirements in § 170.405(a) that a health\nIT developer with Health IT Module(s) certified to § 170.315(b), (c)(1) through (3), (e)(1), (f),\n(g)(7) through (10), and (h) must: successfully test the real world use of the technology for\ninteroperability in the type(s) of setting(s) in which such technology would be marketed. We\nestablished in § 170.405(b) that each developer’s annual real world testing plan is required to be\npublished by December 15 of a given year and would need to address all of the developer’s\nHealth IT Modules certified to criteria listed in § 170.405(a) as of August 31 of that year (85 FR\n25769). We also finalized that the annual real world testing plan would pertain to real world\ntesting activities to be conducted in the year following the December 15 plan publication due\ndate, with an annual real world testing results report to be published by March 15 (§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.405(b)(2)(ii) of the year following the year in which the real world testing is conducted) (85\nFR 25774).\n\nMany health IT developers, however, update their Health IT Module(s) on a regular\nbasis, leveraging the flexibility provided through the Program’s Inherited Certified Status (ICS)\noption.<sup>186</sup>\nBecause of the way that ONC issues certification identifiers, this updating can cause an\nexisting certified Health IT Module to be recognized as new within the Program. All updates to\ncertified health IT must be tracked and recorded to support program integrity and transparency\nwithin the Program. When a certified health IT developer leverages ICS for Health IT Modules\nthat have been updated, they receive a new certification date for the newer version of the\ncertified Health IT Module. When an ICS certification is issued, a new certification date is issued\nby the ONC-ACB to reflect these updates. Regular updating, especially on a frequent basis such\nas quarterly or semi-annually, creates an anomaly that could result in existing certified Health IT\nModules being inadvertently excluded from the real world testing reporting requirements\nbecause of those updates.\n\nIn order to ensure that all developers test the real world use of their certified health IT, as\nrequired, we proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to eliminate this anomaly by requiring health\nIT developers to include in their real world testing results report the most recent version of those\ncertified Health IT Module(s) that are updated using Inherited Certified Status after August 31 of\nthe year in which the plan is submitted (88 FR 23831). This approach would ensure that health\nIT developers fully test all applicable Health IT Modules as part of their real world testing\nrequirements. This policy would also prevent a developer from avoiding, or delaying conducting\n\n\nFootnote 186:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/policy/public_applicability_of_gap_certification_and_inherited_certifi\ned_status.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor reporting, real world testing specifically on the updated versions of Health IT Modules\ncertified through Inherited Certified Status after August 31 of a given year. This policy would\nnot change the underlying requirement that a developer with one or more Health IT Modules\ncertified to any criterion listed in § 170.405(a) must plan, conduct, and report on real world\ntesting of each of those Health IT Modules on an annual basis.\n\n*Comments.* A significant number of commenters supported our proposal to require\ndevelopers of certified health IT to include in their real world testing results report newer\nversions of those certified Health IT Module(s) that are updated using Inherited Certified Status\nafter August 31 of the year in which the plan is submitted. Many commenters reiterated the\nimportance of real world testing and expressed appreciation for ONC’s efforts to address the\nanomaly that could result in existing certified Health IT Modules being inadvertently excluded\nfrom the real world testing reporting requirements when updated using Inherited Certified Status\nbefore their real world testing results reports are due. Several commenters praised the\nrequirement to demonstrate conformity in a production environment and the assurance gained\nfrom testing results that reflect the most recent version of the certified health IT used to meet real\nworld testing requirements A commenter in support of this proposal suggested that ONC make\nreal world testing mandatory for all health IT developers. Overall, commenters in support of this\nproposal recognize real world testing as a critical component to verifying certified health IT,\neligible for real world testing, works in real world scenarios and use cases, and appreciate ONC’s\nefforts to advance real world testing requirements by requiring health IT updated using Inherited\nCertified Status to be included in health IT developers’ real world testing results reports. One\ncommenter requested that ONC clarify in rulemaking which versions of the certified Health IT\nModule, after updating using ICS, are required to be included in real world testing results report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and agree with the need to ensure newer\nversions of certified Health IT Modules updated after the August 31 deadline using Inherited\nCertified Status are accounted for in real world testing and results reporting. We have issued\npublic resources that provide clarity on what versions of certified health IT should be included in\nreal world testing results reports and believe that the guidance is sufficient for developers to\ndetermine, for their unique circumstances, which versions of their certified health IT should be\nincluded in their results reports.<sup>187</sup>\nCurrently, certification criteria identified in § 170.405(a) are\nrequired to adhere to the Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements, and this final rule does not change the applicable criteria (§ 170.315(b), (c)(1)\nthrough (3), (e)(1), (f), (g)(7) through (10), and (h)).<sup>188</sup>\nONC will continue to collaborate with\ninterested parties to ensure all required certified health IT continues to function in real-world\nscenarios and workflows as intended by certification requirements for interoperability and data\nexchange. We have finalized our requirements at § 170.405(b)(2)(ii) for health IT developers to\ninclude in their real world testing results report the newer version of those certified Health IT\nModule(s) that are updated using Inherited Certified Status after August 31 of the year in which\nthe plan is submitted.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter was not supportive of this proposal and the requirement for\nhealth IT developers to conduct real world testing on their certified health IT and expressed\nconcerns that it adds no value to health IT certification. This commenter suggested that if\n\n\nFootnote 187:\nSee Real World Testing Resource Guide and other resources at: https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-\nehrs/real-world-testing\n\n\nFootnote 188:\nPlease see the Real World Testing Fact Sheet, page 3, for a list of certification criteria at:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-02/Real-World-Testing-Fact-Sheet.pdf#page=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\navailable functionality is not being implemented in production environments it should not be\nrequired for real world testing.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose any substantive changes or updates to the real world\ntesting requirements in § 170.405. Congress required the real world testing of certified health IT\nfor interoperability in the Cures Act (PHSA § 3001(c)(5)(D)(v)). We have implemented this\nrequirement through the Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. The real world testing of certified health IT has value to the Program and users of\ncertified health IT. Since December 2022, more than 500 real world testing plans and results\nhave been submitted by developers of certified health IT with applicable certification criteria.\n\nThe plans and reports have provided insight into how developers of certified health IT think\nabout framing and measuring the interoperability of their certified Health IT Modules in\nproduction use. The plans and reports also provide interested parties with information they can\nuse to understand how a specific certified Health IT Module is demonstrating real world\ninteroperability.<sup>189</sup>\nWe are aware of the challenges faced by health IT developers when\nestablishing approaches to meet their real world testing requirements. ONC has released several\npublic resources to assist the developer community in developing real world testing plans and\nnavigating unique circumstances such as low adoption of specific certified health IT\ncapabilities.<sup>190</sup>\nAmong numerous points of guidance, the Real World Testing Resource Guide\nincludes information on how developers of certified health IT should treat Health IT Modules\nthat do not have functionality or that have not yet implemented functionality in production\n\n\nFootnote 189:\nhttps://chpl.healthit.gov/#/collections/real-world-testing\n\n\nFootnote 190:\nSee Real World Testing Resource Guide and other resources at: https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-\nehrs/real-world-testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenvironments. We also reiterate that the Aug 31 deadline for eligible certified health IT supports\ndeveloper preparation activities well before entering the applicable calendar year of real world\ntesting.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters raised concerns that are out of scope for the proposal,\nincluding suggestions for additional certification and real world testing requirements to improve\ninteroperability, none of which are addressed in this rulemaking. Some made recommendations\nfor how ONC may enhance certification and real world testing requirements by further defining\nmeasures, data elements, and how health IT should be assessed for data augmentation solutions.\n\nA number of these commenters expressed the need for additional real world testing requirements,\nsuch as more rigorous testing of data segmentation, standards and implementation guides, and\nrequired standard code sets. Some commenters requested more focus on public health data and\nthe use of standard code sets to improve data quality for real world testing, stating that clinical\nand laboratory partners require data inputs that are high quality, correctly coded, and not reliant\non human readability or narrative text to provide critical information. Commenters asserted that\nthese additions to real world testing requirements would diminish mapping burden, improve data\nentry, facilitate improvements to data quality, and lessen administrative burden on clinical staff.\n\nOne commenter requested that ONC require real world testing of certified health IT before the\nsale and implementation of the certified health IT in clinical settings. Another commenter\nrequested that ONC not consider standards mature until they have been real world tested with\npublicly available comprehensive testing reports. Lastly, one commenter raised issues related to\nhuman research protocols when conducting real world testing using real patient data and the need\nto protect this data from misuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the input. Because these recommendations for\ncertification and real world testing requirements are out of scope for the HTI-1 Proposed Rule in\nthat we did not propose to change any related real world testing conformance requirements, we\ndecline to finalize any such changes. ONC previously finalized requirements, through the ONC\nCures Act Final Rule, for real world testing plans and results reports, the required elements to be\nincluded, and developers’ responsibilities for establishing measure(s) for their approach to\nassessing their health IT in real world settings (see 85 FR 3580). We reiterate that the proposal\nfinalized in this final rule specifically addresses health IT developers who update their certified\nHealth IT Modules using Inherited Certified Status after the August 31 deadline and before\nresults reports are due for a particular year of real world testing. We also note that the Inherited\nCertified Status flexibility is specifically designed for updates to certified Health IT Modules that\ndo not adversely impact certified capabilities.\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23831), we stated that the proposed measures\nassociated with the Insights Condition related to and reflected the interoperability category in\nsection 3009A(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the PHSA. We further stated that these measures related to four\naspects or areas of interoperability, which we referred to as measurement “areas:” individuals'\naccess to EHI, public health information exchange, clinical care information exchange, and\nstandards adoption and conformance, as discussed in further detail below (88 FR 23831). We\nexplained that the majority of our proposed measures were data points derived from certified\nhealth IT. The measures generally consisted of numerators and denominators that would help\ngenerate metrics (e.g., percent across a population), which were further detailed in each measure,\nbut the measures could also serve as standalone values. We noted that in some cases we planned\nto generate multiple metrics by using different denominators for the same numerator or using\ndifferent numerators with the same denominator. For each proposed measure, we included\ninformation on the rationale for the proposed measure, proposed numerators and denominators,\nand key topics for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to modify measures developed by the\nUrban Institute to reduce ambiguities and to address potential costs and burdens. Based upon\npublic comment and interested party input consistent with section 3009A(a)(3)(C) and (D) of the\nPHSA, we proposed to modify the measures the Urban Institute developed, as well as the\nproposed minimum reporting qualifications, to ensure that small and startup developers are not\nunduly disadvantaged by the measures.<sup>191</sup>\nWe also stated that in future rulemaking we anticipated proposing additional measures for\nfuture iterations of the Insights Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements under\nthe Program and that through this first set of measures we intended to provide insights on the\ninteroperability category specified in the Cures Act (as codified at section 3009A(a)(3)(A)(iii) of\nthe PHSA). We also stated that we intended to explore the other Cures Act categories (security,\nusability and user-centered design, conformance to certification testing, and other categories to\nmeasure the performance of EHR technology) in future requirements (88 FR 23832).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832), we stated that we explored various pathways\non how to make it easier for the public to view and comment on the detailed technical\nspecifications supporting the measures. We directed readers to consult our website healthIT.gov\nand provide comment on the technical specifications for measure calculation. We received\nnumerous comments regarding the information described in the technical specifications for the\nmeasures, including the definitions of various measurement-related terms such as encounters and\nduplicate C-CDAs. We have included summaries of these comments within their respective\nmeasure sections in this final rule. While the substantive requirements for each measure are\n\n\nFootnote 191:\nUrban Institute. See https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/health-policy-center/projects/ehr-reporting-program\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefined in this final rule, we determined that measure specification sheets are a logical and\naccessible method for the public to also view the technical specifications that support those\nrequirements. The finalized specification sheets accompanying this final rule are available at\nwww.healthit.gov/hti-1. This is consistent with the approach used by other HHS programs\nrelated to measure technical specifications (e.g., CMS Electronic Clinical Quality Measures\n(CMS eCQMs)).192,<sup>193</sup>\nThis approach of publishing technical specification separately allows for\nmore effective viewing of the technical details, including supporting public comment on those\nspecifications in a transparent manner. We welcomed comments on the measure specifications\nsheets accompanying the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR\n23832) that such public comment will be used to further refine the technical specifications. We\nalso stated that we intended to keep these measure specification sheets up to date. We also note\nthat if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a revision\nto a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification would also be\nchanged to ensure alignment with the revised criterion.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters, including health care provider specialty organizations,\ntechnology advocates, health information exchanges, healthcare quality organizations, and some\nhealth IT developers, were generally supportive of our proposals to implement the new Insights\nCondition, and of the measures and reporting processes described. A few commenters\nemphasized the potential of information gleaned from the Insights Condition to drive\ntransparency in the health IT marketplace and, in particular, to highlight ways for patients to\naccess and use their data. One commenter noted that ONC’s development of the Insights\n\n\nFootnote 192:\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/\n\n\nFootnote 193:\nhttps://mmshub.cms.gov/get-involved/public-comments/overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition demonstrates commitment to improving interoperability, and encouraged ONC to\nenvision a future state of health information exchange capabilities that include patient-requested\nrestrictions, outcomes tracking, and integration of data from other sources such as Prescription\nDrug Monitoring Programs. Commenters also lauded the potential of the Insights Condition to\nclarify trends in current capabilities for interoperability services such as APIs that will allow the\nmarket to address gaps and improve interoperability. One commenter noted that they believe\npublic health programs and safety net providers could particularly benefit from the Insights\nCondition and encouraged ONC to work with community health centers to ensure that its\nimplementation supports the populations they serve.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback and appreciate their support for the\npotential of the Insights Condition to address information gaps in the marketplace and improve\ninteroperability. We also appreciate comments taking note of our efforts to improve\ninteroperability and continue to explore avenues to increase efficient information exchange for\nuse in improving health and healthcare. As stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23831),\ndata collected and reported under the Insights Condition will address information gaps in the\nhealth IT marketplace and provide insights on the use of certified health IT. We also agree that\npublic health and safety net providers can benefit from increased market transparency that the\nInsights Condition can provide. We will continue to engage with public health professionals and\nsafety net providers in our implementation of the Program.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested that information gained from the Insights\nCondition will not benefit current users of certified health IT, and some commenters questioned\nthe value of the data in furthering interoperability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We fundamentally disagree with this perspective offered by some commenters.\n\nIn the Cures Act, Congress established the requirement to create an EHR Reporting Program and\nwe believe that submission of specific measures pursuant to the Insights Condition under the\nProgram will provide transparent reporting, address information gaps in the health IT\nmarketplace, and provide insights on the use of certified health IT. The adopted metrics are\nspecifically meant to provide insights on how certified health IT enables various aspects of\ninteroperability, including individuals' access to EHI, public health information exchange,\nclinical care information exchange, and standards adoption and conformance. These metrics help\naddress gaps in information in the health IT marketplace by providing data on key aspects of\ninteroperability that are neither directly nor publicly available from other sources. As described\nin greater detail within this final rule, the metrics will be shared with the public in a transparent\nmanner on ONC’s website.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters expressed support and understanding of the use of\nnumerators and denominators by ONC. One professional society expressed support of all\nproposed measures and numerator/denominator combinations. One commenter specifically\nvoiced support for all the various numerator/denominator combinations proposed as a key\nopportunity to provide market transparency on various aspects of how information is being\nexchanged and used by patients and health care providers, and another commenter specifically\nsupported requiring health IT developers to report on the measures. Further, the commenter\nhighlighted the potential of the various combinations to help ONC provide market transparency\non various aspects of how information is being exchanged and used by patients and health care\nproviders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a number of commenters expressed confusion related to the terms\nnumerator and denominator. One commenter requested ONC establish more succinct separation\nand definition of numerators and denominators for the Insights Condition. Further, the\ncommenter stated measure definitions for numerators and denominators are confusing and\noverlap. Another commenter found the terms numerator and denominator confusing and\nrequested that ONC use different ones. One commenter encouraged ONC to maximize reuse of\ncollected data, such as allowing a given measure to be submitted once and tagged to count for all\nrelevant metrics where it can be reused. One commenter suggested that ONC state in the\noverview section for the Insights Condition that developers will be required to submit raw data,\nand metrics will be calculated after submission. Another commenter suggested removing\nexpected metrics from the specification sheets and only focusing on counts or metrics to be\ncollected by health IT developers.\n\n*Response.* To reduce confusion, we have replaced the terms “numerator” and\n“denominator” with “metric” throughout the Insights Condition. Numerator and denominator\nwere terms meant to identify how the metrics would be used to generate various statistics, but\ngiven the confusion expressed through public comments related to these terms, we have\nsimplified and replaced these terms. Thus, instead of a list of numerators and denominators that\nwould be submitted, health IT developers shall be responsible for submitting a list of metrics.\n\nThis applies across all the finalized measures. This represents a change in terminology and does\nnot represent a substantive change. Developers of certified health IT are responsible for reporting\non the metrics, not calculating the derived statistics. We would like to reiterate that ONC will be\nresponsible for calculating any derived statistics from the reported metrics using various\ncombinations of the metrics (previously known as numerators and denominators). In other\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwords, this final rule focuses on listing the metrics that developers of certified health IT would\nbe collecting and reporting, rather than the derived statistics which ONC will calculate.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters requested clarification on the information that would be\nrequired for submission by health IT developers. One commenter requested ONC establish\ndetailed, clear, and consistent specifications for reporting and attestation under the Insights\nCondition.\n\n*Response.* As stated earlier in this preamble and in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR\n23832), we explored various pathways on how to make it easier for the public to view the\ndetailed technical specifications supporting the measures. We determined that measure\nspecification sheets were a logical and accessible method for the public to view the technical\nspecifications supporting those requirements in a clear and consistent manner and that measure\nspecification sheets have been used successfully by other agencies such as CMS for detailing\ntheir measures. The information in this preamble and in the measure specification sheets\nprovides the list of metrics and specifications for reporting and attestation under the Insights\nCondition. We intend to provide up to date measure specification sheets to assist with the\ncommunity’s understanding of the finalized measures and metric calculations. The measure\nspecifications provide granular definitions and other information needed to operationalize the\nmetrics to ensure they are implemented in a consistent manner across health IT developers. The\nupdated measure specification sheets that reflect the final set of metrics will be available for\ndownload and viewing on ONC’s website at www.healthit.gov/hti-1. We believe that the\nmeasure specification sheets provide a more user-friendly format that is more easily accessible.\n\nFor example, given that not all metrics may be applicable to all health IT developers, developers\ncan select which metrics they wish to review and download. We also intend to publish\n\n\n\n\n\n\neducational materials on ONC’s website that include graphics and other visual displays to help\nexplain the metrics and the reporting process.\n\nMeasurement Area: Individual Access to Electronic Health Information\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed in § 170.407(a)(1) a measure within the\nindividuals’ access to their EHI measurement area to require that any developer of certified\nhealth IT with Health IT Modules certified to the criteria specified in the measure to report on\nthe different methods individuals use to access their health information. We refer readers to the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23833) for detailed background associated with the “individuals’\naccess to electronic health information supported by certified API technology” measure.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters expressed support for the proposed measure noting the\nimportance of patients’ engagement in their own healthcare and the need to further understand\nhow individuals access their health data. Most commenters indicated support of the general\nintent and focal points of the proposed measure, while including recommendations to simplify\nthe measure. Some commenters indicated this measure would pose a high level of burden,\nparticularly related to encounter-based metrics. Another commenter stated the proposed measure\nshould not present a significant regulatory burden as the data can be collected in real-time using\nestablished technologies.\n\n*Response.* We have made revisions in response to public comment in an effort to reduce\nburden and simplify reporting as further described below. We note for readers that we have\nrevised some of the measure names (including the name of this measure, which we updated to\nindividuals’ access to electronic health information through certified health IT) for additional\nclarity and consistency. The revisions to the measure names do not inherently reflect substantive\nchanges to the measure. We have used the phrase “certified health IT” across our measures to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovide clarity and consistency across the Program. We thank commenters for expressing\nsupport for the proposed measure and agree that it will contribute valuable insight into the\nmethods that individuals use to obtain access to their EHI. This information can help ONC and\nothers build an understanding of where EHI is available for usage so that individuals can make\ninformed decisions about their healthcare.\n\nIndividuals’ Access to Electronic Health Information Through Certified Health IT\nMeasure\nWe proposed (88 FR 23833) to adopt the “individuals’ access to electronic health\ninformation supported by certified API technology” measure within the “individuals’ access to\nelectronic health information” area in § 170.407(a)(1). We proposed (88 FR 23833 and 23834) to\nrequire that any developer of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to either the\n“view, download, and transmit to a 3rd party” certification criterion (§ 170.315(e)(1)), or the\n“standardized API for patient and population services” certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)),\nreport the numbers of unique patients that used each of the specified methods to access their\nEHI.\n\nWe proposed two distinct numerators and three denominators as part of the measure (88\nFR 23834) in § 170.407(a)(1) and noted that we planned to generate multiple metrics from a\ncombination of different numerators and denominators. We proposed (88 FR 23834) the first\nnumerator to be the number of unique individuals who had an encounter and accessed their EHI\nat least once during the reporting period via at least one of three types of methods: (1) third-party\napp using technology certified to “standardized API for patient population services” certification\ncriterion under § 170.315(g)(10); (2) patient portal using technology certified to the “view,\ndownload, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” certification criterion under § 170.315(e)(1) only; or (3) app\n\n\n\n\n\n\noffered by the health IT developer or health care provider using technology certified to the API\ncriterion under § 170.315(g)(10) (if applicable). We proposed (88 FR 23834) a second numerator\nto be the number of unique individuals who accessed their EHI regardless of an encounter during\nthe reporting period using at least one of the same three types of methods identified above. We\nstated that each of these numerators would be stratified or reported by type of method. For\ndetailed background on the proposed measure, we refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88\nFR 23834).\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23834) the first denominator for this measure to be the total number\nof unique individuals who had an encounter during the reporting period. We proposed (88 FR\n23834) the second denominator to be the total number of unique individuals who used at least\none of the types of methods referenced above to access their EHI who had an encounter during\nthe reporting period. We proposed (88 FR 23834) the third denominator to be the total number of\nunique individuals who used at least one of the three types of methods referenced above to\naccess their EHI during the reporting period (regardless of whether the individual had an\nencounter or not).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters representing EHR developers stated that the proposed measure\nwould result in medium to high qualitative ratings of burden, particularly for the encounter-based\nmeasures, and shared suggestions to modify its structure. Several commenters representing\nhealth IT developers recommended separating the measure into two measures: (1) a measure\napplicable to Health IT Modules certified to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion; and (2) a measure\napplicable to Health IT Modules certified to the § 170.315(e)(1) criterion. These commenters\nalso expressed concern that the structure of the measure did not align with product level\nreporting and could create issues and inconsistencies in reporting and interpreting its results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commenters further stated that many Health IT Modules are certified either to §\n170.315(g)(10) or 170.315(e)(1), but very few are certified to both. They suggested that ONC\nrevise the measure to report on patient access (view, download, and transmit) via patient portal\nversus FHIR via apps and reported at the developer level.\n\nCommenters also recommended removing the third access method that was proposed in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23834) referred to as “App offered by the health IT developer\nor health care provider using technology certified to the API criterion under § 170.315(g)(10) (if\napplicable).” They explained that, per the API Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements, developers of certified Health IT Modules shall treat all (similarly situated) app\ndevelopers as the same. Therefore, they would be unable to distinguish whether an app is offered\nby a developer of certified health IT or by a health care provider. Two commenters stated that\nthey would be able to distinguish between access via apps that they developed versus others, but\nthey did not see the relevance of it.\n\nCommenters also requested clarification on the measure structure for numerators and\ndenominators.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the assessment from commenters on the level of effort to\ndevelop this measure. Considering the medium to high burden ratings from health IT developers\nthat commented on the measure, we have made three modifications intended to simplify and\nreduce the burden of implementing the measure while establishing a starting place for initial\nreporting that can be expanded in the future.\n\nFirst, given that commenters indicated that it would be difficult to distinguish whether an\napp is offered by a developer of certified health IT or by a health care provider, we have\nremoved the third method of access to EHI from the measure that we had proposed in the HTI-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23843), referred to as, “App offered by the health IT developer or health\ncare provider using technology certified to the API criterion under § 170.315(g)(10) (if\napplicable).” Second, we have simplified the metrics (formerly referred to as numerators and\ndenominators) by removing the stratification related to methods of access, and instead\nincorporated the stratification in the metrics. This now aligns the metrics to each associated\ncriterion and addresses the concern that very few Health IT Modules are certified to both criteria\n(§ 170.315(g)(10) or § 170.315(e)(1)). Third, as suggested by commenters, we have removed the\nmetrics related to encounters from this measure. We acknowledge that health IT certified to one\ncriterion only, particularly to § 170.315(g)(10), would not be able to report encounters. By\nremoving the requirement around unique individuals with encounters, we expect that developers\nof products certified to only one criterion will be able to report access to EHI via the applicable\nmethod. We also finalized this measure without encounter-based metrics as we considered how\nan encounter-based measure would apply to health IT developers who offer and implement\nintegrated systems across ambulatory and inpatient settings, as well as developers who offer and\nimplement only ambulatory systems and only inpatient systems. For developers offering\nintegrated systems, an individual might have an ambulatory visit and an inpatient visit within the\nreporting period and access their EHI. However, the proposed construction of the encounter-\nbased metrics would have required developers to determine the unique individuals and reconcile\ntheir encounters and EHI access across ambulatory and inpatient value sets, which would be a\ncomplex endeavor. Therefore, this measure does not include encounter-based metrics in efforts\nto reduce both complexity and burden of implementing the measure.\n\nWe will use a third metric, which counts the number of unique individuals who access\ntheir EHI during the reporting period using any method, to assess trends in individuals’ use of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe two methods of access. This will allow ONC to evaluate as developers of certified health IT\ncontinue to make more APIs available under § 170.315(g)(10), and it will also provide insight\ninto individuals’ use of methods beyond those required for certification that are facilitating\npatient access to their electronic health information.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested clarification on whether individuals were expected to\nhave both an encounter during the reporting period and access their EHI during the reporting\nperiod, or whether the reporting period refers only to the encounter. The commenter also\nrequested clarification on whether the individual has ever accessed their EHI should be counted.\n\nA couple of commenters expressed concern about whether deduplication is expected, noting that\nmost denominators and numerators are feasible if developers of certified Health IT Modules are\nnot expected to deduplicate individuals’ access counts. They suggested ONC should either\nchange counts to be transaction-based and avoid unique patient measurement, or clarify that\nunique patient count will be unique only within each instance of the EHR software and cannot be\ndeduplicated across instances.\n\n*Response.* We have revised the encounter-based approach for the measure so that\nencounters are no longer included. With regards to the concern related to deduplication, we\nrequire unique patient counts of access during the reporting period. However, we recognize that\nthe counts would only be unique within each instance of the EHR software. To clarify, the\nmeasure should report on whether individuals accessed their data during the reporting period;\nthis is not a measure of an individual ever accessing their EHI.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that ONC clearly state whether the scope is for\npatients accessing their own records, exclusive of authorized representative access events. Most\ncommenters requested that the measure not include access by authorized representatives. One\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenter requested that ONC should include access by an individual’s authorized\nrepresentative in the measure count.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback on whether patient-authorized\nrepresentatives should count in the measure when they access EHI and note that there was no\nconsensus. While we agree with the commenter suggesting that ONC should include access by\nan individual’s authorized representative, we did not propose this distinction for our measure. As\nsuch, we may incorporate patient-authorized representatives in future rulemaking, noting that it\nwould be beneficial to align this measure with the CMS Promoting Interoperability (PI) Measure\nfor patient access, which similarly counts patients and their authorized representative in the\nnumerator for providing access to patient-authorized representatives for view, download, and\ntransmit (VDT), and apps of the patients’ choice.<sup>194</sup>\nThe finalized measure only counts\nindividuals.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments indicating the need to clarify the definition for access\nto EHI. Some commenters sought further clarification on the proposed methods of portal and\nAPI access for this measure. One commenter asked, in cases where the patient portal may\ndisplay several electronic health information elements on the log-in landing page, if such a\nscenario counts as a patient accessing their EHI via a patient portal. One commenter asked\nwhether patient portal access should count any use of the patient portal or specifically a view,\ndownload, or transmit to a 3rd party activity. Regarding individual access via a developer’s app,\na commenter requested clarity on whether an app using different technology than what is\n\n\nFootnote 194:\nCMS. 2022 MEDICARE PROMOTING INTEROPERABILITY PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS\nAND CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS. Provider to Patient Exchange Objective Fact Sheet\nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/2022-provider-patient-exchange-objective-fact-sheet.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincluded in § 170.315(g)(10) should be counted. For an API, one commenter requested clarity on\nwhether the measure should record the submission of a request for information or the response to\nthe request.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to clarify how access to EHI is defined for the\nfinalized measure. The definitions associated with this measure (as noted earlier) are described in\ndetail in the measure specifications. Access to EHI via patient portal using technology certified\nto the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd party” certification criterion under § 170.315(e)(1) is\ncounted as a patient log-in with the access credential belonging to the individual at least once\nduring the reporting period. Access to EHI via technology certified to the “standardized API for\npatient population services” certification criterion under § 170.315(g)(10) is counted as the\nindividual’s authorization, as indicated by an access token, at least once during the reporting\nperiod. To summarize, access to EHI is based upon an individual logging into a system (whether\nthat be a portal or third-party app or other system) within the reporting period and is not based on\naccessing any specific piece of information or performing any specific action within the system\nitself such as view, download and transmit activities.\n\n*Comments.* We received some comments suggesting expanding the proposed measure.\n\nOne commenter suggested that the data should report on whether individuals are accessing their\nhealth information more than once in the same reporting period. Another suggested that the data\nshould report those individuals who tried to access their health information via the proposed\nmethods and failed. Another commenter suggested reporting “percentage of use” similar to what\nwas proposed for the “use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT” measure to\nmeasure the adoption of API-based means of access by single users in a developer’s client base.\n\nOne commenter noted that the most common method for authenticating users of third-party\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth apps is via their patient portal account and that some patients may only use their portal to\naccess their app of choice. They suggested ONC provide an additional metric to determine\nwhether the portal is being used to access health information directly or to access health\ninformation via a third-party app. Finally, one commenter suggested collecting additional data\nfor this measure to support health equity, suggesting the measure include a patient’s language.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate comments suggesting expanding the measurement of individual\naccess to EHI and agree that there are several important dimensions of access to EHI to explore.\n\nGiven that we also received numerous comments related to the burden associated with reporting\nthe current proposed measures, we have not added the suggested additional requirements at this\ntime, though they may provide further insights. Our intent is to balance the value of the\ninformation we now require to be collected with the burden of doing so. We may consider these\nsuggestions in future iterations of the measure through rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern and requested clarification about how the\nmeasure may reflect on the quality of a developer of certified Health IT Modules’ products. The\ncommenter stated that health care providers have the relationships with patients and provide the\ninstructions to access their health information, while developers have no influence on these\nactivities.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge that there are many factors that influence how and to what\ndegree individuals access their EHI, including those mentioned by commenters. While the results\ndo not solely reflect on the performance of the health IT developers, the methods health IT\ndevelopers provide to access EHI may vary in usability, implementation of functionality, and\nrobustness of functionality, which may influence patient and provider use of EHI. The measure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintends to shed light on the role that health IT plays in facilitating access to EHI through\ndifferent methods.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter asked about the entity that would be responsible for reporting\non the measure in a situation where the health IT developer relies upon a different certified\nHealth IT Module (owned by a separate entity) in order to meet the certification criteria\nassociated with the Insights Condition (in this case § 170.315(e)(1). Specifically, the commenter\nsought clarity on whether the developer of the certified health IT module using the relied upon\nsoftware would be responsible for reporting, or if the developer of that relied upon software\nwould be responsible for reporting.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the request for clarification. In these instances, similar to how\nthis is addressed through the Real World Testing requirements,<sup>195</sup>\nwe would expect a health IT\ndeveloper using relied upon software in its Health IT Module to meet the certification\nrequirement associated with § 170.315(e)(1) to report on this Insights Condition measure on its\nown accord. The health IT developer may work with its relied upon software vendor, if\nnecessary, to report on the metrics.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the measure as “individuals’ access to electronic health information\nthrough certified health IT” in § 170.407(a)(3)(i). We have revised the proposed measure based\non public comments received. Specific metrics to support this finalized measure are listed below\n\n\nFootnote 195:\nONC Health IT Certification Program. Real World Testing Guide. (Last updated: May 23, 2023). See p. 18.\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-08/ONC-\nReal%20World%20Testing%20Resource%20Guide_Aug%202021.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand described further in the accompanying measure specification sheets located on ONC’s\nwebsite. We also note that if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future\n– such as a revision to a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure\nspecification would also be changed to ensure alignment with the revised criterion. The reporting\nperiod for the measure and related metrics below consists of one calendar year. Data collection\nfor the measures and associated metrics will begin during the first phase of reporting (which is\ndescribed later in the preamble):\n1) Number of unique individuals who accessed their EHI during the reporting period\nusing technology certified to the “standardized API for patient population services”\ncertification criterion under § 170.315(g)(10).\n\n2) Number of unique individuals who accessed their EHI during the reporting period\nusing technology certified to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” certification\ncriterion under § 170.315(e)(1).\n\n3) Number of unique individuals who accessed their EHI using any method. The methods\nare not limited to third-party apps using technology certified to “standardized API for\npatient population services” certification criterion under § 170.315(g)(10) or patient\nportals using technology certified to the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty”\ncertification criterion under § 170.315(e)(1) during the reporting period.\n\nMeasurement Area: Clinical Care Information Exchange\nIn HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23834), we proposed two measures under the “clinical\ncare information exchange” area in § 170.407(a)(2) and (3) titled, “C-CDA documents obtained\nusing certified health IT by exchange mechanism” and “C-CDA medications, allergies, and\nproblems reconciliation and incorporation using certified health IT.” These measures primarily\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfocused on characterizing the state of information exchange between health care providers who\nare customers of health IT developers with certified health IT, in contrast to other measures that\ncapture exchange with individuals, public health agencies, and other entities.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters indicated general support for both clinical care\ninformation exchange measures. Commenters representing health care providers valued the\nreconciliation and incorporation measure because effective reconciliation and incorporation of\nmedication, allergy, and problem information through certified health IT benefits patient safety\nand care coordination. Some commenters suggested that examining volume alone would not be a\ngood indicator of interoperability advancement or quality. Rather, measures that focus on the\nefficiency of reconciliation in combination with volume measures would provide better insights\ninto the advancements in interoperability. One commenter suggested removal of both measures.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed for both clinical care exchange measures.\n\nWe believe measuring volume is important as it provides the means to assess the extent that\npatient information is moving between providers to facilitate high value care. Furthermore,\npatient and encounter volume measures help contextualize and interpret other measures designed\nto assess progress related to interoperability. Current measures to understand the magnitude of\ninformation exchange and use are fundamentally limited. For example, as noted in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23835), publicly available information from some health information\nnetworks can be difficult to interpret without also knowing the number of encounters occurring\nat sites using these methods, the number of patients being treated, and other measures of volume.\n\nMeasures intended to provide insight into the volume of information exchanged across the nation\nare not feasible to collect from end users through clinical surveys, and the CMS PI Program\nmeasure is reported by a subset of providers that participate in that program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe agree with commenters that measures of efficiency and effectiveness of health IT to\nsupport deduplication and reconciliation alongside measures of volume of clinical care\ndocuments received and incorporated will provide valuable insight on interoperability trends.\n\nBoth measures are discussed more fully below.\n\nConsolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Documents Obtained Using\nCertified Health IT by Exchange Mechanism Measure\nWe proposed (88 FR 23834 and 23835) to adopt the “C-CDA documents obtained using\ncertified health IT by exchange mechanism” measure in § 170.407(a)(2). We stated that this\nmeasure would report on the volume of C-CDA documents obtained using certified health IT by\nexchange mechanism relative to patient volume, and that a developer of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to the “clinical information reconciliation and incorporation”\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2) would be required to report the proposed numerators\nand denominators for this measure. We refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23834\nthrough 23836) for detailed background on the proposed measure.\n\nWe proposed four numerators and four denominators for this measure (88 FR 23835). We\nnoted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23835 and 23836) that we planned to generate multiple\nmetrics from different combinations of these numerators and denominators. We proposed to\nadopt the following numerators for this measure: (1) number of unique C-CDA documents\nobtained (which we defined for the purpose of this proposal as either C-CDAs that are\nreceived—that is, C-CDAs that have been sent or ‘pushed’ by others and received using certified\nhealth IT or C-CDAs that are queried—that is, C-CDAs that were found or ‘pulled’ from a\nnetwork or central repository using certified health IT) using certified health IT and Direct\nMessaging during the reporting period; (2) number of unique C-CDA documents obtained\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(received or queried) using certified health IT and a local/regional health information exchange\n(HIE) or national health information network (HIN) during the reporting period; (3) number of\nunique C-CDA documents obtained (received or queried) using certified health IT and a\ndeveloper-specific HIN (i.e., a network that facilitates exchange between entities using the same\nhealth IT developer’s products) during the reporting period; and (4) number of unique C-CDA\ndocuments obtained (received or queried) using certified health IT and a method not listed above\nand not including electronic fax during the reporting period.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23835) to adopt the following denominators for this measure: (1)\nnumber of encounters during the reporting period; (2) number of unique patients with an\nencounter during the reporting period; (3) number of unique patients with an associated C-CDA\ndocument during the reporting period; and (4) number of unique C-CDA documents obtained\n(received or queried) using certified health IT during the reporting period. We proposed (88 FR\n23835) to include denominators for the number of encounters during the reporting period and the\nnumber of unique patients seen (i.e., with an encounter) during the reporting period to provide a\nsense of the volume of C-CDA documents exchanged relative to the number of instances when a\nC-CDA document might be useful.\n\n*Comments.* While numerous commenters expressed general support for this measure,\nsome commenters raised concerns. Their major concerns related to: (1) burden associated with\nthe measure and the overall program; potentially including health care providers as they may\nneed to map their exchange partners to different types of networks for reporting purposes; (2)\nrethinking the mechanisms which include a mix of methods and standards that are not mutually\nexclusive; (3) measuring beyond standards that reflect the current state such as FHIR, which may\nbecome dominant in the future; (4) better defining and specifying the selected exchange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmechanisms; and (5) potentially including mechanisms that do not result in structured,\ninteroperable data, such as e-fax, to more fully measure the totality of exchange, including\nexchange across the care continuum with providers who do not possess electronic exchange\ncapabilities.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback and agree with the concerns raised by\ncommenters related to the potential burden of some metrics, including impacts on providers, the\nneed to reduce overall burden associated with the Insights Condition, and the ability to\nmeaningfully distinguish between the proposed exchange mechanisms given the overlap between\nthe use of standards and methods of exchange. Therefore, we have not finalized the “C-CDA\ndocuments obtained using certified health IT by exchange mechanism” measure. Although we\nvalue measuring exchange mechanisms, the ecosystem for HIE methods is evolving, particularly\nwith the launch of TEFCA. The evolving landscape for exchange calls for a measure that tracks\ntrends related to the adoption and use of each mode of exchange to better inform ONC’s policy\nmaking and health care providers’ operational decisions. We may consider proposing a revised\nversion of this measure in a future rulemaking with the intent of capturing trends in how clinical\ninformation is being exchanged, inclusive of FHIR-based exchange.\n\nConsolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Problems, Medications, and\nAllergies Reconciliation and Incorporation Through Certified Health IT Measure\nWe proposed (88 FR 23836) to adopt the “C-CDA medications, allergies, and problems\nreconciliation and incorporation using certified health IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(3), which\nwould capture the number of C-CDA documents that are reconciled and incorporated (as defined\nin § 170.315(b)(2)(iii)) as part of a patient’s record by clinicians or their delegates. We proposed\n(88 FR 23836) that a developer of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“clinical information reconciliation and incorporation” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2)\nwould be required to provide information on how data in C-CDA documents are used, focusing\non the reconciliation and incorporation of medications, allergies and intolerances, and problems.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23836) the numerator to be the total number of C-CDA documents\nof the Continuity of Care Document (CCD), Referral Note, Discharge Summary document types\nthat are obtained and incorporated across all exchange mechanisms supported by the certified\nhealth IT during the reporting period. The numerator would increment, or increase in number,\nupon completion of clinical information reconciliation of the C-CDA documents for medications,\nallergies and intolerances, and problems, as described in the certification criterion in §\n170.315(b)(2).\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23836) the denominators for this measure, using the definition of\n“encounter” described earlier in the preamble of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832), as the\nfollowing: (1) number of encounters during the reporting period; (2) number of unique patients\nwith an encounter during the reporting period; (3) number of unique patients with an associated\nC-CDA document during the reporting period; and (4) number of unique C-CDA documents\nobtained using certified health IT during the reporting period. For this fourth denominator, we\nindicated that we were aware that in the current landscape, some clinicians and hospitals are able\nto receive C–CDA documents through multiple methods and it is possible to receive multiple\ncopies of the same C–CDA (e.g., via Direct Messaging and an HIE). We sought to only include\nunique C–CDA documents in both the numerator and denominator because we believed that\nclinicians were unlikely to reconcile multiple copies of the same C-CDA and that by eliminating\nthese duplicates, we would avoid undercounting reconciliation (88 FR 23837).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters who indicated general support for the measure also\nexpressed concerns about the burden associated with the measure. These commenters noted that\ntheir reports for clients on a similar measure for the CMS PI Program do not necessarily create\nefficiencies in aggregating the data across their clients. One commenter indicated the value of the\nmeasure did not outweigh the burden because many of their clients do not regularly reconcile\nand incorporate documents they obtained.\n\nCommenters representing EHR developers also provided qualitative ratings of burden\nassociated with these measures. They indicated that the data points (e.g.,\nnumerators/denominators) “number of encounters” and “number of unique patients with an\nencounter” would be low level of effort; whereas “number of unique patients with an associated\nC-CDA document” and “number of C-CDA documents of the Continuity of Care Document\n(CCD), Referral Note, Discharge Summary document types that are obtained and incorporated\nacross all exchange mechanisms” would be a high level of effort. The rest of the clinical care\nexchange numerators and denominators were rated as medium level of effort. The commenter\nexpressed that the “number of unique patients with an associated C-CDA document” was rated\nas high in burden because greater clarification was needed related to what the term “associated”\nmeant.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. In response to public\ncomments, we have revised metrics to reduce burden associated with the measure as further\ndiscussed in this section below. We appreciate that aggregating data across clients at the product\nlevel requires additional effort even if the incorporation and reconciliation measure is similar to\nthe CMS PI measure, but we maintain that the existence and use of the similar data structures to\ngenerate reports for clients creates efficiencies for developers relative to the counterfactual, in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich no such data structures currently exist. We believe the measure will provide value\ncommensurate with the burden described by commenters. As noted earlier, commenters\nrepresenting health care providers expressed value in the proposed incorporation and\nreconciliation measure. If providers are not engaging in these activities, it would be useful to\nmake that information more widely known to healthcare organizations, payers, and other\ninterested parties involved with patient safety through this measure. Providers may find the\nmeasures useful to evaluate their workflows and health IT configuration to optimize functionality\nthat supports incorporation and reconciliation.\n\nThe version of the metric included in the measure specification is described in more\ndetail below and in the measure specification itself. We have included the following metrics\ndescribed at 88 FR 23835 in the measure specification: number of encounters during the\nreporting period, number of unique patients with an encounter during the reporting period, and\nnumber of unique patients with an associated C-CDA document during the reporting period.\n\nThese metrics are included as described at 88 FR 23835, except for a revision to the measure of\nencounters described further in this preamble.\n\nWe have revised the metrics, “number of unique C–CDA documents obtained (received\nor queried) using certified health IT during the reporting period” (88 FR 23835) and “the total\nnumber of C–CDA documents of the Continuity of Care Document (CCD), Referral Note,\nDischarge Summary document types that are obtained and incorporated across all exchange\nmechanisms through the certified health IT during the reporting period” (88 FR 23836) to better\ncapture how health IT functions and to reduce requirements specific to the Insights Condition.\n\nThe revisions are further described later in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters requested clarification on whether duplicate\ndocuments should be counted and asked how duplicates should be defined. Some commenters\nrecommended that all documents be counted, whether duplicative or not, because all documents\nmust be managed. Furthermore, one commenter recommended that ONC require that all\ndocuments are counted, whether considered duplicates or not, because whether documents are\nduplicates or not, all must be processed, deduplicated, and reconciled. Comments also indicated\nthat deduplication may not be necessary if the intended purpose is to examine trends over time.\n\nCommenters noted that there is not necessarily industry consensus on what it means for\ninformation to be duplicative. Numerous commenters noted that examining the full content of\ndocuments to verify if documents are duplicates may not be feasible. Most commenters indicated\nthat ONC should limit its definition to duplicates based upon document identifiers as that was the\nmost feasible option, though these commenters acknowledged that relying on document\nidentifiers alone to identify them may not fully capture all duplicative documents.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the input from commenters on how the measures should\nmanage duplicate C-CDAs. In response to feedback, the approach to identifying duplicate C-\nCDAs to support metrics related to unique C-CDA documents, as included in the measure\nspecifications accompanying the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, has been revised. We have removed the\nrequirement for health IT developers to identify C-CDAs that “otherwise contain substantially\nidentical data as identified by developers of certified health IT.”<sup>196</sup>\nIn the measure specification\naccompanying this final rule, we have provided a definition for ““unique C-CDAs” so that\n\n\nFootnote 196:\nONC Health IT Certification Program Insights Condition: Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-\nCDA) Medications, Allergies, and Problems Reconciliation and Incorporation Using Certified Health IT\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/3.Measure_Spec_CCDA_Reconcile_1.3.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduplicate C-CDAs shall be identified based upon document identifier only, and only one of\nmultiple C-CDAs with the same document identifier will be included in a count of unique C-\nCDAs. For example, if an HIE receives a C-CDA from a health care provider and regenerates the\nC-CDA, the content of the document does not change, but the document may have a new\ndocument ID. In this instance, we will not require health IT developers to undertake the effort to\nanalyze the content to determine if it is identical to the original C-CDA’s content, and we\nrecognize that C-CDAs containing identical information would not be counted as a duplicate if\nthey have different document IDs.\n\nWe agree with the commenters who highlighted the work necessary to process,\ndeduplicate, and reconcile both non-duplicative and duplicative C-CDAs, and the importance of\ncapturing the totality of all C-CDAs processed. In response to this comment, we have added a\nmetric as the number of total C-CDA documents obtained, inclusive of potential duplicate\ndocuments as described in the measure specification. This reflects the totality of documents\nmeasured by health IT developers, irrespective of document identifier. This metric relates\ndirectly to the proposed metric “number of unique C-CDA documents obtained using certified\nhealth IT during the reporting period” (88 FR 23835) and would represent the count of C-CDAs\nbefore deduplication processes were applied. Given the substantial comments we received on the\ndeduplication process as described in the measure specification, we believe that this permutation\non the underlying metric was both anticipated by and supported by public comment.\n\nWe have also retained the metric counting the unique number of C-CDAs and have made\na revision by modifying the approach to identifying duplicate C-CDAs underlying this metric.\n\nThe metric, as described in the measure specification accompanying the final rule, is the number\nof unique C-CDA documents obtained. We clarify that unique C-CDAs are identified by\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument ID and only one of multiple C-CDAs with the same document identifier counted. This\nmetric relates directly to the proposed metric following revision of the deduplication process.\n\nThe difference between these two metrics represents the volume of duplicate C-CDAs obtained,\ndetermined by document ID. This is critical to track as health care providers have identified the\npotential negative downstream impacts of duplicate documents exchanged on the complexity of\nexchange and usability of the data.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters indicated that the proposed metric did not explicitly\ninclude important automated aspect of the reconciliation process, which includes deduplication\nthrough automated means. Commenters pointed out that reconciliation by human users can be\nassisted by underlying automation and that there was variation in these practices. For instance, as\nnoted above, commenters expressed concern that there was not industry consensus on how to\ndeduplicate information contained within a C-CDA. The HITAC specifically noted that new\ntools and automated processes are advancing to reduce the human burden involved in reviewing\nexchanged information.<sup>197</sup>\nNumerous commenters also noted that the measure is specifically\nbased on reconciliation actions occurring at the C-CDA document level, whereas many\ndevelopers aggregate data across individual documents for consolidated or “bundled” clinical\nreconciliation for a more user-friendly workflow to deduplicate C-CDAs. Commenters noted the\nmeasure should be modified to better account for bundled reconciliation, and that doing so would\nalign this measure further with the CMS PI Program measures. Numerous commenters\n\n\nFootnote 197:\nHITAC recommendation: HTI-1-PR-TF-2023_Recommendation 33 in Recommendations on the Health Data,\nTechnology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing\n(HTI1) Proposed Rule https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2023-06/2023-06-15_HTI-1-PR-TF-\n2023_Recommendations_Report_Final_508.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecommended that ONC include documents reconciled not only by human users, but those\ndocuments automatically reconciled via electronic tools that reduce the need for manual review\nand reconciliation of data. A commenter expressed that the metric was rated as high in burden\nbecause auto-reconciliation was not included in the proposed measure.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate considerations from commenters on the range of evolving\npractices to automate and support reconciliation and incorporation of C-CDAs, which can reduce\nburden on end-users. As noted above, given this range of practices, we have specified in the\nmeasure specification accompanying this final rule that the identification of unique C-CDAs for\nthe purpose of the Insights Condition depends only on document identifier.\n\nIn proposing within the measure specification to define duplicates based on the inclusion\nof substantially identical information as identified by health IT developers, we intended to reflect\nwhat we understood to be wide variation in developers’ approaches to determining whether\ninformation was duplicative.<sup>198</sup>\nHowever, public comments further highlighting variation in\napproaches to deduplication, particularly automated processes to do so, coupled with comments\nabout similar automated processes that some developers use to reduce burden, indicate that it is\nessential to measure automated processes to meaningfully capture how information in C-CDAs is\nused. Without including metrics on these processes, we believe the metrics as proposed may\nhave led to invalid inferences. For instance, the proposed metrics may have inappropriately\nconflated fully automated processes identifying no new information with processes involving\nclinician review and resulting in new information incorporated into the Health IT Module. This\n\n\nFootnote 198:\nONC Health IT Certification Program Insights Condition: Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-\nCDA) Medications, Allergies, and Problems Reconciliation and Incorporation Using Certified Health IT\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/3.Measure_Spec_CCDA_Reconcile_1.3.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwas confirmed by commenters indicating that it might be infeasible or of little value to\nimplement the proposed metrics in cases where documents were bundled or otherwise pre-\nprocessed.\n\nWe further agree with commenters that changes in health IT systems that reduce provider\nburden are vital. The metrics described in the measure specification accompanying the final rule\nwill facilitate insight into the extent to which health IT systems employ automated processes to\nstreamline reconciliation and incorporation of clinical information and result in greater use of\ninformation in C-CDAs and reduced burden. As a result, the measure will properly reflect the\nsuccess of developers with approaches that create efficiency for the healthcare delivery system.\n\nTo support the final measure and to capture the range of methods that support the\nreconciliation and incorporation process, we use several terms in the measure specification\nsheets accompanying the final rule. For purposes of clarity, we note the terms have the following\nmeanings:\n• “Pre-Processes for Reconciliation and incorporation” is any automated process that (1)\ndeduplicates C-CDAs, for instance, based on document identifier, the information\ncontained within multiple C-CDAs, or other means; (2) removes information for user\nreview that is identical to information in the Health IT Module; (3) aggregates data across\ndocuments for bundled reconciliation; or (4) uses another means to process C-CDAs to\nfacilitate manual (by a clinician or their delegate) or fully automated reconciliation and\nincorporation of information into the Health IT Module.\n\n• “Reconciled and Incorporated via Any Method” is any approach to reconciling and\nincorporating information in the Health IT Module, including but not limited to manual\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocesses performed by a clinician or their delegate only; a mix of manual and automated\nprocesses; or fully automated processes. This includes an affirmative action to (1)\nreconcile new information from the C-CDA into the Health IT Module, for instance, by\ncomparison of medication information in the Health IT Module and information in the C-\nCDA; or (2) indicate that no new information needs to be incorporated into the Health IT\nModule.\n\n• “Fully automated processes for reconciliation and incorporation” is any process by\nwhich problems, medications, or allergies and intolerances contained within C-CDAs are\nautomatically reconciled with information within certified health IT and incorporated into\nhealth IT without an action by a clinician end-user or their delegate. These processes\ninclude (1) reconciling new information from the C-CDA into the Health IT Module, for\ninstance, by comparison of medication information in the Health IT Module and\ninformation in the C-CDA; or (2) determining that no new information needs to be\nincorporated into the Health IT Module.\n\n• “Determined to have no new problems, medications, or allergies and intolerances\ninformation” is any pre-process or fully automated process that determines that the C-\nCDA contains no new information.\n\nIn consideration of public comment received on the proposed measure, we have included\nmore specific metrics in the measure specification accompanying the final rule. Three metrics\naccount for pre-processes and fully automated processes related to reconciling and incorporating\nC-CDAs and two more clearly framed metrics related to C-CDAs for which automated processes\nwere not applied. We made these adjustments to better reflect developers’ existing practices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelated to deduplication and similar pre-processing, including the bundling of C-CDAs described\nin public comment on the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and accompanying measurement specification.\n\nIn contrast to the original measure in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we have not finalized a\nrequirement that any complex deduplication be performed specifically for the Insights Condition\nby those developers who do not currently deduplicate or otherwise automatically process C-\nCDAs, which will result in reduced burden on developers.\n\nIn so doing, we believe the updated metrics represent a direct evolution of the focus in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule on deduplication that is responsive to comments and reduces burden on\ndevelopers. To that end, in the measure specification accompanying this final rule, we sub-\ndivided the proposed metrics to more precisely capture rates of pre-processes and fully\nautomated processes described by commenters.\n\n• In addition to the metric, number of unique C-CDA documents obtained, we have also\nincluded two metrics to enable the proper and accurate capture of the use of pre-\nprocessing that may facilitate efficient and effective review of information contained\nwithin C-CDA documents: (1) number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were\npre-processed, and (2) number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-\nprocessed. Following the change to what constitutes a duplicate C-CDA previously\ndiscussed, the number of unique C-CDAs will reflect elimination of an important subset\nof duplicate C-CDAs, but will not reflect more complex deduplication processes. The\ncomplementary metrics reflect the extent that developers performed pre-processes,\ninclusive of those deduplication processes, for obtained C-CDAs. This approach\neliminates the need to perform specific, complex deduplication processes for the Insights\nCondition and the final metrics should decrease developer burden compared to what was\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproposed. We expect that some developers that do not have the capability to pre-process\nC-CDAs would report a zero for the first metric.\n\n• We have divided the proposed metric “number of C-CDA documents of the Continuity of\nCare Document (CCD), Referral Note, Discharge Summary document types that are\nobtained and incorporated across all exchange mechanisms supported by certified health\nIT during the reporting period” into two metrics to more clearly differentiate between\nreconciliation activities that were and were not supported by pre-processes: (1) number of\ntotal C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed where problems, medications,\nor allergies and intolerances were reconciled and incorporated via any method; and (2)\nnumber of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed where problems,\nmedications, or allergies and intolerances were reconciled and incorporated via any\nmethod. This division was made in response to public comment requesting that we\nspecify how the proposed metrics accounted for pre-processing and requesting that we\nreduce the complexity of C-CDA processing necessary, specifically for the Insights\nCondition. We expect that some developers that do not have the capability to pre-process\nC-CDAs would report a zero for the first measure.\n\nFinally, we have included a specific standalone metric to capture fully automated\nprocesses that did not result in new information. In the proposed measure specification, we\nstated, “if no update is necessary, the process of reconciliation may consist of simply verifying\nthat fact or reviewing a record received and determining that such information is merely\nduplicative of existing information in the patient record.” We believe that this statement was\nambiguous about whether automated processes for making this determination would count as\nreconciliation, and commenters indicated as much by comparison to the CMS PI measure. Given\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenters’ interest in highlighting various approaches to processing C-CDAs, we have\nincluded a metric focused directly on this process as the number of total C-CDA documents\nobtained that were determined to have no new problems, medications, or allergies and\nintolerances information by pre-processes or fully automated processes. This metric is intended\nto disambiguate how to capture pre-processes and fully automated processes for verifying that no\nnew information was available relative to the measure specification accompanying the HTI-1\nProposed Rule.\n\nWe believe this approach will facilitate measurement of C-CDAs that are bundled\ntogether prior to end-user review. For instance, if the bundle is not reviewed by a clinician end\nuser or their delegate and information is not automatically reconciled and incorporated, the\nmetric related to reconciling information that has been pre-processed described above would not\ninclude C-CDAs that contained new information presented in a bundle. Prior to manual review,\nC-CDAs that contributed no new information to the bundle could either be counted as\ncontributing to both the metric related to reconciling information that has been pre-processed and\nthe metric related to determining that the C-CDA contained no new information, or to neither\nmetric depending on the approach that most closely matched the product’s logic. Once manual\nreview of a bundled C-CDAs is completed, each C-CDA that comprised the bundled review\nwould increment the metric related to reconciling information that has been pre-processed above,\nand those that contributed no new information to the bundle would increment the metric related\nto determining that the C-CDA contained no new information as well. We have adopted this\napproach to acknowledge the health IT systems that have functionality that streamlines the\nreconciliation process, with the interest of understanding how this functionality reduces burden\nfor end users. We recognize that today many developers may apply no pre-processes or fully\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautomated processes to obtained C-CDAs, and these developers would report a zero for these\nmetrics.\n\nC-CDA documents obtained via all mechanisms (including from national networks, such\nas the Carequality framework and CommonWell, Direct Trust, and eHealth Exchange; Health IT\nDeveloper networks; EHR to EHR exchange; regional, local, and community HIE; and Direct\nSecure Messaging) should be counted in the measure. However, we clarify that the measure does\nnot require any stratification by exchange mechanism.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter raised a concern that it would be difficult to deduplicate\npatients across EHR instances and thus ONC should clarify that deduplication across EHR\ninstances is not expected.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the request for clarification. We recognize that this requirement\nrepresents a significant level of burden and do not expect deduplication of patients across EHR\ninstances for this measure.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters recommended to include any valid C-CDA R2.1 IG\ndocument-level template for measurement, as opposed to only the CCD, Discharge Summary,\nand Referral Note templates described in the measure specifications sheets related to this\nmeasure. Some commenters also noted that including a broader set of document types would\nbetter capture the full scope of C-CDA document exchange that is active in healthcare today and\naligns with CMS PI Program. Additionally, one commenter representing health IT developers\nnoted it would be less burdensome to include all documents, rather than only the subset, as they\ndid not have the capability to identify the subset. Relatedly, numerous commenters also\nsuggested that we modify the definition for obtaining C-CDAs. Many commenters indicated that\nexcluding C-CDA without any data would be problematic as that would involve reviewing the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent of the C-CDA which would be burdensome. One commenter noted that a C-CDA\nwithout any data (such as a patient header) would be rejected and not counted. Some commenters\nsuggested including any document received inbound that is in a valid file format with a header\nindicating that it is a C-CDA R2.1 document template.\n\n*Response.* In an effort to align with the “automated measure calculation” (§\n170.315(g)(2)) criterion that health IT developers follow to support reporting the CMS measures,\nwe have revised the measure specification so that the measure includes any valid C-CDA\ndocument-level template referred to in the standards adopted for certification to § 170.315(b)(2)\nfor measurement, as opposed to only the CCD, Discharge Summary, and Referral Note\ntemplates. This brings the measure into alignment with the CMS PI Program measure (Support\nElectronic Referral Loops By Receiving and Reconciling Health Information), which states\n“Starting in 2019, for the Promoting Interoperability measure an EP may use any document\ntemplate within the C-CDA standard for the purposes of the measure.” We note that this scope is\nsubstantially broader than the “clinical information and reconciliation and incorporation” (§\n170.315(b)(2)) criterion, which only requires that certified Health IT Modules be able to\nreconcile and incorporate Continuity of Care Document, Referral Note, and (inpatient setting\nonly) Discharge Summary. We will not require developers to exclude documents without data,\nacknowledging that some developers do not parse or otherwise pre-process C-CDAs and,\ntherefore, cannot readily evaluate whether the C-CDA contains data. We plan to collaborate with\nthe community to determine if more nuanced levels of analysis are warranted for future measure\nupdates to refine the measure.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters asked ONC for clarification on the proposed denominator,\n“number of unique patients with an associated C-CDA document during the reporting period.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne commenter indicated they were not sure how it differed from “documents obtained” in one\nof the other denominators and whether it was intended to only capture new associations that\noccurred during a reporting period or a snapshot of all patients at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOne commenter also inquired about how to count a document received during one reporting\nperiod but matched in another reporting period.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that the metric, number of unique patients with an associated C-\nCDA document during the reporting period, refers to the number of unique patients that have\nbeen matched to at least one C-CDA within the certified Health IT Module by automated or\nmanual means in the reporting period and, therefore, have at least one associated C-CDA. The\nmetric, number of total C-CDA documents obtained through certified health IT during the\nreporting period, refers to the total number of C-CDA documents obtained across all patients for\nthe reporting period. For example, if two C-CDAs were received for a single patient during the\nreporting period, the first metric would count this as a single unique patient, while the second\nmetric would count this as two C-CDAs. These counts would not depend on whether information\nhad previously been received for a patient prior to the reporting period. As noted in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, we believe these denominators support an understanding of the volume of C-\nCDA documents exchanged relative to the number of instances when external information could\ninform health care providers.\n\nWith regard to documents that may be obtained in one reporting period and reconciled in\nanother reporting period, the measure’s metrics call for counting C-CDAs obtained, reconciled,\nand incorporated in the same reporting period. We recognize that some C-CDAs obtained prior\nto the reporting period, but reconciled and incorporated during the reporting period, are not\ncounted in the metrics. However, we expect these instances will not substantially impact the\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninterpretation of the metrics’ results. We also recognize that some C-CDAs obtained during the\nreporting period may be reconciled and incorporated following the reporting period, but similarly\nbelieve these instances will be uncommon. We expect that the shift to calendar year reporting\nwill further minimize the exclusion of documents that are received before the start of a reporting\nperiod and reconciled during the start of the reporting period.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested the encounter-based metrics may not adequately\nmeasure one of the key areas of interest, which is to assess the extent to which exchange of\noutside information can potentially inform care. This commenter suggested that to identify the\nextent to which encounters benefited from information exchange would require a denominator of\ntotal number of encounters during the reporting period, and a numerator of encounters in which\ninformation from a C-CDA document was incorporated. Such a measure would provide the\npercentage of encounters in which outside information was potentially beneficial to the\nencounter was incorporated from received documents.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenter that many variations on the required metrics\ncould provide additional insight into how exchanged information is used and that measures\nrelated to the proportion of encounters in which obtained information was incorporated could be\nparticularly insightful. However, we have sought to balance that consideration against the\npotential for additional burden associated with the measure. To that end, we decline to revise or\nextend measures to capture the proportion of encounters in which information was incorporated.\n\nWe plan to continue to collaborate with the community to investigate the degree of development\nnecessary to link C-CDAs incorporated to their use to inform care during an encounter.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters raised questions regarding what actions count as\nreconciliation. One commenter requested clarification on whether a document would be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsidered incorporated if any amount of data was incorporated or by specific data element. A\ncouple of commenters requested ONC be more explicit about what types of data are included for\nreconciliation, asking whether a document should be included only if it had problems, allergies,\nor medications (PAM) for reconciliation, or if reconcilable laboratory results (e.g., blood tests) or\nimmunizations should also be included. A commenter requested that ONC limited it to\nreconciliation of PAM, given that it is a certification requirement, and that the numerator be\nexplicitly defined in that manner. Relatedly, a couple of commenters recommended that if a\ndocument did not contain any new information to be reconciled that it should still increment the\nnumerator to match the existing CMS PI measure. Another commenter requested that ONC\nclarify that viewing documents is not equivalent to reconciling documents.\n\n*Response.* Our intent is to align the measure requirements with the “clinical information\nreconciliation and incorporation” (§ 170.315(b)(2)) certification criterion. As such, we describe\nin the measure specification accompanying the final rule that metrics related to reconciliation of\nC-CDAs would increment upon reconciliation of medications, allergies and intolerances, or\nproblems. The two metrics are: (1) number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-\nprocessed where problems, medications, or allergies and intolerances were reconciled and\nincorporated via any method; and (2) number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not\npre-processed where problems, medications, or allergies and intolerances were reconciled and\nincorporated via any method. We clarify that the increment occurs when reconciliation is\ncompleted for any one of the three types of data, that is, when at least one medication, allergy\nand intolerance, or problem is reconciled and incorporated or when it is determined that no new\ninformation should be incorporated. We agree with the recommendation from commenters that\ndocuments that do not contain any new information for reconciliation should still increment the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetrics when an end-user or automated process verifies the fact that information in the C-CDA is\nduplicative of existing information in the patient record to match the existing CMS PI measure.\n\nThe third metric, number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were determined to have no\nnew problems, medications, or allergies and intolerances information by pre-processes or fully\nautomated processes, would also increment when automated processes were used to make this\ndetermination. We believe that distinguishing between automated processes that identify no new\ninformation and other reconciliation is important for a valid understanding of the use of\ninformation and burden on end-users. We clarify that the act of simply viewing a C-CDA,\nwithout an affirmative action verifying that information is either absent or duplicative, would not\nincrement these metrics.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested focusing measurement on transitions between\noutside organizations/systems, as patients within health systems are often referred, admitted, and\ndischarged to providers within the same system which might make it difficult to interpret the\nresults.\n\n*Response.* The measure is intended to count C-CDAs that must be exchanged outside of a\n“one patient one chart” system, where multiple specialists within a system can access a single\npatient record and manage a single list for problems, medications, and medication allergies. We\nnote that this measure applies to intra-system exchange, where specialists within the same\nprovider organization do not have access to a “one patient one chart” health IT system, and inter-\nsystem exchange, where specialists across different provider organizations also do not have\naccess to a “one patient one chart” health IT system. We also note that this measure is not limited\nto transitions of care. We may consider if the measure should be reported by transitions of care in\nfuture rulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the measure as “consolidated clinical document architecture (C-CDA)\nproblems, medications, and allergies reconciliation and incorporation through certified health IT\"\nin § 170.407(a)(3)(ii). We have revised the proposed measure based on public comments\nreceived related to variation in industry practices, including approaches to deduplication and\nautomation. Specific metrics to support this finalized measure are described in the related\nmeasure specification located on ONC’s website and in the section above. We also note that if\nregulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a revision to a\ncriterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification would also be\nchanged to ensure alignment with the revised criterion:\n-1. Number of encounters\n-2. Number of unique patients with an encounter\n-3. Number of unique patients with an associated C-CDA document\n-4. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained\n-5. Number of unique C-CDA documents obtained\n-6. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed\n-7. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed\n-8. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were pre-processed where problems,\nmedications, or allergies and intolerances were reconciled and incorporated via any method\n-9. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were not pre-processed where\nproblems, medications, or allergies and intolerances were reconciled and incorporated via any\nmethod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-10. Number of total C-CDA documents obtained that were determined to have no new\nproblems, medications, or allergies and intolerances information by pre-processes or fully\nautomated processes\nThe reporting period for the measure and related metrics consists of one calendar year.\n\nData collection for the measures and associated metrics will begin during the second and third\nphases of reporting (which is described later in the preamble).\n\nMeasurement Area: Standards Adoption and Conformance\nWe proposed (88 FR 23837) to adopt four measures in the “standards adoption and\nconformance” area in § 170.407(a)(4) through (7) to provide insight into the role that standards\nplay in enabling the access, exchange, and use of EHI. We proposed to measure the following\naspects within this area: (1) availability of apps to support access to EHI for a variety of\npurposes; (2) the usage of FHIR-based APIs to support apps; (3) the use of bulk FHIR to support\nthe access to EHI for groups of individuals; and (4) the use of EHI export functionality (88 FR\n23837). We stated that together, these measures will provide a foundation for understanding\nwhether and to what extent ONC’s policies to promote standards are supporting users of health\nIT, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and others to access, exchange, and use EHI via\ncertified health IT for a variety of purposes. These measures would also provide visibility into\nindustry adoption of standards required by the Program and provide data to inform future\nstandards development work.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters supported the “standards adoption and conformance”\nmeasurement area. One commenter expressed support for interoperability measurement as a\nnational priority. One commenter disagreed with ONC’s statement that data on the volume of\ninformation exchanged would provide the means to assess the extent that patient information is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmoving between providers to facilitate high value care, stating that pure volume does not\naccurately reflect quality.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters and agree that only\ncollecting data on the volume of information exchanged will not strictly reflect the quality of\ncare provided. However, we plan to use this data in conjunction with other collected data from\nthe “Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification” to create metrics that will assess the\nextent that patient information is exchanged between providers to facilitate high value care.\n\n*Comments.* We received numerous comments with suggestions for new or revised\nmeasures in the “standards adoption and conformance” area. Throughout this measurement area\nwe use the abbreviation “app” for the term application. Apps that may connect to ONC-certified\nhealth IT via the capabilities enabled by 170.315(g)(10), refer to third-party software or IT\nsystem not offered by the certified health IT developer including but not limited to: mobile apps,\nweb portals, locally hosted software, enterprise software solutions, and custom software.\n\nFor the “applications supported through certified health IT” measure, the majority of\ncomments received suggested metrics focused on the availability (e.g., number of distinct apps)\nand accessibility (e.g., number of accesses) of patient-facing and non-patient-facing apps. Two\ncommenters suggested metrics focused on requesting additional qualitative context/information\nabout the purpose for which apps were developed or use cases, especially for specialty care apps,\nand clinical decision support. One commenter requested for app developers to report the\nturnaround time for app developer authentication and authorization to production environments.\n\nOne commenter requested for app attestation to be included in the Insights Condition\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the “use of FHIR in apps supported by certified API technology” measure, a majority\nof the comments suggested metrics focused on IG development, adoption, and conformance\nbeyond the US Core IG. One commenter requested a metric that counts the number of queries\nmade by either a patient or a clinician. One commenter suggested counting the total number of\nFHIR resources by individual resource.\n\nFor the “use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT” measure, most of the\ncommenters suggested metrics focused on obtaining information related to the FHIR Bulk Data\nrequest metadata (i.e., user-type of the FHIR Bulk Data requester, export time per resource\n(average), and group size for successful exports (average)). One commenter suggested a metric\nthat counts the number of FHIR Bulk Data export requests. Another commenter suggested a\nmetric that focuses on real-world performance of FHIR Bulk Data implementations.\n\n*Response.* We thank all commenters for their thoughtful input. We appreciate the interest\nexpressed in requiring additional reporting metrics for the “standards adoption and conformance”\nmeasurement area, and may explore the feasibility of these suggested reporting metrics in the\nfuture.\n\nApplications Supported Through Certified Health IT Measure\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23837), we proposed to adopt the “applications\nsupported through certified health IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(4), which would provide\ninformation on how certified health IT supports the health app ecosystem by asking certain\nhealth IT developers under the Program to report app names and app developer names, intended\napp purposes, intended app users, and whether a registered app is in “active” use across a\ndeveloper’s client base (as further detailed below). We stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that\nthis measure would result in a listing of apps that could be used to generate a variety of metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to the “standardized API\nfor patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) criterion would be required to report data\nfor this measure.\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23837 through 23840), we proposed that developers\nof certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) provide certain\ninformation about the apps that are connected to their certified technology. We proposed that the\napp name and the developer (company/organization or individual) responsible for the app would\nbe reported for each app registered to a developer of certified health IT whose Health IT Module\nis certified to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion. We noted that the app registration process required\nunder § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) may provide an opportunity for developers of certified health IT to\ngather standard information for apps connecting to their certified API technology as part of\nexisting workflows. There may be other mechanisms besides the app registration process by\nwhich developers of certified health IT wish to obtain this information.\n\nWe proposed that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(g)(10) obtain and report the intended purpose(s) for each app connected to their certified\nAPI technology using the following categories:\n• Administrative Tasks (e.g., scheduling & check-in, billing & payment)\n• Clinical Tools (e.g., clinical decision support, risk calculators, remote patient monitoring)\n• Individuals’ Access to their EHI (e.g., enables patients to access their health information,\nmedications, test results, vaccine records)\n• Research (e.g., used to perform clinical research)\n• Population Data (e.g., bulk transfer of data, population analytics & reporting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Public Health (e.g., electronic case reporting)\n• Patient-Provider Communication (e.g., secure messaging, telehealth)\n• Educational Resources (e.g., patient and provider educational resources)\n• Other Intended Purpose\n• Unknown (e.g., missing)\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23838), developers of certified health IT to\nwhom the measure applies would report the intended purpose(s) of the app for each app\nregistered to their Health IT Module(s) certified to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion. The categories\nwe proposed under this measure were informed by app category taxonomies in published\nliterature from Barker & Johnson (2021),<sup>199</sup>\nRitchie and Welch (2020),<sup>200</sup>\nand Gordon and Rudin\n(2022).<sup>201</sup>\nWhile we recognized this taxonomy may need to evolve over time, we conveyed in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule our belief that the proposed categories represented a large majority of the\ncurrent market, and that the types of information, if reported on a complete set of apps, would\nprovide insightful information to guide ONC’s future efforts to support individuals' access to\ntheir EHI via apps, along with other priority uses, such as research and clinical care.\n\nAdditionally, we proposed (88 FR 23838) that developers of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) obtain the following intended user(s) categories\nfor each app connected to their certified API technology:\n\n\nFootnote 199:\nThe ecosystem of apps and software integrated with certified health information technology:\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/11/2379/6364773?login=false.\n\n\nFootnote 200:\nCategorization of Third-Party Apps in Electronic Health Record App Marketplaces: Systematic Search and\nAnalysis: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293052/.\n\n\nFootnote 201:\nGordon WJ, Rudin RS.

JAMIA Open. 2022 Apr 6;5(2):ooac023.\ndoi: 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac023. PMID: 35474716; PMCID: PMC9030107.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Individual/Caregiver\n• Clinician\n• Healthcare Organization\n• Payer\n• Researcher\n• Other Intended User\n• Unknown (e.g., missing)\nWe also proposed (88 FR 23838) that developers of certified health IT with Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) obtain the status for each app connected to their certified\nAPI technology using the following categories:\n• Actively Used – An app is defined as “Actively Used” if EHI has been transferred to the\napp using certified API technology for 10 or more unique patients during the reporting\nperiod\n• Not Actively Used – An app is defined as “Not Actively Used” if EHI has been\ntransferred to the app using certified API technology for fewer than 10 unique patients\nduring the reporting period\nComments. Most commenters, including EHR and app developers, as well as commenters\nrepresenting health care providers, were generally supportive of this measure and provided\nspecific requests for clarification and recommendations to constrain the measure. Several\ncommenters indicated that the data collection burden is high for this measure. One commenter\nexpressed concerns that the reporting of these data could lead the public to believe that health IT\ndevelopers had a role in recruiting application developers to connect to § 170.315(g)(10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother commenter recommended that this information be collected directly from application\nvendors to reduce burden on health IT developers.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their general support. We believe this measure\nprovides greater transparency regarding apps that are connected to certified health IT.\n\nSpecifically, this measure would enable ONC and the public to understand to what degree apps\nare connecting across different certified health IT products, which is important for enabling\nindividuals’ access to their EHI. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25750) emphasized the\nimportance of standardization, transparency, and pro-competitive business practices through the\nAPI Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements that would make it easier for\nthird-party apps to connect to certified health IT, and subsequently facilitate individuals' access\nto their EHI. This measure also provides insights into the types of apps that integrate with\ncertified health IT. Collecting this information will be beneficial to developers as well, for it will\nprovide them with insights about available technologies and uses for data that are in demand in\nthe marketplace.\n\nWe acknowledge that collecting this information may require new or updates to existing\ndata collection as part of the app developer registration processes. Although developers\nexpressed concerns related to the burden associated with collecting this information, most\ncommenters indicated that they have an existing app registration process, and thus we believe\nthat developers of certified health IT are best positioned to collect and report this measure. The\napp registration process would provide an opportunity to gather standard information for apps\nconnecting to their certified health IT as part of existing workflows. We currently do not have\ndata regarding which apps are connected to their developers’ health IT and thus cannot directly\ncollect this information. We also recognize that health IT developers do not recruit application\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers to connect to certified health IT, but rather are collecting this information among\nthose application vendors that are connected to their systems and through the app registration\nprocesses.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters recommended that ONC directly acknowledge that\nmandatory collection of intended purposes and intended users via the health IT developer\nregistration process would not violate the API Condition of Certification. One health IT\ndeveloper expressed concern that some of the measures will require collection of new types of\ndata, specifically app categories and audiences. Commenters representing app developers\nindicated they supported this measure and furthermore had suggestions for additional measures\nto include.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments, and note that the collection of app information\nrequired for this Insights Condition measure will not violate the API Condition and Maintenance\nof Certification (§ 170.404(b)). Specifically, the requirements in § 170.404(b) enable a Certified\nAPI Developer to institute its own process to register applications for production use, so long as\nit occurs within five days of completing its verification of an API User’s authenticity. We do not\nbelieve requiring app developers to provide basic information such as the characteristics of their\napplication, including intended users and purpose, to be creating undue burden on app\ndevelopers. Given the support we received for this measure, including from app developers, we\ndo not believe this will be a widespread concern or issue. However, we remind Certified API\nDevelopers that the registration process must still occur in the allotted five business days of\ncompleting its verification of an API User's authenticity, pursuant to paragraph §\n170.404(b)(1)(i) and consistent with § 170.404(b)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters had questions related to which apps would be subject for\ninclusion in this measure. Commenters representing EHR developers inquired whether\napplications relevant for this measure would be exclusively those registered for and using the\nscope of FHIR resources required under the scope of the relevant program criterion at §\n170.315(g)(10). Another commenter indicated that some § 170.315(g)(10) certified health IT\ndoes not transfer patient EHI and requested clarification on whether this technology would be\nsubject to reporting for this measure.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and offer the following clarifications. Any app that\nis registered via the app registration process for the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion is subject for\ninclusion in this measure. We note that the apps that are used by a variety of interested parties to\ninteract with health IT certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are in scope and could include, but are not\nlimited to, provider-, patient-, and payer-oriented apps. This variety is also reflected in the\ncategory of intended user types we plan to collect. We did not fully understand the comment\nregarding a § 170.315(g)(10) certified health IT that does not transfer patient EHI because that is\nthe primary point of such technology. As a result, we are unable to provide further clarity in\nresponse to the comment aside to reiterate that all apps registered through the § 170.315(g)(10)\napp registration process is in scope for this measure.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters indicated that it would be difficult to collect additional\ninformation from app developers that are already registered with their certified health IT and that\nnew information will not be collected until app developers need to re-register their app. Thus,\nONC should expect a disproportionate number of “unknown” entries related to intended purpose\nof app and users during early years of reporting. Another commenter indicated that it would be\nunable to capture this information for applications that do not register with the developer of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertified health IT. One commenter noted that with a dynamic client registration process, where\nthe registration of applications with an authorization server would be done dynamically using a\ntrust framework, might lead to attributes needing to be collected as part of the registration\nassertion process. They recommended that this may need to be reviewed, perhaps by a FHIR at\nScale Taskforce (FAST) workgroup.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments, and recognize that the measure data may not\nbe as comprehensive initially as it will be in future years since the year 2026 will be the first\nmeasure collection phase and some health care providers will still be implementing §\n170.315(g)(10) upgrades. Thus, there may be many “unknown” entries in early years of\nreporting, and as apps re-register, this information would be provided. Many developers certified\nto § 170.315(g)(10) may require app developers to register via a process that allows for the\ncollection of the data required for this measure. To the commenter who indicated app\ninformation may be missing for those apps that do not register, we recognize that apps not\nconnected to the certified (§ 170.315(g)(10) API (and therefore not required to register) would\nnot be included. We also note that while the app registration process required under §\n170.315(g)(10)(iii) may provide an opportunity to collect this information, developers of\ncertified health IT may wish to use other mechanisms such as surveys, forms, or health IT\nsystem-based methods to obtain this information. We are not limiting or specifying the methods\nby which developers of certified health IT collect this information. Developers should describe\nthe method(s) they used to collect the data in the required documentation they submit to ONC.\n\nFurther, we believe it will be possible to collect these data through the dynamic client\nregistration process; however, we note that existing dynamic registration implementation guides\nmay need additional specification. We appreciate the recommendation to consult with a FAST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworkgroup or other groups working on dynamic client registration to ensure that this step is\nincluded as part of that process.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter supported the proposed collection of user type (intended user\nof app) for apps and encouraged collection of information that would identify the types of users\nthat are the focus of the app (e.g., patient, provider, system) to the dataset of information\ncollected about apps. Another commenter requested clarification between “clinician” and\n“healthcare organization.” One commenter suggested that the value sets for metrics, intended\npurpose of app and intended user of app, be based upon a standardized value set referenced in\nother interoperability initiatives such as TEFCA and HL7 Role Class, respectively. One\ncommenter also noted that some apps may have multiple intended purposes and intended users\nand wanted to confirm that reporting of multiples where relevant was acceptable.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the input provided by commenters on establishing or selecting\nan available value set for intended purpose and intended user. We agree that “clinician” and\n“healthcare organization” may seem duplicative and to avoid confusion we have revised the\nvalue set by removing both of these options and replacing “clinician” with “clinical team” and\n“healthcare organization” with “healthcare administrator/executive.” We appreciate the\nrecommendation to consider standardized value sets and may consider identifying relevant value\nsets in future rulemaking. With regards to selection of metrics, intended purpose, and intended\nuser, we understand that there may be multiple purposes and users so apps should select all that\napply and not be limited to one response. Therefore, these are the following intended user(s)\ncategories for each app connected to their certified health IT:\n• Individual/Caregiver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Clinical Team\n• Healthcare Administrator/Executive\n• Payer\n• Researcher\n• Other Intended User\n• Unknown (e.g., missing)\nComments. Several commenters requested clarification on whether an application is\n“actively used” or “not actively used,” noting applications that are “not actively used” are not a\nreflection of the certified health IT. One commenter recommended that an application should be\ndesignated as actively used based upon either a particular threshold of total API call volume, or\ntotal authorization events constituting a unique user session for the app. The commenter\nindicated that this approach would help ensure that apps used in high frequency for retrieving\nhealth information on a small number of patients are not erroneously classified as “not actively\nused.” The same commenter expressed concern about a threshold of 10 or more unique patients,\nindicating that an app that is used daily by fewer patients should still be considered “actively\nused,” especially for developers that may only serve a smaller scope of providers. Another\ncommenter suggested an additional category of “evaluating” that represents an app is connected\nbut used by fewer individuals (such as 3 or 5), along with a “superactive” designation for larger\nnumbers of individuals, therefore creating four categories, rather than two.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We realize that usage of apps is not\nnecessarily a reflection on health IT developers. However, this information is critical to collect in\norder to distinguish between production apps that are registered and are in use (e.g., 10 or more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunique patients), production apps that are registered and are not in use (e.g., less than 10 unique\npatients), and production apps that are registered but not enabled by the health IT developer.\n\nWithout this information, the value of the overall data would be limited.\n\nThe definition of active use is described in our measure specification. The definition is\nbased on whether EHI has been transferred to the app using certified health IT for ten (10) or\nmore unique patients during the reporting period. By setting the threshold at ten or more unique\npatients, we expect that this threshold will represent active use. While mobile patient portal apps\nand well-known healthcare apps (e.g., Apple Health) have large user bases, for lesser-known\nhealthcare apps that filled specific healthcare segments (e.g., rare or terminal diseases, chronic or\nhereditary diseases, age-related conditions, pediatrics, behavioral and mental health), ONC\nexpects smaller user bases.<sup>202</sup>\nAn ONC internal analysis of the Google Play™ store data found\nthat the number of Android installs for apps that enable patients to access their data, ranged from\n4 to over 400,000. There is little public data on number of users specifically, and thus, in setting\nthe criteria of active use, we are relying upon the number of installs for these types of apps, even\nthough it is not equivalent to the number of users. A mix of self-reported data show\napproximately 3.87 million people use health and fitness apps, and data from app stores list\napproximately 350,000 mobile health apps (many of which include apps that do not integrate\nwith EHRs and are not applicable to this metric); on average, health apps have approximately 11\nusers each.<sup>203</sup>\nHowever, none of these data sources provide data on actual use for the apps that\nconnect with EHRs. We aim to be broad in determining active use and balance the need to define\napp use to include apps that have a smaller target audience. Thus, we have set a relatively low\n\n\nFootnote 202:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2020-11/Accelerating_APIs_Consumer_Perspective.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 203:\nhttps://www.mobius.md/2021/10/25/11-mobile-health-statistics/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthreshold of ten or more unique patients for defining active use. We appreciate the alternative\nsuggestions for measuring whether an app is actively used. However, using total API call volume\nto measure usage would skew results and make it difficult to determine appropriate level of API\ncalls to qualify for “active use,” as certain apps may make API calls multiple times per day. A\nlower threshold of less than ten users that would also take into account the use of apps on a daily\nor weekly basis may be more complex to implement, as this also involves measuring the\nfrequency of use (as opposed to simply the number of users). Also, the call or requested data\n(which would be used to assess frequency of use) may be difficult to interpret as apps using APIs\nregularly request data from providers as part of their process to update the data within the app,\nand it may not reflect user driven behavior. The other suggested alternative, using authorization\nevents, could be difficult to implement because it would be difficult to determine the number of\nauthorization events that would define whether an app is actively used given the number of\nauthorization events could vary by individual and app. However, we plan to continue\ncollaborating with the community to assess level of usage using authorization events for future\niterations of this measure.\n\nWith regards to expanding usage from two to four categories, we may consider\nexpanding categories in the future.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters also had questions about the inclusion of apps as of\nthe last day of the reporting period (i.e., report only existing apps as of the last day of the\nreporting period) or whether apps should be included based upon whether they had registered at\nany point during the reporting period (i.e., report all apps that had been registered during the\nreporting period, even if they are not registered on the last day of the reporting period). A\ncommenter suggested counting the total number of apps active at any point in the reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperiod to appropriately account for onboarding and offboarding activity, whereas a couple of\ncommenters noted that reporting of the app status is not a metric that is measured over a\nreporting period and would be an indication at a point in time at the end of the reporting period.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that the app status (e.g., usage) should include apps based upon\nwhether they had registered at any point in time during the reporting period. We seek to measure\nthe unique number of individuals who used the app during the reporting period (a calendar year)\nand do not want to limit the inclusion to apps that are registered as of the last day of the reporting\nperiod. For apps that were registered during the reporting period and are not registered at the end\nof the reporting period, we would want their status to be calculated and included.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter representing medical professionals recommended that as part\nof this measure, ONC include a metric requiring health app developers to attest to whether they\nadhere to (yes/no) any of the following: (1) Industry-recognized development guidance (e.g.,\nXcertia’s Privacy Guidelines/Privacy Is Good Business: a case for privacy by design in app\ndevelopment); (2) Transparency statements and best practices (e.g., Mobile Health App\nDevelopers: FTC Best Practices/CARIN Alliance Code of Conduct/AMA Privacy Principles);\nand/or (3) A model notice to patients (e.g., ONC’s Model Privacy Notice). The commenter noted\nthat almost all patients want transparency on how apps access, exchange, or use their medical\ninformation, and this would address that need.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their recommendations to include a metric on an\napp developer’s adherence to various privacy and security practices and frameworks. We may\nconsider these recommendations in future rulemaking. We also refer readers to other federal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulations such as Section 5 of the FTC Act,204\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection\nAct (COPPA)205\nand the COPPA Rule,206\nand other industry initiatives207\nsupporting consumers\nin app privacy, security, and transparency.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the “applications supported through certified health IT” measure in §\n170.407(a)(3)(iii). We have revised the proposed measure based on public comments\nreceived. Specific metrics to support this finalized measure are listed below and described\nfurther in the accompanying measure specification located on ONC’s website. We also note\nthat if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a\nrevision to a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification\nwould also be changed to ensure alignment with the revised criterion.\n\n1.

Data collection for the measures and associated metrics will begin during the first phase of\nreporting (which is described later in the preamble).\n\nUse of FHIR in Apps Through Certified Health IT Measure\n\n\nFootnote 204:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/200806/ftca.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 205:\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-105publ277/pdf/PLAW-105publ277.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 206:\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa\n\n\nFootnote 207:\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/mobile-health-apps-interactive-tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23839), we proposed the adoption of the “use of\nFHIR in apps supported by certified API technology” measure in § 170.407(a)(5), which would\ncapture the volume of FHIR resources transferred in response to API calls from apps connected\nto certified API technology by FHIR resource type. We also proposed (88 FR 23839) that the\nFHIR resources transferred be reported by FHIR version used and by US Core Implementation\nGuide version deployed. This measure also proposed requiring developers to report FHIR\nresources transferred in response to calls from two different endpoint types: patient-facing and\nnon-patient-facing, the latter of which would include endpoints that do not facilitate individuals'\naccess (e.g., clinician, payer, or public health endpoints). We explained that this measure\nproposed to require developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to the\n“standardized API for patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) certification criterion\nto report on the number of deployments they support across their customer base, and that\ntogether, these data points would provide insights into the usage of certified APIs by collecting\ndata on the volume of FHIR resources transferred to apps in response to API calls by FHIR\nresource type, type of endpoint, and US Core Implementation Guide used.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23839) the first numerator to be the number of FHIR resources\nreturned/transferred in response to a call to a certified API technology by resource type. We\nproposed the second numerator to be the number of distinct certified API technology\ndeployments (across clients) associated with at least one FHIR resource returned/transferred in\nresponse to a call. We noted that each of the numerators would be stratified (e.g., divide into\nsubsets) by type of endpoint (patient-facing vs. non-patient-facing), by FHIR version, and by US\nCore Implementation Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23839) the denominator to be the total number of distinct certified\nAPI technology deployments (across clients). In addition, we proposed this denominator to be\nstratified by type of endpoint (patient-facing vs. non-patient facing), FHIR version, and US Core\nImplementation Guide. We noted that non-FHIR APIs, such as those represented with\nproprietary standards, are excluded from this measure, including numerators and denominators.\n\nWe refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for a complete listing of the metrics this measure\nwould enable us to calculate (88 FR 23839). As stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, this measure\nwould require that developers report the volume of FHIR resources transferred in response to\ncalls by FHIR version and by US Core Implementation Guide. While Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(g)(10) are required to respond to requests according to FHIR version\nRelease 4, we are aware that there will be newer versions of FHIR supported by newer versions\nof the US Core Implementation Guide. Gaining insights into the frequency in use of US Core\nImplementation Guides will inform ONC of the variability in the implementation of FHIR across\ndevelopers.\n\nWe requested feedback on whether information on both aspects of the measure, FHIR\nversion and US Core Implementation Guide, are necessary as each provides unique insights, or\nwhether focusing on one of these (either FHIR version or US Core Implementation Guide) would\nbe sufficient to understand where the industry is in the implementation of FHIR. We also\nrequested comment on the feasibility of reporting the use of different HL7 FHIR implementation\nguides and FHIR versions, versus being stratified by type of endpoint, type of FHIR resources,\nand by the number of certified API technology deployments (88 FR 23840).\n\nWe also proposed (88 FR 23840) to require developers of certified health IT to whom the\nmeasure would be applicable to report the number of certified API technology deployments (as a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nproxy for organizations that have installed certified API technology) where FHIR resources were\ntransferred in response to a call (relative to the total number of certified API technology\ndeployments). We stated that this information can shed light on whether usage is concentrated\nversus dispersed, indicating the breadth of usage across end users and organizations. However,\ngiven that API deployments may vary across developers, we sought feedback on whether this\nmeasure would be a good proxy for understanding usage across their client bases.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters expressed support for the proposed measure.\n\nTwo commenters, one of which represents ONC’s Health IT Advisory Committee, indicated the\nsupport for metrics that would help inform the future development of interoperability standards,\nincluding versions and variations. Commenters indicated these data would provide use of\nstandards in the field that can shed light on industry-wide readiness for the adoption of standards,\nsuch as those adopted through Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP). One\ncommenter suggested to delay or eliminate the measure. Commenters representing community\nhealthcare associations expressed support for this measure, stating that this measure benefits\ncommunity health centers by measuring the interoperability and seamless data exchange between\nhealthcare applications and exchange partners, which leads to better care coordination and\nimproved population health outcomes.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and believe that these measures\nprovide real-world usage data to help guide and inform the future development of\ninteroperability standards, and therefore we do not plan to eliminate this measure as suggested by\none commenter. While the data for this measure will be collected in the first year of the Insights\nCondition (CY 2026), the first response submission period has been delayed to July, 2027 to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovide more time to implement the measure and reduce burden. More details on the compliance\ndates associated with all the measures can be found in section III.F.3.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters provided qualitative ratings of burden associated\nwith the metrics. One commenter indicated that the first metric (number of FHIR resources\nreturned/ transferred in response to a call to a certified health IT by resource type) would be\nmedium level of effort; whereas the other commenter indicated that first metric would be high\nlevel of effort. Both commenters indicated that the second metric (number of distinct certified\nhealth IT deployments (across clients) associated with at least one FHIR resource\nreturned/transferred in response to a call) would be low level of effort. A couple of other\ncommenters requested additional clarity on whether the first metric intends for developers to\nreport the number of total resources returned for each resource, or the number of requests that\nreturned at least one (1) resource for each resource. For example, if a request returns 100\ndifferent Observations, would that be considered a count of 1 or 100 total resources. Two\ncommenters recommended defining the first metric to be the total number of resources returned.\n\nAnother commenter recommended simplifying the metric by measuring only the number of\nqueries or requests made by patients and by clinicians to measure the actual usage of API\nfunctionality.\n\nA few commenters requested clarifications on whether any FHIR resources supported by\nCEHRT need to be counted. Commenters also recommended for ONC to isolate USCDI v1\nFHIR resources that are within scope of § 170.315(g)(10) for reporting consistency across health\nIT developers. Several commenters recommended that this measure should not require tracking\nof FHIR resources that developers may support beyond USCDI v1, as required by §\n170.315(g)(10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback on the burden associated with the measure. As\ndiscussed earlier in the preamble, to address burden, we have phased the implementation of the\nmeasures starting with a simpler version in the first year and then added the additional\ncomplexity in the subsequent years. Additionally, we have revised the measure to address\nburden. We agree with commenters that for reporting consistency and certain, clear requirements\nthat the FHIR resources reported should align with the criterion § 170.315(g)(10). FHIR\nresources supported by and within the scope of the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion include FHIR\nresources referenced in the US Core IG attributed to and that support USCDI data elements. In\nthis case, as an HTI-1 regulatory baseline, would be version 6.1.0 and v3, respectively, because\ndata collection for this measure will begin after the technical requirements for health IT\ndevelopers to update their certified health IT to these newer standards would have occurred as of\nJanuary 1, 2026. We also note that if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in\nthe future – such as a revision to a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the\nmeasure specification would also be changed to ensure alignment with the revised criterion.\n\nAdditionally, if a health IT developer chooses to use the SVAP to adopt a newer version of\nstandards referenced in § 170.315(g)(10), they will need to report based on the newer versions.\n\nWe also appreciate the requests for clarification on the metrics. Our intent is to measure\nthe adoption and use of FHIR by industry users (e.g., third-party app developers, health IT\ndevelopers, provider organizations). To clarify on whether the metric intends for developers to\nreport the number of total resources returned for each resource, or the number of requests that\nreturned at least one resource for each resource, we have revised the first metric to make it clear\nthat we expect the latter. Additionally, we have removed the phrase, “in response to a call”\nacross the metrics associated with the measure. For example, we have revised the metric from,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber of FHIR resources returned/transferred in response to a call to certified API technology\nby FHIR resource type to the following, number of requests made to certified health IT that\nreturned at least 1 FHIR resource by FHIR resource type. Both the proposed and revised metric\nassess the types of FHIR resources provided by certified health IT in response to a request. A\nrequest made to certified health IT can return a variety of different types and number of FHIR\nresources in response. The proposed metric focused on both the number of resources and types of\nresources returned; the revised metric focuses largely on the types of resources returned rather\nthan the volume of resources returned. This simplified metric will still provide us with the\nnecessary information on the types of resources provided. As noted by commenters, the total\nvolume of FHIR resources returned is more difficult to interpret. The volume of resources could\nbe related to a small number of apps returning a lot of data or many apps returning a little data.\n\nIn contrast, the number of requests that returned at least 1 resource by resource type provides us\ninsights into the “demand” for each resource and is easier to interpret. Measuring queries alone\ndoesn’t provide insight into whether data was shared in response to the query as there may not be\ndata available to return. The goal in this metric is to understand the number of API requests that\nreturn various FHIR resources to gain insight on the resources most commonly exchanged.\n\n*Comments.* A couple commenters requested specific clarification on whether the metric,\nnumber of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) is intended to be the total\nnumber of API deployments active at any time during the reporting period, or the total number\nactive as of the end of the reporting period. The commenters recommended defining it to be the\ntotal number of API deployments active at any time during the reporting period. Another\ncommenter noted a limited situation where an EHR user may have more than one production\ndatabase of a certified solution and requested additional clarification for reporting on the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeasure, anticipating that they would count all deployments of the certified solution regardless\nof the number of clients that represents. A couple commenters provided qualitative ratings of\nburden associated with the metric, indicating that this would be low level of effort.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. Originally, we proposed reporting\nthe number of distinct certified API technology deployments (across clients) during the reporting\nperiod. We clarify that this refers to counting the total number of certified health IT deployments\nactive at any time during the reporting period, not the total number active as of the end of the\nreporting period. We had not intended, nor indicated, that we would be measuring this as of the\nend of the reporting period. We also acknowledge situations where an EHR user may have more\nthan one production database of a certified solution and have revised the measure to count all\ndeployments of the certified solution regardless of the number of clients that represents. The\nmetric now measures the number of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients)\nactive at any time during the reporting period (overall) and by user type (i.e., patient-facing and\nnon-patient-facing).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support for patient-facing versus provider-\nfacing stratification. One commenter expressed concern about reporting in this manner as\nendpoints can serve multiple and broad audiences. For example, the same endpoint could be used\nfor both patients and providers. The same commenter recommended to report based on user type\ninstead of endpoint types.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their input and agree that FHIR endpoints are not\nnecessarily specific to a user type and can serve multiple audiences. Given that endpoints can\nserve both patients and providers (for example) and thus would have to be double counted if that\nwas the case, we have modified the metric to instead report the types of users the endpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nserves. We believe this will simplify reporting. Therefore, we have replaced the term endpoint\ntype with user type. The user type categories are patient-facing and non-patient-facing. We\nbelieve the revision better represents our intention of understanding the user types that are using\nFHIR resources and FHIR APIs.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were generally split on the proposed stratification of reporting\nboth the FHIR version and the US Core Implementation Guide (IG) version. Those in support of\nstratifications indicated that the stratifications provide important distinctions for understanding\nthe use and development of FHIR and is appropriately scoped in alignment with how most health\nIT developers’ certified APIs are deployed. One commenter noted that being able to track IG\nconformance beyond US Core is essential to understanding how the industry is using FHIR and\nthe data being exchanged via FHIR. Additionally, one commenter who supported the\nstratification noted that given continued updating of the US Core IG, future FHIR versions and\nUS Core IG versions may not be synonymous in describing the capabilities of a technology,\nmaking it necessary to stratify by both FHIR version and the US Core IG version. One\ncommenter recommended requiring the reporting of each FHIR resource by IG conformance\nbeyond the US Core IG at the installation level for all health IT developers, including smaller\ndevelopers that certify to FHIR API criteria. Several commenters suggested that ONC remove\nthe stratifications for FHIR version and US Core IG version, noting that FHIR R4 is currently the\nonly relevant version of FHIR base specification version and that, in most cases, health IT\ndevelopers are only conformant to one version of the US Core IG. However, one commenter was\nsupportive of the inclusion of the proposed stratifications for future reporting, as long as ONC\nprovides specific guidance to health IT developers. One commenter noted that stratifying the\nnumber of deployments by the proposed stratification attributes does not make sense unless\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONC’s objective is to measure FHIR APIs or resources transferred and recommended stratifying\ndeployments by the version of the certified health IT product. Another commenter highlighted\nthat the proposed stratifications for FHIR version and US Core IG version would be a high level\nof effort and recommended limiting the measure stratifications to only patient-facing and non-\npatient facing endpoints.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We agree that the stratifications\nprovide real-world data regarding the implementation and use of FHIR and US Core IG. This\ndetailed reporting would help inform our goal of guiding future development of standards and\ninsights on the current implementation and use of standards. We also acknowledge some support\nfor restricting the measure specification to FHIR R4 and to one version of the US Core IG. In\nresponse to comments, we have made changes to metrics related to this measure so that the\nmetrics are simplified and the stratification by FHIR version no longer needs to be reported. We\nalso have developed a phased approach to implement the measure and related metrics over two\nyears. Similar to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule metric, which called for reporting the number of\nFHIR resources returned/transferred in response to calls (also called requests) to a certified\nhealth IT by FHIR resource type, the first metric listed below also assesses the types of FHIR\nresources provided by certified health IT in response to a request. The revised metric no longer\nrequires the number of FHIR resources, but instead requires counting the number of requests\nwhere at least one FHIR resource was provided. As described earlier, we sought to simplify this\nmetric in response to comments and thus scaled back this metric to the number of requests made\nthat returned at least 1 FHIR resource by resource type. For the second metric listed below, we\nhave simply embedded the original stratification—by user type (which replaced type of\nendpoint)—within the metric; rather than listing the stratifications separately. The third metric\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiffers from the second metric because it asks about the number of distinct certified health IT\ndeployments (across clients) overall and by user type, and is not limited to those certified health\nIT deployments which were associated with at least one FHIR resource returned or transferred.\n\nWe note that for the third metric, the word “total” was removed from the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\nmeasure as there is no substantive difference between “total number” of distinct certified health\nIT deployments (across clients) by user type (i.e., patient-facing and non-patient-facing) and\n“number” of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) by user type (i.e., patient-\nfacing and non-patient-facing) and we seek to create consistency across the metrics.\n\nAs noted earlier, to reduce burden, we have dropped the stratification by FHIR version\nbut have kept the US Core IG version stratification. Given that we are aligning the reporting of\nFHIR resources to those supported by the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion and health IT developers\nwill also report on the US Core IG version which aligns with the specific version of FHIR, we do\nnot also need to separately obtain information on FHIR version. The metrics indicate the number\nof distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) associated with at least one FHIR\nresource returned by US Core IG version(s). Together, the phasing of the reporting requirements\nand simplifying metrics (including removing the FHIR version stratification) will lower the\ninitial reporting burden for health IT developers, as well as provide health IT developers\nadditional time to develop the infrastructure necessary to report on the more advanced\nstratification (US Core IG versions) which would have valuable insights.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the measure as “use of FHIR in apps through certified health IT” in §\n170.407(a)(3)(iv). We have revised the proposed measure based on public comments received.\n\nSpecific metrics to support this finalized measure are listed below and described further in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccompanying measure specification located on ONC’s website. As noted earlier, if regulatory\nbaselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a revision to a criterion\nthrough notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification would also be changed to\nensure alignment with the revised criterion. The reporting period for the measure and related\nmetrics below consists of one calendar year. Data collection for the measures and associated\nmetrics will begin during the first and second phases of reporting (which is further described\nlater in the preamble):\nIn the first year (where responses will be due July 2027, and annually thereafter), we\nrequire developers to report the:\n• Number of requests made to distinct certified health IT deployments that returned at least\n1 FHIR resource by FHIR resource type.\n\n• Number of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) associated with at\nleast one FHIR resource returned, overall and by user type (e.g., patient-facing and non-\npatient- facing).\n\n• Number of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) active at any time\nduring the reporting period, overall and by user type (i.e., patient-facing and non-patient-\nfacing).\n\nIn year 2, in addition to what is required in year 1, we require developers to report the metrics\nbelow. These metrics will be due July 2028 (and annually thereafter):\n• Number of distinct certified health IT deployments (across clients) associated with at\nleast one FHIR resource returned by US Core Implementation Guide version.\n\nUse of FHIR Bulk Data Access Through Certified Health IT Measure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23840) to adopt the “use of FHIR bulk data access through certified\nhealth IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(6), which would measure the number of bulk data downloads\ncompleted through certified health IT relative to the number of certified health IT deployments\nor installations. Specifically, we stated that this measure would provide information on how\ncertified health IT is being used to perform “read” services for a specified patient population\nusing the HL7 FHIR® Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR) V1.0.1 standard. A developer of certified\nhealth IT with Health IT Modules certified to the “standardized API for patient and population\nservices” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) certification criterion would be required to report under this\nproposed measure.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23840) the first numerator to be the number of data/download\nrequests completed during the reporting period using certified health IT certified to the\n“standardized API for patient and population services” (§ 170.315(g)(10)) in response to a bulk\ndata download request to export all data for patients within a specified group. We proposed (88\nFR 23840) the second numerator to be the number of distinct certified health IT deployments or\ninstallations certified to the “standardized API for patient and population services” (§\n170.315(g)(10)) (across clients) that successfully completed at least one bulk data download\nrequest during the reporting period.\n\nWe proposed the denominator (88 FR 23840) to be the total number of distinct certified\nhealth IT deployments or installations (across clients). We requested comment on whether\nadditional stratifications would provide valuable insights, what additional data developers of\ncertified health IT are collecting, and what effort developers of certified health IT are devoting to\ncollecting additional data such as: (1) intended use case (e.g., population analytics, reporting,\nresearch); (2) entity calling the API (e.g., healthcare organization, payer, public health agency);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand (3) automated queries (refreshing the data at certain intervals) versus ad hoc queries. For\nfuture measure development, we requested comment on whether it is possible to collect\ninformation on the number of authorized users calling a bulk FHIR API, the level of effort\nrequired to collect this information, and whether it would provide valuable insights.\n\nWe also noted and clarified that non-standard or proprietary resources (e.g., non-FHIR\nbased) transferred would be excluded from this measure, and that the proposed data for this\nmeasure would not include patient-facing applications, as individual patients only have the right\nto access their own records or records of patients to whom they are a personal representative.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters were supportive of the proposed measure. Two\ncommunity healthcare associations supported this measure, expressing that this measure benefits\ncommunity health centers by monitoring the ability to leverage comprehensive data for\npopulation health management and analytics, which will guide public health and population\nhealth initiatives. One commenter strongly recommended including at least one metric to track\nthe real-world performance of current HL7/SMART FHIR bulk data implementations. One\ncommenter expressed an opinion that the burdens of data capture for this reporting purpose\noutweighed the value of additional stratification and suggested starting with a “core” measure\nand layering on additional stratifications using a phased approach. The commenter noted that\nwhile reporting is feasible, it may require development to capture a specific countable event for\nreporting purposes. A couple of commenters also provided qualitative ratings of burden\nassociated with the measure. One commenter indicated that the first numerator would be medium\nlevel of effort; whereas the other commenter indicated that the first numerator would be low\nlevel of effort. Both commenters indicated that the second numerator would be low level of\neffort, and that the denominator would be low level of effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by commenters as well as the desire to\nphase in the measure, providing more time to implement the measure which, overall, has\nrelatively lower burden. We also appreciate the suggestion to include at least one reporting\nmetric to track the real-world performance of current bulk FHIR implementations. However, this\nwill require additional research to determine whether the reporting metric should be included for\nfuture rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested additional clarity on whether the specification\nof “operationalized as [FHIR ServerBase]/Group/[groupid]/$export” is used for both numerators\nin this measure. Additionally, commenters expressed confusion on whether the count for both\nmeasures is defined as the number of group export completed or the number of group export\ncompleted, accessed, and downloaded. The commenters recommended to count the number of\ncompleted requests, regardless of whether they are subsequently accessed and downloaded by\nthe requestor. One commenter noted that their health IT solution cannot determine when a user\nhas downloaded all queried and retrieved data files. One commenter requested additional clarity\non the difference between “requests completed” in the first numerator and “successfully\ncompleted” in the second numerator for a bulk data download request. Another commenter\nsuggested defining “complete” as when the Bulk Data Status Request reports a status of\ncomplete (i.e., the timepoint when the user may begin downloading files). One commenter\nrequested additional clarity on how “rate” will be measured under the second numerator. One\ncommenter requested clarification regarding the requirement to include API-enable “read”\nservices for multiple patients across all endpoints regardless of whether it is publicly available or\nnot and specifically whether non-patient-facing endpoints are to be counted, since regulations\nonly require patient-facing URL endpoints to be published. One commenter suggested for ONC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto collect data on bulk FHIR data queries by cohort type (e.g., research, financial operations, care\nmanagement, public health, electronic case reporting).\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. To clarify, the bulk data download\nrequest using certified health IT to export all data for patients within a specified group will be\noperationalized as “[FHIR ServerBase]/Group/[groupid]/$export” for the metrics associated with\nthis measure. We agree with commenters that the measure should focus on the number of\ncompleted requests, regardless of whether they are subsequently accessed and downloaded by\nthe requestor and have revised the wording of both metrics to reflect this change. Thus,\n“completed” is defined as when the Bulk Data Status Request reports a status of complete (i.e.,\nthe timepoint when the user may begin downloading files). We believe there is not a substantive\ndifference between “successfully completed” and “completed,” and to keep consistency between\nthese metrics, we have removed the proposed term “successfully” from both metrics. We have\nalso replaced the term “data/download” to “bulk data access” for consistency with the title of the\nmeasure.\n\nWe have removed “expected metrics” that we had originally listed in the measure\nspecifications sheets accompanying the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, such as the rate of bulk data\ndownload requests. To clarify, it is ONC that will be responsible for calculating derived statistics\nbased upon the metrics and data the developers report. We will also determine how calculated\nmetrics will be aggregated and reported (whether at the national, developer, and/or product level)\nonce we receive the data. How the data is presented will depend in part upon the completeness\nand quality of the data received.\n\nThese metrics apply to API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients where the\nnumber reported should reflect the “read” access queries that used the population services\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncapabilities in § 170.315(g)(10) (e.g., the FHIR Bulk Data Access IG). Given that bulk FHIR is\nlikely primarily for non-patient facing use cases, it should not be limited to patient-facing\nendpoints; it needs to include “all” endpoints and use cases. Furthermore, these metrics are\nunrelated to the API Condition of Certification requirements for publishing patient-facing\nendpoints, which supports patient access to their data using 3rd party apps and not related to\nBulk FHIR. To reiterate, the metrics should reflect activity across all endpoints regardless of\nwhether publicly available or not and type of endpoint user. The endpoints included should not\nbe limited to those only used by patients. This is important as we seek insight on bulk data usage\nvolume independent of user type and have developed a measure in a manner that does not\ndifferentiate between public and private APIs. In addition, we note that the measure applies to\nFHIR Bulk Data requests for FHIR resources that within the scope of § 170.315(g)(10) as\ndiscussed in more detail in the responses to comments in the previous measure above.\n\nWe appreciate the interest expressed in a reporting metrics that measure the adoption and\nconformance of FHIR Bulk Data APIs by cohort type or use case and may explore the feasibility\nof this in the future.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended ONC to align the denominator to the “use of\nFHIR in apps supported by certified API technology” measure. Another commenter requested\nclarification on whether the denominator is intended to be the total number of API deployments\nactive at any time during the reporting period, or the total number active as of the end of the\nreporting period and recommended to define the denominator to be the total number of API\ndeployments active at any time during the reporting period. Another commenter noted a limited\nsituation where an EHR user may have more than one production database of a certified solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand recommended to count all deployments of the certified solution regardless of the number of\nclients that represents.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. In response to comments, we have\nreviewed the metrics (previously referred to as denominators) for the two measures (“use of\nFHIR in apps supported by certified API technology” [finalized as “use of FHIR in apps through\ncertified health IT”] and “use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT”). We concur\nthat these metrics should be consistent with each other and measure the number of distinct health\nIT deployments (across clients) active at any time during the reporting period. Therefore, we will\nuse the metric from the “use of FHIR in apps through certified health IT” measure for calculating\nany derived statistics.\n\nWe acknowledge situations where an EHR user may have more than one production\ndatabase of a certified solution and clarify that this measure counts all deployments of the\ncertified solution regardless of the number of clients that represents.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the “use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT” measure\nin § 170.407(a)(3)(v). We have revised the proposed measure based on public comments\nreceived. Specific metrics to support this finalized measure are listed below and described further\nin the accompanying measure specification located on ONC’s website. We also note that if\nregulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a revision to a\ncriterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification would also be\nchanged to ensure alignment with the revised criterion:\n1. Number of bulk data access requests completed (across clients) to export all data\nrequested for patients within a specified group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Number of distinct deployments of the certified health IT deployments (across clients)\nthat completed at least one bulk data access request.\n\nThe reporting period for the measure and related metrics above consists of one calendar year.\n\nData collection for the measures and associated metrics will begin during the second phase of\nreporting (which is described later in the preamble).\n\nElectronic Health Information Export through Certified Health IT Measure\nWe proposed (88 FR 23841) to adopt the “electronic health information export through\ncertified health IT” measure in § 170.407(a)(7) which would capture the use of certified health\nIT to export single patient and patient population EHI. A developer of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to the “electronic health information (EHI) export” (§\n170.315(b)(10)) certification criterion will be required to report data under this proposed\nmeasure.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23841) a count for this measure (rather than a numerator and\ndenominator) that includes the number of full data EHI exports requests processed during the\nreporting period and reported by the following subgroups: (1) by a single patient EHI export; and\n(2) by patient population EHI export. We also proposed (88 FR 23841) reports should include a\n“yes” or “no” attestation for enabling direct-to-individual EHI exports. We stated that the\nproposed measure would report on the number of EHI export requests processed by a health IT\ndeveloper and provide insights on the implementation of the EHI export capability. We refer\nreaders to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for detailed background on the measure (88 FR 23841).\n\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23841), we also noted in the ONC Cures\nAct Final Rule (85 FR 25695) that the EHI Export certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoes not require “direct-to-patient” functionality in order for a developer to demonstrate\nconformance to the criterion. However, we did not preclude this functionality, and we sought\ncomment as part of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule on whether any products support direct-to-patient\nEHI Export functionality to inform future policy decisions. We also sought comment on whether\nit would be valuable for this measure to be reported by “use case” for why the data was exported\n(e.g., moving to another certified health IT system, use for a population health tool), and how\nfeasible would it be for impacted developers to report in this manner. Lastly, we sought comment\non whether it would be valuable, and if so, how valuable, for this measure to include reports\nregarding the types of recipients (e.g., patients, organizations) of the exported data, and how\nfeasible would it be for impacted developers to report this data in this manner.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters expressed support of this measure with numerous\ncommenters indicating that this measure is feasible as written and that the burden to report this\nmeasure is low. One commenter recommended delay or removal of this measure though did not\nprovide a rationale. One commenter recommended ONC to consider how patient EHI can be best\nprotected upon export, given concern regarding inappropriate use of information. Another\ncommenter recommended creation of patient-facing and provider-facing educational materials in\nsupport of this measure. One commenter asked for clarity regarding the term “processed” and\nwhether it intended to indicate started or completed. One commenter disagreed with an\nattestation reporting requirement for functionality that is not required. One commenter who\nsupported attestation asked for clarification on “direct-to-individual,” specifying whether the\ncapability should be performed by the patient without any health care provider involvement. One\ncommenter indicated that capturing and reporting “use case” does not provide value and did not\nsupport this capability while requesting that the “use case” and “recipient” types be standardized\n\n\n\n\n\n\nacross all health IT developers. One commenter requested clarification of the definition of a “full\ndata export” and whether a subset of data in a timeframe or based upon patient request would\nconstitute “full data” in the context of this measure.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by numerous commenters, as well as the\nthoughtful feedback and suggestions for this measure. However, in our overall efforts to reduce\nburden, we have not adopted the “electronic health information export through certified health\nIT” measure. We plan to revisit the EHI export capability in § 170.315(b)(10) as a potential\nmeasure when this capability is more widely deployed and may propose measures that provide\nmore valuable insights in future rulemaking.\n\nMeasurement Area: Public Health Information Exchange\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23841), we discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic\nexposed many gaps and challenges in the nation’s public health infrastructure, including a need\nfor more accurate and timely data, increased electronic exchange of patient health information\nbetween health care providers and public health agencies, and greater support for vulnerable\nindividuals and communities disproportionally affected by the pandemic.<sup>208</sup>\nTherefore, in §\n170.407(a)(8) and (9), we proposed two measures within the “public health information\nexchange” area for reporting health care providers’ use of certified health IT to exchange data\nwith an immunization information system (IIS) (88 FR 23841). We stated that the insights from\nthese measures could help ONC (and HHS more broadly) assess the public health capabilities of\ncertified health IT, and that we believe that more detailed measurement of health care providers’\n\n\nFootnote 208:\nDixon BE, Rahurkar S, Apathy NC. Interoperability and health information exchange for public health. In Public\nhealth Informatics and information systems 2020 (pp. 307-324). Springer, Cham. https://doi-\norg.ezproxyhhs.nihlibrary.nih.gov/10.1007/978-3-030-41215-9_18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nability to use certified health IT to successfully exchange health information with public health\nagencies would provide critical data for pandemic response and other public health emergencies.\n\n*Comments.* We received broad support for the adoption of two measures within the\n“public health information exchange” area. These commenters also encouraged additional public\nhealth information exchange measures in future iterations of the Insights Conditions, such as for\ncancer reporting, electronic case reporting, syndromic surveillance, and electronic laboratory\nreporting, along with an estimated timeframe for the development and implementation of these\nmeasures. A couple of commenters recommended that ONC align future public health\ninformation exchange measures with CMS measures. One commenter expressed support and\nrequested clarity on how the information will be used to evaluate performance, or inform policy\nor other decision making. Another commenter requested ONC to make aggregate responses\navailable to the public.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and agree that the goal is to help\nmeasure progress related to certified health IT’s ability to support public health information\nexchange. This data will provide “insights” into health care providers’ use of certified health IT\nfor public health information exchange that can guide policy efforts to improve these efforts\nthrough initiatives such as the CDC Data Modernization Initiative. In this iteration of the Insights\nCondition, we have focused on immunization related exchange. However, in future rounds, we\nplan to consider other areas of public health information exchange to include as part of the\nProgram, working with CMS, CDC, and other federal partners as necessary to ensure alignment\nof measures. As noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23847), we plan to make the measures\nand the required data documentation reported by health IT developers available to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern on the level of burden required by health\nIT developers to obtain the necessary data for each measure and recommended requiring only\noverall administration submission numbers. Another commenter opined on whether engaging\nwith public health agencies to generate some meaningful data might be less burdensome on\nvendors and their users and may paint a more complete picture of the situation.\n\n*Response.* We understand the concerns expressed regarding burden and recognize that\nthese measures may require discrete effort on the part of health IT developers. We appreciate the\nfeedback from commenters and made revisions to reduce the burden associated with creating and\nreporting these measures which are further detailed below in this section of the preamble. This\nincludes removing our proposal to report by age for the “immunization history and forecast”\nmeasure, providing additional time for implementation by phasing in the measures over two\nyears, and phasing in complex aspects of the requirements (e.g., reporting by age and/or IIS)\nover a span of three years.\n\nData from the measures we have finalized in this final rule will provide insights into the\nlevel of exchange between certified health IT systems and IISs, to identify opportunities to\naddress gaps or lags discovered. With regards to public health entities having similar measures,\nthe CDC’s Immunization Integration Program (IIP) Testing and Recognition initiative, an ONC\napproved alternative testing method for the “transmission to immunization registries” (§\n170.315(f)(1)) criterion, share some similarities to the measures we had proposed and\nsubsequently finalized. We seek to build upon the IIP by expanding the scope of their measures,\nwhich cover a sample of jurisdictions, to include all jurisdictions. This expansion would provide\nnational level insights. In contrast to the IIP, ONC’s electronic submission of immunization\nadministrations to IISs shall be reported by age categories, which will help interpret the data as\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIISs are more likely to have mandates for reporting vaccinations given to children and\nadolescents compared to adults. We also have a unique measure in comparison to the IIP, which\nmeasures the total number of vaccine administrations. Developers that participate in the IIP\nshould gain experience that will help them with reporting for the Insights Condition. Regarding\nthe concern whether public health jurisdictions may serve as an alternative source for this data,\nwhile an IIS serves as a valuable source to understand vaccination coverage using unique patient\nrecords and vaccination histories, not all jurisdictions have access to or the ability to produce the\nmeasures that we proposed. Jurisdictions with high performing IISs and staff to support them are\nmore likely to have these data and use them to improve data quality. However, not all\njurisdictions have access to these data. Thus, the measures address an important gap in\ninformation that can help improve interoperability between health care providers and\njurisdictional IISs.\n\nImmunization Administrations Electronically Submitted to Immunization Information\nSystems through Certified Health IT Measure\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23842), we proposed to adopt in § 170.407(a)(8) a\npublic health exchange measure that would report on the volume of immunization\nadministrations electronically submitted to an immunization information system through\ncertified health IT. We stated that this measure would capture the use of certified health IT to\nsend information on vaccination and immunization administrations to an IIS. Specifically, the\nproposed “immunization administrations electronically submitted to an immunization\ninformation system through certified health IT” measure would require developers of certified\nhealth IT with Health IT Modules certified to the “transmission to immunization registries” (§\n170.315(f)(1)) criterion to report on the number of records of immunizations administered that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere sent electronically to an IIS during the reporting period. We proposed that developers of\ncertified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(1) that do not have users that\nadministered immunizations during the reporting period would attest that they are unable to\nreport on this measure.\n\nWe stated that the intent of the measure is to ensure that ONC has the information\nnecessary to assess whether Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(1) are being used to\nsupport electronically sending vaccination information data to IISs, which has proven to be\ncritical to public health preparedness and response.\n\nFor the numerator, we proposed (88 FR 23842) developers of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(1) report the number of immunization\nadministrations from which the information was electronically submitted to an IIS successfully\nduring the reporting period by IIS and age group. We proposed (88 FR 23842) that the numerator\nand denominator counts would be reported overall (across IIS and age subgroups) and by the\nfollowing subgroups: (1) number of administrations by IIS; and (2) number of administrations by\nIIS and age group (adults (18 years and over) and children/infants (17 years and under)). We\ndefined a successful submission to an IIS would be the total number of messages submitted\nminus acknowledgments with errors (2.5.1, severity level of E). We stated that we believe this\ndefinition will avoid limitations from IIS jurisdictions that do not send HL7 Acknowledgment\nmessages (ACKs) for this measure. Given that, we proposed that ACKs with an error (severity\nlevel of E)<sup>209</sup>\nwould not be counted, and we sought comment on whether ACKs with a warning\n(severity level W) should still be counted in the numerator. We also sought comment (88 FR\n\n\nFootnote 209:\nHL7 Version 2.5.1. Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging. Release 1.5. October 1, 2014.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/technical-guidance/downloads/hl7guide-1-5-2014-11.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23842) on whether the number of immunizations administered can be linked to immunizations\nsubmitted to the IIS, effectively creating a subset of the numerator (immunizations\nadministered). Additionally, we sought comment (88 FR 23842) on whether a successful\nsubmission should be counted if a health care provider is able to successfully submit to at least\none registry, as opposed to all the registries they submitted to (e.g., health care providers who\noperate in multiple states sending data for the same administration to multiple IISs). In the\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23842), we also considered whether “replays,” which involve\nresubmitting administrations until they are successfully submitted, qualify as a successful\nsubmission. In other words, we sought comment on whether successful submissions should be\nlimited to the first attempt to submit.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23842) the denominator for this measure to be the number of\nimmunizations administered during the reporting period, and that the denominator be stratified\nby the following subgroups: (1) number of administrations reported to each IIS; and (2) number\nof administrations reported to each IIS, by age group (adults (18 years and over) and\nchildren/infants (17 years and under)). Given the variation in immunization reporting\nrequirements and patient consent by state or jurisdiction, reporting of administrations by IIS is\ncritical to interpreting the data correctly, therefore we proposed this measure to be stratified by\nIIS. In addition, given that immunization requirements are different for children and adults, we\nproposed stratifying by age group as well. To further inform public health exchange efforts, we\nalso sought comment (88 FR 23842) on whether adolescents/infants should be further stratified\nby age, and by what age limits. For providers who operate in multiple states, and thus would be\nsending data for the same administration to multiple IIS, we sought comment (88 FR 23842) on\nwhether a successful submission should be counted if a provider is able to successfully submit to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat least one registry versus all the registries to which the provider submitted. As stated in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23843), the data collected for this measure would enable ONC to\ncalculate the percent of immunizations administered where the information was electronically\nsubmitted to an IIS.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the proposed “immunization\nadministrations electronically submitted to an immunization information system through\ncertified health IT” measure, stating that these reporting metrics will encourage providers to\ninstitute proven best practices for obtaining consent and report vaccinations where consent is\nreceived. Commenters also stated that organizations using certified health IT would benefit, as it\nwould provide aggregate numbers and user-friendly reports, and help detect connectivity\ninterruptions, as well as help federal agencies, public health agencies, and health IT developers\nbetter understand the extent to which health IT is exchanging data with an IIS. A commenter also\nstated that this would provide real-time and comprehensive data on immunization coverage,\nfacilitating targeted interventions, and contribute to overall population health protection. One\ncommenter recommended that ONC and CMS continue collaborating to consider how their\nmeasures can be analyzed and interpreted in tandem to answer questions about data exchange, as\nwell as to collaborate on additional future public health measures.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of the measure and agree with the\npotential benefits of a measure that assesses how Health IT Modules certified to the\n“transmission to immunization registries” (§ 170.315(f)(1)) criterion are being used to support\nelectronically sending vaccination information data to an IIS. This criterion has proven to be\ncritical to public health preparedness and response. We believe this measure can provide insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeyond current physician surveys limited by small sample size that do not provide information\non actual usage of functionality that supports electronically sending vaccination data to an IIS.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern regarding the burden related to this\nmeasure. Commenters representing health IT developers recommended we delay the patient age\nand IIS stratifications from the measure and proceed with the overall administration submission\nnumbers, due to the high burden level rating for these stratifications. Other commenters\nexpressed support on the age group stratifications as proposed and did not believe any additional\nage group stratifications were necessary, stating that it may add unnecessary complexity to the\nmeasure. One commenter suggested eliminating the measure. Another commenter stated that\nsince API access can be measured at either endpoint of the transaction, ONC should request this\ninformation from the IIS rather than from providers. One commenter recommended to lessen the\nburden, ONC could provide standardized value sets for use by all vendors in the counting of\nmandatory immunization requirements across the nation, however, the commenter conveyed that\nthe necessary work for this effort would outweigh the benefits.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed on the stratifications and have finalized\nthe IIS and age stratifications as proposed. The IIS stratification is critical for assessing both the\ninteroperability and exchange of information between certified health IT and immunization\ninformation systems as well as the extent to which health care providers are engaging in\nimmunization reporting. Examining these data by IIS will allow us to monitor the evolving state\nof immunization data exchange as efforts are made to modernize public health information\ntechnology. Additionally, public health jurisdictions will obtain data which they currently don’t\nhave access to, and understand the extent to which certified health technology is used for\nimmunization reporting. Therefore, we have kept the proposed IIS stratification. We also believe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstratifying by age is important for the purpose of interpreting the results. Public health\njurisdictions commonly mandate immunization reporting for children, but do so less for adults.\n\nWithout the age stratification, it would be difficult to assess whether high or low rates of\nsubmission were due to differences in requirements related to adults versus children or another\nreason (e.g., issues with exchange between certified health IT systems and IIS). Thus, we kept\nthe proposed stratification for age to provide insights on trends related to reporting\nimmunizations for adults and children.\n\nHowever, we also understand and acknowledge the concerns expressed for the resources\nrequired to develop stratifications for this measure. In response to commenters, we have updated\nthe implementation timelines to provide additional time for compliance by phasing in the\nstratifications (IIS and age) by an additional year and refer readers to the Insights Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification section (III.F.3) for a detailed discussion of timelines and the\nphasing in of measures in this final rule.\n\nWe appreciate the comment inquiring about the potential role to leverage public health\nAPIs to support measurement. The measure focuses on data submitted via certified health IT and\nnote that the suggested use of public health APIs for measurement is currently outside the scope\nof the Program, and not all public health entities may have APIs to support this type of\nmeasurement.\n\nWe also clarify that the measure does not require logic customized to individual\njurisdiction reporting mandates. As noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23842) the number\nof immunizations transmitted to an IIS will reflect the provider organization’s existing practices\nto transmit this data in accordance with jurisdictional requirements. Therefore, we do not see an\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimmediate need to create a value set that would express those requirements. However, we may\nexplore this suggestion in the future rulemaking to reduce burden.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on whether the age to be used for\ncounting purposes is the age at the time of immunization administration or at the time the\ninformation is transmitted to the IIS. Another commenter recommended that adolescent data\nextend through age 18, rather than to age 18, to align with the Vaccines for Children program\nage ranges, as well as requested expectations for jurisdictions that either have limited adult\nreporting or have an adult “opt-in” model, as these jurisdictions will likely have a low level of\nreporting.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. In response to comments, we have\nmodified the age categories for clarity. In alignment with the CDC’s Vaccines for Children\nprogram, we have modified the age stratifications to the following two categories: (1)\nimmunizations administered for patients 18 years of age and younger (children and adolescents)\nand (2) immunizations administered for patients 19 years of age and older (adults). We are aware\nthat age-related requirements vary by jurisdiction but for the purposes of standardization and\nease of reporting, we have opted to align our requirements with the CDC’s Vaccine for Children\nProgram. Patients in the measure’s metrics should be counted based on age at time of\nadministration. We acknowledge that a relatively small number of patients may fall into separate\ncounts if the date of immunization is close to the end of the reporting period, but we expect that\nthese instances should not significantly impact the metrics calculated.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that timeliness should be added to this\nmeasure’s numerator and stratify the measure by the definition of “timely” to be less than or\nequal to 24 hours to provide health IT developers, providers, and public health agencies with\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsights into how rapidly immunization data is being shared with IIS registries and accessed by\nhealth agencies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the recommendation to factor timeliness and agree this plays a\ncritical role in data quality and utility. We may consider this aspect for future potential measure\nenhancements as we seek to appropriately factor variation in provider workflow and\njurisdictional reporting requirements.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on whether a message is a failure or\nsuccess if the initial message for a vaccination administration is successful, but the\nadministration is updated in the EHR, and the update message fails. One commenter suggested\ncollecting how many submissions needed to be repeated. Several commenters stated that replays\nshould qualify as a successful submission since there are scenarios that could create a submission\nfailure at no fault of the developer, and immunization submitters should be recognized for\nsuccessful error remediation. One commenter recommended that “replays” are considered\nsuccessful submissions, but each replay of a single immunization administration should not be\ncounted as a separate submission, as overcounting may result in inflating the numerator of the\nmeasure.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. The intent of the measure is to\nunderstand the process of submitting immunization to an IIS and efforts by health care providers\nto successfully submit immunization administrations to an IIS. While the process and effort can\ninvolve resolving message failures, the measure counts the number of immunizations\nadministered that are submitted to the IIS, rather than the number of attempts to successfully\ntransmit the immunization. With this in mind, we clarify that, in the instance where the initial\nmessage for an immunization administration is successful and a subsequent update in the EHR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhas an update message that fails, the metrics for the number of immunizations administered that\nwere electronically submitted successfully to IISs overall, by age category and IIS should reflect\nthe final status of the immunization submission to the IIS. There should not be two counts in\nthese metrics for the successful initial message and the subsequent failure update message. We\nexpect that the shift to calendar year reporting will minimize instances where the final status of\nsuccessful vaccine submissions would not be available to count in the measure. Therefore, the\nmeasure will count the status of the final submission at the time the reporting period ends in\nthese metrics, rather than counting each attempt separately. This applies to replays, which should\nnot count as separate submission attempts in these metrics. Although this measure will not\nseparately document the number of replays, we agree with commenters who supported counting\nreplays and multiple messages as separate attempts to successfully submit an immunization and\nmay consider future measures that would document the level of effort taken for successful error\nremediation. We encourage those reporting on this measure to include counts of replays in the\nsupplemental documentation as this could shape future iterations of this measure.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support that those acknowledgements with a\nseverity level of “E” be considered a failure for purposes of the measure’s numerator. The\ncommenters added that acknowledgements with the severity level “W” should not be considered\na failure, given that they were likely successfully processed by the IIS and their data accepted by\nthe immunization program. However, another commenter noted the possibility that including\nacknowledgements with the severity level “W” could inflate the measure and make interpretation\nchallenging. One commenter requested confirmation that only “E” responses should be\nsubtracted from the success acknowledgements and noted it would be helpful for ONC to define\nthe concepts of error and warning responses in the context of this measure. One commenter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstated that there is variation on how the error status of level “E” is used in practices, noting that\nthis would likely make the aggregated data ONC proposes to report less than accurate, and\nrequested clarification on whether the purpose of the use of error and warning messages in this\ncontext is to assess whether immunization registries are functioning effectively. One commenter\nrecommended that the successful submission definition be revised to reflect that no negative\nacknowledgement is a successful submission, until an alternative mechanism is used to route\nacknowledgements from the registry back to the EHR.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We appreciate the comment that\nacknowledgements from IIS with a severity level of “W” could potentially inflate the measure\nand acknowledges the variation on how “E” is used in practices. We intend to collaborate with\nthe community to monitor how these instances may impact the interpretation of the measure and\ndetermine if it should be revised in the future. We also appreciate commenters requesting\nconfirmation that the measure should consider acknowledgements with a severity level of “E” as\na failed message. We confirm that this is the only severity level for messages that should be\nexcluded from the measure’s metrics for the number of immunizations administered that were\nelectronically submitted successfully to IISs overall, by age category and IIS. We thank\ncommenters for their consideration of the implications for error status level “E.” We confirm that\nsuccessful submissions are defined as the total number of messages submitted to an IIS, minus\nacknowledgements with errors (2.5.1, severity level “E”). For these metrics, we clarify that not\nall immunizations that are administered and submitted during the period may receive a status of\nthe submission acknowledgement message from an IIS during the reporting period. In this\nsituation (where an acknowledgement from an IIS is not received), the immunization submission\nshould be counted as successful. We request that health IT developers report the number of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubmissions that did not receive acknowledgement in the supplemental documentation so these\nmetrics can be refined in the future if needed.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters stated that a successful submission should be counted if a\nhealth care provider is able to successfully submit to all of the registries to which the provider\nsubmitted, including submissions to more than one IIS, stating that the inflation of the count\nwould be minimal.\n\n*Response.* In response to comments, the metrics for the number of immunizations\nadministered that were electronically submitted successfully to IISs overall, by age category and\nIIS, indicate that each successful submission to an IIS to which a provider submits\nimmunizations should be included and counted as a successful submission. Thus, an\nimmunization that is successfully submitted to more than one IIS would be counted the number\nof times it was successfully submitted to each IIS. When the stratified metric is reported by IIS,\nthe count inflation should not be an issue as the multiple submissions would be separated by IIS.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification on the denominator counts. One\ncommenter requested clarification on whether a patient who opts out of having certain\nadministered immunizations submitted to the IIS should be included in the denominator, as well\nas if an immunization is ordered but refused by the patient. The same commenter also requested\nclarification on whether the denominator includes administered vaccines from provider\norganizations that do not yet have connectivity in place to an IIS for reporting administered\nvaccines. One commenter recommended that the denominator exclude the number of patients\nwho have opted out of vaccination reporting to capture more accurately the proportion of\nimmunization administrations electronically submitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their request for clarification. We clarify that the\nmeasure focuses on counting immunizations administered and submitted. Patients who have been\nadministered an immunization and opt out of submitting their data to an IIS should count in the\nmetrics for the number of immunizations administered overall, by age category and IIS, but not\nthe metrics for the number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted\nsuccessfully to IISs overall, by age category and IIS. To ease burden and given the assumption\nthat the number of opt-outs are relatively low, we believe it is sufficient to include them.\n\nHowever, there may be value in counting the number of opt-outs in the future to determine\nwhether it is worth removing them (or separately report on these). Patients who decline an\nimmunization will not appear in the metrics for the number of immunizations administered\noverall, by age category and IIS, and there will be no immunization submission to count in the\nmetrics for the number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted\nsuccessfully to IISs overall, by age category and IIS. We also clarify that immunizations\nadministered at health care provider organizations that have certified health IT eligible for\nreporting but do not have an existing, active connection to electronically submit immunizations\nto an IIS will count in the metrics for the number of immunizations administered overall, by age\ncategory and IIS, while there will be no count in the metrics for the number of immunizations\nadministered that were electronically submitted successfully to IISs overall, by age category and\nIIS. This approach will contribute to insights on the number of immunizations that could be\nelectronically submitted to reduce provider burden associated with manual submission.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that stratifying the denominator (number of\nimmunizations administered within the reporting period) by IIS does not make sense since an IIS\nis not identified with an immunization administration. One commenter expressed concern stating\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat an EHR is unlikely to know of administrations reported to an IIS through a web portal or\nalternate mechanism and recommended that the measure should instead be out of the total\nnumber of doses administered how many doses were submitted electronically, and of those\nelectronically submitted, how many were successful. A couple of commenters recommended that\nthe number of administrations reported to each IIS should be revised to number of\nadministrations valid for reporting to each IIS to ensure that the count of doses sent\nelectronically only include those doses tagged as newly administered. Another commenter\nrequested guidance on how doses should be counted in the metrics if two EHR systems merge,\nand another requested clarification on how data submitted from a non-traditional location should\nbe counted.\n\n*Response.* The metrics for the number of immunizations administered overall, age\ncategory and IIS, is stratified or reported by IIS because we seek to assess the extent to which an\nIIS is receiving data on immunizations administered. While the location of the patient typically\ndetermines the IIS to which vaccine administration information is sent, given that it is unclear as\nto which data sources may be easily accessible to make this determination, we provide two\noptions regarding how best to select the IIS for those vaccines that are administered but not\nsubmitted: (1) based upon the primary IIS used by the client site; or (2) based upon the\njurisdiction associated with the client site’s location. Whatever approach is used should be\ndocumented in the required documentation for this measure. We note that the stratification by\nage in the total vaccines administered within the reporting period enables comparisons with the\nvaccines submitted electronically metric.\n\nWe clarify that the measure pertains to immunizations electronically submitted to IISs\nthrough certified health IT. Immunizations submitted via web portals or alternate mechanisms,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch as manual submission of spreadsheets, would not be reported in the immunizations\nsubmitted electronically metrics, but, given that these were administered but not electronically\nsubmitted via certified health IT, they would be included in the metrics for the number of\nimmunizations administered overall, age category and IIS. We do not believe it is feasible to\nremove these from the total vaccines administered metrics; however, if available, the volume of\nimmunizations could be noted in the health IT developer’s supplemental reporting to provide\nadditional insight and context.\n\nWe also appreciate the requests for clarification on whether doses tagged as newly\nadministered are included. We acknowledge that the “transmission to immunization registries” (§\n170.315(f)(1)) criterion includes historical vaccines and newly administered vaccines, giving\nhealth IT developers that certify to this criterion the capability to report both. We note this\ntreatment of historical vaccines administered applies to data migrated from one EHR to another,\nand vaccines that were previously administered by another provider site. Because the proposed\nmeasure referred to administered immunizations (and not historical specifically), we clarify that\nthe finalized measure will only count immunizations newly administered during the reporting\nperiod and will not count historical vaccines previously administered that were recorded during\nthe reporting period. The inclusion of historical vaccines in addition to newly administered\nvaccines within one measure would be difficult to interpret; in the future we may consider the\ninclusion of historical vaccines based upon industry experience and the input we have received.\n\nThe measure is not constrained to the type of health care provider who administered the vaccine\nor the location the vaccine was administered, provided the certified health IT is eligible for\nreporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification whether the immunization\nadministration would have to be within the reporting period or the IIS submission in the\nreporting period (or both).\n\n*Response.* For the metric, immunizations administered that were electronically submitted\nsuccessfully to IISs, immunizations should be both administered and submitted during the\nreporting period. An immunization administered outside the reporting period but submitted\nduring the reporting period would not count for these metrics. We note that if no\nacknowledgment is received for immunizations administered, and submitted during the reporting\nperiod, then the immunization would count as successfully submitted.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on whether health IT vendors will be\nrequired to calculate a percentage and if so, requested ONC provide explicit guidance on the\ncalculation components.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that ONC will be responsible for calculating percentages based on\nthe counts that health IT developers submit.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the measure as “immunization administrations electronically submitted\nto immunization information systems through certified health IT” in § 170.407(a)(3)(vi). We\nhave revised the proposed measure based on public comments received. Specific metrics to\nsupport this finalized measure are listed below and described in the accompanying measure\nspecification located on ONC’s website. We also note that if regulatory baselines associated with\nthe metrics change in the future – such as a revision to a criterion through notice and comment\nrulemaking – the measure specification would also be changed to ensure alignment with the\nrevised criterion. The reporting period for the measure and related metrics below consists of one\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncalendar year. Data collection for the measures and associated metrics will begin during the first\nand second phases of reporting (which is described later in the preamble):\n1. Number of immunizations administered overall (year 1),\n2. Number of immunizations administered overall by IIS and age category (year 2).\n\n3. Number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted\nsuccessfully to IISs overall (year 1),\n4. Number of immunizations administered that were electronically submitted\nsuccessfully to IISs overall, by IIS and age category (year 2).\n\nImmunization History and Forecasts Through Certified Health IT Measure\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, in § 170.407(a)(9), we proposed to adopt a public health\ninformation exchange measure to require reporting on the number and percentage of IIS queries\nmade per individual with an encounter (88 FR 23843). The “immunization history and forecasts”\nmeasure would capture the use of certified health IT to query information from an IIS under the\n“transmission to immunization registries” (§ 170.315(f)(1)) criterion. Therefore, we proposed\n(88 FR 23843) that developers of certified health IT with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(f)(1) would be required to report for this measure. We emphasized that understanding\nwhether health care providers are engaging in electronically querying immunization information\nfrom IIS is critical to public health preparedness.\n\nFor the numerator, we proposed (88 FR 23843) developers of certified health IT with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(f)(1) report the number of query responses received\nsuccessfully from an IIS overall and by subgroup, by IIS and age group (adults (18 years and\nover) and children/infants (17 years and younger)) during the reporting period. The definition of\na successful response from an IIS should be the total number of messages submitted minus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nacknowledgments with errors (2.5.1, severity level of E). However, since HL7 Z42 messages\ncontain both immunization history and forecast, whereas Z32 messages exclusively contain\nhistory, we sought comment (88 FR 23843) on whether both message types should be included\nin the measure numerator.\n\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23843), the first denominator we proposed\nfor this measure would be the total number of immunization queries overall and by subgroup, by\nIIS and age group (adults (18 years and over) and children/infants (17 years and younger))\nduring the reporting period. We proposed to add this denominator to the measure proposed by\nthe Urban Institute to provide data on the total number of query responses that are and are not\nsuccessfully received from an IIS, as this will give further insights into any potential technical\nchallenges that may be occurring during query exchange. The second denominator we proposed\nfor this measure would be the total number of encounters overall and by subgroup during the\nreporting period. However, since it is unlikely that queries happen for every patient encounter,\nwe sought comment (88 FR 23843) on whether the second denominator should capture to total\nnumber of applicable patient encounters during the reporting period regardless of whether a\nquery was sent to an IIS. We proposed (88 FR 23843) that the numerator and denominator\ncounts would be reported overall (across IIS and age subgroups) during the reporting period and\nby the number of IIS queries made by IIS and age group (adults (18 years and over) and\nchildren/infants (17 years and younger) during the reporting period. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule\n(88 FR 23843), we conveyed our belief that reporting by these subgroups would be necessary to\ninterpret the data and create public awareness that could inform IISs and other public health\nparticipants about the progress being made in immunization data exchange. We sought comment\n(88 FR 23843) on whether children/infants should be further divided and by what age limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also proposed (88 FR 23843) developers of certified health IT with Health IT\nModules certified to § 170.315(f)(1) would attest that they are unable to report on this measure if\nthey have no users that administered immunizations during the reporting period. There may also\nbe providers who do not administer immunizations but would want to query an IIS to determine\nwhether their patient has received a vaccination. We sought comments (88 FR 23843) on\nwhether we should include this exclusion or suggestions on how we could better refine it.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters expressed support for the proposed measure, stating that\ncomprehensive immunization history and forecasts through certified health IT enables health\ncare providers to proactively manage immunization programs and promote preventative care.\n\nAlso, by utilizing certified health IT to track history and generate forecasts, health care providers\ncan identify immunization gaps, schedule timely vaccinations, and implement outreach\ninitiatives to increase vaccination rates.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of the proposed measure and\nappreciate the examples of how the measure would support improvements in preventive care for\npatients. We agree that this measure, which provides insights on how certified health IT is used\nto support health care providers to electronically query immunization information from IIS, is\ncritical to public health preparedness.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern with the second denominator, stating that\nthe total number of visits will not accurately reflect the number of immunization query messages\nexpected to be generated, as not all encounters can reasonably be expected to result in a query\nmessage, and suggested an alternate measure to include a numerator defined as the total number\nof unique individuals queried for during the reporting period and a denominator defined as the\ntotal number of unique individuals with encounters during the reporting period. Another\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenter recommended that ONC develop a simpler definition of encounters that developers\ncan apply to their own systems and encounter classification structures or establish a clear set of\nencounter type categories with fully defined mapping such as OMB/CDC Race\ncategories/details. The same commenter suggested ONC coordinate with CMS to ensure that the\nvalue set references include all SNOMED and CPT codes in the proposal or identified\nalternatives. One commenter recommended modifying the second denominator to include\nencounters with immunizing provider sites rather than all encounters.\n\n*Response.* We concur that not all encounters can be expected to generate a query to an\nIIS. Therefore, as one commenter noted, the number of visits may not reflect the number of\nimmunization queries expected. We may collaborate with the community to consider the\nmeasure of unique patients for whom queries were made to the IIS for future rulemaking. The\nmeasure does not include encounter-based metric from the immunization measure domain to\naddress the concern raised by commenters that not all encounters can be expected to result in a\nquery message. We will still receive counts of the number of unique patients with an encounter\nduring the reporting period, as proposed (and finalized) in the “consolidated clinical document\narchitecture (C-CDA) problems, medications, and allergies reconciliation and incorporation\nthrough certified health IT” measure. We refer readers to the definition of terms section\nimmediately following this section for a more detailed discussion on defining encounters.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters expressed concern with the intent and interpretation of the\nproposed measure. One commenter stated that if the intent is to assess the overall functioning of\nbidirectional query, ONC should clarify this intent such that a low ratio does not reflect poorly\non the developer of certified health IT or the querying organizations. One commenter\ncommented that it was their experience that some IISs are not ready to return the data for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresponse to the query and noted that this would impact the countable events for this measure and\nshould be publicly disclosed if/when the data is published. One commenter recommended that\nthese measures be considered exploratory and should not be used to penalize any certified health\nIT product or developer.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge that some IIS are not able to return data for a query response\nand as such, agree that the finalized measure should be seen as informative and reflects the role\nthat the health IT developers, health care providers, and IIS systems play with the exchange of\nthis information. We acknowledge that an IIS may have issues in returning the data for response\nto the query, thus impacting the value of this measure. We recognize this contextual information\nwill be important to note with the publication of these data. Where health IT developers\nencounter instances where a complete bidirectional loop is not possible, we encourage health IT\ndevelopers to document this information in the supplemental reporting to allow for more\ncomplete understanding of the metrics.\n\nIn this finalized measure, counts of queries sent to an IIS and responses received\nsuccessfully are intended to provide insight on the functioning of bidirectional query to obtain\nimmunization data. The metrics reported by health IT developers will provide new insights for\nONC and the public health community that are currently unavailable at a national level. By\nunderstanding trends related to queries made and responses received over time, we will also gain\nfeedback on the performance of queries and responses, which are part of the “transmission to\nimmunization registries” (§ 170.315(f)(1)) criterion. As noted above, we will receive counts of\nthe number of unique patients with an encounter during the reporting period, as proposed (and\nfinalized) in the “consolidated clinical document architecture (C-CDA) problems, medications,\nand allergies reconciliation and incorporation through certified health IT” measure, and expect to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuse this data to provide encounter context to the “public health information exchange” measures.\n\nTogether, these metrics can inform efforts to increase the availability of IIS data for health care\nproviders to have a more complete immunization background for individuals and groups of\npatients. We plan to collaborate with the community to consider the measure of unique patients\nfor whom queries were made to the IIS for future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification on the proposed numerator. One\ncommenter noted that the proposed numerator reflects the interoperability of the IIS, not the\ncertified health IT, and requested clarification on “received,” stating that the successful response\ndefinition is not clear in cases where the error can be detected by the certified health IT in the IIS\nresponse such as “received technically” versus “received into the chart.” A few commenters\nrequested clarification on how “refines” are counted for measurement, when a query attempt\nmust be refined before a successful attempt, and suggested the numerator should reflect total\nqueries performed.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concern expressed that the metric does not reflect the\ninteroperability of certified health IT. Through our measures we seek to assess bidirectional\nexchange activity between IIS and certified health IT, which can help identify potential issues\nrelated to interoperability and track trends over time. We appreciate the comments and the\nopportunity to provider greater clarity. In this final rule, we clarify that the metrics for the\nnumber of query responses received successfully from IISs overall, and by IIS, should count an\nIIS response as “received technically,” in the form of a message or transaction. This clarification\naddresses that health care providers may not ingest all responses into the record. We agree that\nthe initial query and each refined query should individually increment the total number of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimmunization queries sent to an IIS in order to acknowledge the effort to ensure a successful\nquery.\n\n*Comments.* A couple commenters expressed support that acknowledgement with a\nseverity level of “E” be considered a failure for purposes of the measure. One commenter noted\nthat an error with a severity level of “E” could be included in either an acknowledgment or a\nresponse (RSP) message. A couple commenters noted that a significant portion of messaging\nfailures are communication failures where there will be no response received which should be\nexcluded from the denominator or included in a separate metric. The commenter suggested that\nmessages of “no patient found” or “too many patients” found, as well as messages with no\nresponse from the IIS (in the case of downtime, for example), would be considered successful.\n\nOne commenter requested clarification on whether a query response message responding that a\npatient match was not possible should be counted in the numerator. The commenter also\nsuggested that the submission of descriptive context should be required, stating that it may help\nwith future evolution and fine tuning of the measures.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments received regarding that the measure should\nconsider acknowledgements with a severity level of “E” as a failed message. We confirm that\nonly severity level of “E” for messages are excluded from the metrics, the number of query\nresponses received successfully from IISs overall and by IIS. We also appreciate the additional\ndescription of communication failure scenarios due to IIS downtime or other accessibility issues.\n\nWe will collaborate with the community to monitor how these instances impact the measure’s\ninterpretation and determine if it should be revised in the future. At this time, we will not require\nhealth IT developers to provide separate counts for communication failures and counts of the\ndescriptive context levels. We encourage health IT developers to capture information about\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommunication failures as their functionality permits and include this explanation in the\nsupplemental documentation.\n\n*Comments.* In our request for public comment regarding whether both Z42 and Z32\nmessages should be included in the metrics, several commenters suggested that both Z42 and\nZ32 messages be included, stating that both are objectively relevant to patient care, contain\nsignificantly similar content, and have both been implemented in the real world.\n\n*Response.* Given the support expressed in response to our specific question, the metrics,\nthe number of query responses received successfully from IISs overall and by IIS will include\nZ42 and Z32 messages.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters representing health IT developers expressed concern related to\nthe proposed measure’s stratification by IIS and age. These commenters suggested that the initial\nimplementation of the measure should only require administration submission counts and that the\ndevelopment burden was high relative to the value of the stratifications. Other commenters\nsupported the stratifications as defined, given that not all jurisdictions require comprehensive\nadult reporting. One commenter noted that additional age stratification was unnecessary and\nmight add complexity. One commenter suggested delaying or eliminating the “immunization\nhistory and forecasts” measure.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments that indicated support for the measure's proposed\nstratifications, but that development burden would be high especially associated with the age\nstratification. We acknowledge that the age stratification is not as critical early on for this\nmeasure (compared to the submission of immunization data) as there are no state and jurisdiction\nlevel mandates for querying history and forecasts which vary by age. Therefore, we have delayed\nthe implementation of this measure from \"year 1” to “year 2” to provide health IT developers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore time to produce the measure. Furthermore, the reporting by IIS will be delayed to “year 3.”\n\nWe have not removed this measure as suggested by one commenter as there was a high level of\nsupport for this measure and we are providing additional time to implement the metric and\nrelated stratification.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on how a query sent to multiple IIS\nshould be counted. One commenter requested clarification on whether the first denominator\nshould include only query response messages that support both the history and forecast. One\ncommenter requested clarification on whether developers would be required to calculate a\npercentage and if so, ONC must provide explicit guidance on the calculation components.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that the metrics related to the total number of immunization queries\nsent (overall and by IIS), should be incremented for each query sent to an IIS and the metrics\nrelated to number of query responses received successfully from an IIS (overall and by IIS),\nshould increment for each successful message received. The measure should count queries and\nresponse messages so that the increment occurs for history, forecast, or history and forecast. This\napproach is supported by the “transmission to immunization registries” (§ 170.315(f)(1))\ncriterion that treats forecast and history separately. At this time, health IT developers are not\nrequired to report separate metrics for forecast and history. We clarify that ONC will calculate\npercentages based on the counts that the health IT developer submits.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that they did not agree with excluding queries\nperformed by health care providers who do not administer immunizations, while another\ncommenter recommended excluding these health care providers for simplicity.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge that the suggestion to constrain the measure to only include\nhealth care providers who immunize simplifies the interpretation of results. However, the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) recommends that all healthcare professionals,\nregardless of whether they administer vaccines, routinely assess patients for vaccines due.<sup>210</sup>\nFurthermore, there was no consensus across the comments to make this change. In this phase of\nreporting, it may add burden for health IT developers to segment the measure by whether the\nhealth care providers are immunizing providers. Therefore, the measure does not make\ndistinctions for health care providers who do and do not administer immunizations and will\ncollaborate with the community to understand the potential to incorporate this aspect in future\nrulemaking.\n\nFinalization of Measure\nWe have finalized the measure as “immunization history and forecasts through certified\nhealth IT” in § 170.407(a)(3)(vii). We have revised the proposed measure based on public\ncomments received. Specific metrics to support this finalized measure are listed below and\ndescribed in the accompanying measure specification located on ONC’s website. We also note\nthat if regulatory baselines associated with the metrics change in the future – such as a revision\nto a criterion through notice and comment rulemaking – the measure specification would also be\nchanged to ensure alignment with the revised criterion:\n1. Number of immunization queries sent to IISs overall (year 2).\n\n2. Number of immunization queries sent to IISs overall by IIS (year 3).\n\n3. Number of query responses received successfully from IISs overall (year 2).\n\n4. Number of query responses received successfully from IISs overall by IIS (year\n3).\n\n\nFootnote 210:\nNVAC Standards for Adult Immunization Practice: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-\npractice/standards/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reporting period for the measure and related metrics above consists of one calendar\nyear. Data collection for these measures and associated metrics will begin during the second and\nthird phase of reporting (which is described later in the preamble).\n\nEncounters\nFor measures where patient encounters are relevant, we proposed the definition of an\nencounter should be based on the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) outpatient\nvalue set and SNOMED CT inpatient encounter codes. For outpatient codes, developers should\nuse NCQA’s Outpatient Value Set.211,<sup>212</sup>\nFor inpatient codes, developers should use SNOMED\nCT codes 4525004, 183452005, 32485007, 8715000, and 448951000124107.<sup>213</sup>\nListed below is\na description of each SNOMED CT code:\n• Emergency department patient visit (procedure) – 4525004\n• Emergency hospital admission (procedure) – 183452005\n• Hospital admission (procedure) - 32485007\n• Hospital admission, elective (procedure) - 8715000\n• Admission to observation unit (procedure) - 448951000124107\nComments. Several commenters requested guidance for implementation of encounter\nvalue sets. Commenters representing health IT developers suggested adopting a broad definition\nof encounters for developers to apply and map to their own classification structures, while others\n\n\nFootnote 211:\nSee: 2022 Quality Rating System Measure Technical Specifications. Published October 2021.\nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/2022-qrs-measure-technical-specifications.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 212:\nNCQA’s Outpatient Value Set is available with a user ID and login at https://store.ncqa.org/my-2021-quality-\nrating-system-qrs-hedis-value-set-directory.html; or https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/expansions?pr=all OID:\n2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.101.12.1087.\n\n\nFootnote 213:\nAvailable for search at https://www.findacode.com/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuggested constraining the codes to a more limited and defined set. One commenter suggested\nlimiting inpatient encounter codes to discharges only.\n\nSeveral commenters supported the proposed approach (FR 23832) to align Insights\nCondition value sets for encounters with CMS programs. Commenters representing quality\nmeasure developers supported the proposed value sets that are used in electronic clinical quality\nmeasures (eCQMs). While calling for alignment with CMS programs, several commenters\nrepresenting health IT developers recommended that the encounter value sets should follow\nindustry standards, such as the FHIR Encounter.type field in the US Core Implementation\nGuide.<sup>214</sup>\nResponse. We agree with commenters on the importance of aligning encounter value sets\nwith industry approaches as well as re-using existing value sets that support CMS programs to\nreduce the burden of developing and reporting Insights Condition measures. In the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23832), we proposed to define encounters leveraging a code set defined\nby the National Committee for Quality Assurance and recommended by the HITAC, while\nrequesting comment on alternative approaches. We proposed this approach in large part to align\nwith existing measurement approaches used within CMS programs. As commenters described,\nnot all codes included in the proposed approach are reflected in the US Core IG version 6.1.0,\nwhich is the version we believe commenters referenced. Based on public comment, we have\nrevised the definition of encounters to maintain alignment with definitions of encounters within\nexisting quality measurement approaches used by CMS while responding to industry concerns\nabout burden and potential misalignment. Specifically, several CMS programs, including the\n\n\nFootnote 214:\nhttps://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromoting Interoperability Program and the Quality Payment Program, require the counting of\nencounters using specific codes, and CMS maintains an CQM library that specifies specific\nencounter codes related to quality measurement. <sup>215</sup>\nDevelopers of certified health IT have years\nof experience with those reporting efforts. Specifically, health IT certified to any criterion in §\n170.315(c)(1) through (4) supports recording, importing, reporting or filtering CQMs, and health\nIT certified to § 170.315(g)(1) or (2), supports numerator recording and measure calculation for\neach Promoting Interoperability Program percentage-based measure. For the purpose of the\nInsights Condition, we define applicable encounters as all encounters that the developer includes\nin its calculation of encounters within the existing certification criteria in § 170.315(g)(1) or (2)\nand the CQMs that they have presented for certification as part of certification to § 170.315(c).\n\nFor those developers that do not attest to any of the certification criteria at § 170.315(c), (g)(1) or\n(2), we specify that they include all encounters regardless of encounter code. Based upon\nanalysis of the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL), we note that of the 306 products\ncurrently certified to § 170.315(b)(2), 281 are certified to at least one of the included criteria,\nwith 232 certified to criterion in § 170.315(c) and 260 certified to § 170.315(g)(1) or (g)(2).\n\nIn finalizing this approach, we have eliminated the prescriptive approach to defining\nvalue sets that delineate encounters taken in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, which was based on a\nspecific set of quality measures and their associated Value Sets. The finalized approach instead\nrelies on existing developer competencies and experience as demonstrated by their existing\n\n\nFootnote 215:\nMedicare Promoting Interoperability Program Specification Sheets https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-\nguidance/promoting-interoperability-programs/resource-library.\neCQM Library https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-\nGuidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/eCQM_Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertification to any criterion in § 170.315(c)(1) through (4), (g)(1) or (g)(2) while retaining a\nclose link to existing quality measurement. Our goal in finalizing this approach is to build upon\nexisting CMS program requirements, certification criteria, and developer of certified health IT’s\nexperience with these requirements. Rather than specify specific value sets, our intent is to allow\nthe definition of an encounter to evolve as use of CQMs and approaches within this Program and\nthe Quality Payment Program change. In finalizing this approach, we have also emphasized\nalignment with measurement within CMS programs (i.e., eCQM and Promoting Interoperability\npercentage-based measures) rather than following industry standards, such as the FHIR\nEncounter.type field in the US Core Implementation Guide. As approaches within CMS’\nprograms come into alignment with industry standards, the measure of encounters within the\nInsights Condition will also come into alignment. For developers that do not currently support\nthe identification of specific types of encounters, our intent is to avoid creating a new\nrequirement to implement specific terminologies or code sets.\n\nCounts of Unique Patients\nComments. One commenter opposed the use of unique patient counts in the proposed\nmeasures under the Insights Condition. Further, the commenter stated unique patient counts\nwhen aggregating across many certified health IT instances would require significant burden and\ncost to deduplicate across customer databases. The commenter requested that ONC either change\nto transaction-based counts or clarify that unique patient counts will be unique only within each\ninstance of the certified health IT and can be duplicated across instances.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for this input, and as noted in the individuals’ access\nto EHI measurement area section in this preamble, we have revised our definition of unique\npatient counts so that counts would only be unique within each instance of the certified health IT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recognize the potential difficulty of de-duplicating unique patients across more than one\ninstance of a certified health IT and clarify that the patient counts should be unique within the\ninstance and can be duplicative across instances.\n\n3. Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification – Requirements\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23843), the Cures Act specifies that a\nhealth IT developer be required, as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement\nunder the Program, to submit responses to reporting criteria in accordance with the “Electronic\nHealth Record Reporting Program” established under section 3009A of the PHSA, as added by\nthe Cures Act, with respect to all certified technology offered by such developer. We proposed to\nimplement the Cures Act “Electronic Health Reporting Program” Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements as the “Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification” (Insights\nCondition) requirements in § 170.407. As a Condition of Certification, we proposed that\ndevelopers of certified health IT would submit responses to comply with the Insights Condition’s\nrequirements, described in this section of the preamble in relation to the Insights Condition’s\nmeasures and associated certification criteria.\n\n*Comments.* A number of health IT developers expressed concern about the burden that\ncollecting and reporting measures for the Insights Condition will impose on health IT developers.\n\nA commenter stated that developing Insights Condition measures overlaps and competes with\nhealth IT developers’ other priorities, including CMS’ digital quality initiative and user\nrequested analytics. One commenter expressed concern that the requirements would introduce\nbarriers to market entry and reduce competition. However, one health IT developer commented\nthat they do not believe that the Insights Condition presents a significant regulatory burden, as\nthe measure data can be collected and reported using currently widespread technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatedly, many commenters, including health IT developers, developer associations, and\nhealth systems, opposed the overall number and type of measures proposed in § 170.407 for the\nInsights Condition. Commenters suggested reducing the number and complexity of measures to\nreduce burden and improve feasibility for developers of certified health IT and their customers.\n\nCommenters stated the number of measures is higher than described due to the multiple\nnumerators and denominators. Commenters recommended ONC remove the list of expected\nmetrics or ratios and focus only on the individual data elements to be collected and reported.\n\nSome commenters suggested 10 or fewer counts as a starting point. One commenter indicated\nthat there were duplicate measures in the set that should be combined or harmonized. One\ncommenter recommended that ONC select measures that are well-defined and targeted, and\ndesigned not to heavily burden health IT system resources when collecting data. Commenters\nalso suggested gradually increasing the number of measures over several years.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed for the potential burden imposed on\nhealth IT developers to report the Insight Condition measures. We emphasize the Insights\nCondition fulfills the Cures Act specified requirements in section 4002(c) to establish an\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) Reporting Program to provide transparent reporting on certified\nhealth IT.\n\nWe believe this final rule will address information gaps in the health IT marketplace and\nprovide useful insights on certified health IT use while minimizing implementation burden on\nhealth IT developers. Our final rule includes multiple revisions to our proposals, described in\ngreater detail throughout this section of the preamble under their respective sections, that are\nintended to minimize the burden on health IT developers in implementing the Insights Condition.\n\nIn sum, for this final rule, we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Delayed the submission of the first phase of measures and related metrics to July 2027 to\nallow health IT developers adequate time to develop and implement the measures.\n\n• Established a more incremental approach for implementing the measures over a longer\ntimeframe (three years), including phasing in more complex aspects of the measures.\n\nExtending the time frame will allow developers to work on other priorities, such as CMS’\ndigital quality initiative and user requested analytics, and not have to exclusively focus on\ndeveloping Insights Condition measures.\n\n• Not finalized two proposed measures (“electronic health information export through\ncertified health IT” and “C-CDA documents obtained using certified health IT by\nexchange mechanism”).\n\n• Addressed potentially duplicate metrics to make it easier to understand the total number\nof unique metrics that are required. For example, the same encounter-related metrics were\npreviously listed in the patient access, immunization, and clinical exchange measure\nspecification. Those metrics are now only listed in the clinical exchange section and\nmeasure specification.\n\n• Reduced the frequency of measure reporting from semiannual to annual, and changed the\nsubmission date for more convenience to health IT developers.\n\n• Provided an alternative reporting approach for health IT developers who are not able to\nreport on their entire customer base due to contractual reasons. This should limit the need\nto renegotiate contracts for the sole reason of complying with the Insights Condition\nrequirements addressing a major source of burden. This approach is described below in\nsection III.F.4 of this final rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Supported health IT developers who choose to use their Insights Condition measurements\nand data as part of their Real World Testing plans and results, thus reducing the need to\ngenerate separate data for both Conditions of Certification.\n\n• Replaced the terms numerators and denominators, which caused confusion from\ncommenters, with lists of metrics within each measure that health IT developers will be\nrequired to report, and limited stratification of measures.\n\n• Consolidated the required Insights Condition measures and related metrics into the table\nthat is located later in this section of the preamble.\n\nWe do not believe that the Insights Condition introduces a barrier to market entry. The\nminimum reporting qualifications we proposed and have subsequently finalized further below in\nthis preamble are designed to ensure that small and startup developers are not unduly\ndisadvantaged by the Insights Condition requirements. Further, the availability of information on\nwhat capabilities are widely available or lacking in the marketplace may encourage new entrants\nto provide needed technologies.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters raised concerns that customers of health IT developers\nwill perceive burden and lack incentives that would impact their willingness to allow access to\ndata for health IT developers to report in order to comply with the Insights Condition\nrequirements. A few commenters encouraged ONC to coordinate with CMS on ways to provide\ninsights on EHI access, exchange, and use while reducing physician burden related to\nrequirements for the Insights Condition and the CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested ONC collaborate with CMS to adopt regulatory\nrequirements to promote customers of health IT developers to agree to allow data from their\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsystems to be used for the Insights Condition. One medical professional society commenter\nsuggested that ONC coordinate with CMS and use the Insights Condition data and metrics to\naugment CMS physician reporting requirements. Further, the commenter stated the goals of\nreducing physician reporting burden and providing CMS and ONC insight into EHI access,\nexchange, or use can be jointly achieved by allowing physicians to attest to meeting CMS\nreporting requirements, rather than reporting a numerator-denominator, supplemented by health\nIT developers reported data under the Insights Condition. One commenter stated that attestations\nexist for agreeing to cooperate with ONC-ACB surveillance activities as a precedent for such an\nattestation requirement.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the suggestion for ONC to collaborate with CMS. We recognize\nthat health care providers in certain CMS programs were expected to attest to cooperate in “good\nfaith” with both ONC-ACB surveillance activities and ONC Direct Reviews.216,<sup>217</sup>\nWe will\nexplore potential opportunities with CMS to encourage support for the Insights Condition among\nhospitals, physicians and other healthcare professionals that participate in CMS programs. We\nwill also explore potential opportunities with CMS on ways to reduce burden on physicians and\nother health care providers related to reporting requirements. We will continue to coordinate and\nwork with CMS on points of intersection for potential future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern that the Insights Condition reporting\nrequirements will lead to increased burden or frustration for health care providers and health care\nprovider organizations and encouraged ONC to consider the impacts of Insights Condition\n\n\nFootnote 216:\n42 CFR 495.40(a)(2)(i)(H). Demonstration of meaningful use criteria. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-\n42/chapter-IV/subchapter-G/part-495#p-495.40(a)(2)(i)(H).\n\n\nFootnote 217:\n42 CFR 414.1375(b)(3). Promoting Interoperability (PI) performance category.\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-414/subpart-O/section-414.1375\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreporting by health IT developers on their customers. Commenters also expressed concerns that\nhealth IT developers will ‘pass on’ the burden of reporting to end users (i.e., health care\nproviders), who will end up being required to assist their developers of certified health IT in\ncollecting data or creating reports for the Insights Condition. Some commenters indicated that\nhealth care providers and health care provider organizations are already overburdened with\nreporting requirements. One commenter expressed concern about creating any additional direct\nor indirect reporting burden for rural and underserved health care providers. A few commenters\nsuggested to reduce health care provider burden by making healthcare organization participation\nand data contribution optional and avoid selecting measures that will require mapping of data by\nthe healthcare organization staff. One advocacy organization and a health system expressed\nsupport for ONC efforts to establish the Insights Condition and encouraged ONC to minimize its\nadministrative burdens.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by commenters and aims to minimize\nburden on customers of developers of certified health IT related to the Insights Condition. We\nemphasize that developers of certified health IT are responsible for reporting the Insights\nCondition measures, and that health care providers, including health care providers who provide\ncare to rural and underserved populations, are not responsible for reporting under the Insights\nCondition.\n\nWe have sought to design the measures so they would not require providers to separately\ncollect data outside of their normal activities as part of delivering care or create reports to assist\ndevelopers of certified health IT for the Insights Condition measures. The measures are designed\nto come from system-generated data and not involve additional effort by health care providers.\n\nWe believe that, using widely available database technology, health IT developers should be able\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto collect data required for reporting under the Insights Condition without significant end-user\nburden. As noted in the clinical care information exchange measurement area of the preamble,\nwe did not adopt the “C-CDA documents obtained using certified health IT by exchange\nmechanism” measure, partly because it was identified as potentially requiring mapping of data at\nthe healthcare organization level.\n\nWe describe earlier in this section of the preamble the multiple changes to our proposals\nthat are intended to minimize the burden on health IT developers in implementing the Insights\nCondition. These changes to our proposals are also intended to minimize the burden on\ncustomers of health IT developers. We believe this final rule includes several changes to our\nproposals that significantly reduce potential indirect burden on users (i.e., health care providers)\nof certified health IT. As noted earlier, we provide health IT developers with an alternative\nreporting option if they are unable to report on all their customers due to contractual reasons.\n\n*Comments.* One health system expressed support for the Insights Condition and requested\nclarification on how health IT developers will have access to the information in locally installed\nsystems to complete the reporting while maintaining appropriate confidentiality.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment. We expect that confidentiality would already be\naddressed in existing contracts or business agreements between the health IT developer and their\ncustomers. Health IT developers will not submit protected health information or personally\nidentifiable information to ONC under the Insights Condition. The data that we are requiring\nhealth IT developer to report is aggregated at the product level and is not at the health care\nprovider or patient level.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters were supportive of the measures in general, but\nrecommended restructuring the measures as a single set, in table format identifying the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassociated certification criteria, with numerator/denominator pair as its own row. Some\ncommenters provided a sample format for our consideration.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We have taken a more streamlined\napproach to categorizing, describing, and displaying the measures under the Insights Condition.\n\nWe also refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23831) for detailed background and\nhistory of the proposed measures as each measure description includes statements on the intent\nof the measure. For example, in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23834), we specified under the\n“individuals’ access to electronic health information supported by certified API technology”\n\n(now finalized as the “individuals’ access to electronic health information through certified\nhealth IT”) measure that we believe this measure would provide a national view into how\nindividuals access their EHI and would inform ONC and health IT community efforts to\nempower individuals with access to their EHI.\n\nWe provide the table below to define the updated metrics that health IT developers are\nrequired to provide to ONC at the product level. The table identifies the metrics a health IT\ndeveloper is required to report based on the certification criterion to which the health IT\ndeveloper certifies. We reiterate that the health IT developer is responsible for providing and\naggregating the data for each applicable “metric” at the product level. The table reflects the\nmetrics that have been modified in some cases based on public comment and described in more\ndetail below. We clarify that “year 1” refers to the first implementation year of the Insights\nCondition. Data collection during “year 1” starts in calendar year 2026 (January 1st\n, 2026-\nDecember 31st\n, 2026), with responses due in July 2027. Reporting is on an annual basis\nthereafter. The measures designated with “year 2” will begin data collection calendar year 2027,\nwith responses due in July 2028 (and annually thereafter). The “year 3” measures start data\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollection in calendar year 2028, with responses due July 2029 (and annually thereafter). The\nreporting period for each of the measures below consists of one calendar year. Please refer to the\nmeasure specifications for details on the metrics, including definitions.\n\n\n\n\ntesting, and other categories, as appropriate to measure the performance of EHR technology. The\ncommenter encouraged ONC to focus on these additional areas for future measure development\nfor the Insights Condition.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their encouragement to consider other areas for\nfuture measure development. As described in our HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832), we\nintend for this first set of measures to provide insights on the interoperability category specified\nin the Cures Act. We intend to explore the other Cures Act categories (security, usability and\nuser-centered design, conformance to certification testing, and other categories to measure the\nperformance of EHR technology) in future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements including the Insights Condition should actively seek to identify bias and prevent\nuse of algorithms that may cause discrimination against patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this suggestion and will consider ways that the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements can help reduce bias and prevent harmful use of\nalgorithms in patient care. We note that this final rule includes requirements that aim to introduce\ninformation transparency about Predictive DSIs supplied by health IT developers as part of their\ncertified Health IT Modules, so that potential users have sufficient information about how a\nPredictive DSI was designed, developed, trained, and evaluated to determine whether it is\ntrustworthy, including evaluation of fairness or bias. We refer readers to section III.C.5\n(Decision Support Interventions and Predictive Models) of this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter questioned whether ONC could get the information about\nsome Insights Condition measures from existing sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment. As described in our HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR\n23831), our approach for identifying measures for the Insights Condition included several\nconsiderations, including measures reflecting information that ONC cannot obtain without\nregulation and efforts that are not duplicative of other data collection. We will continue to\nconsider ways to reuse other data and reduce reporting burden while addressing information gaps\nin the health IT marketplace through the Insights Condition. Thus, the measures we finalized\naddress an important gap in information that can help assess interoperability.\n\nCross-Cutting Requirements\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832), we also proposed to apply certain\nrequirements across multiple measures, including, but not limited to: (1) data submitted by health\nIT developers would be provided and aggregated at the product level (across versions); (2) health\nIT developers would provide documentation related to the data sources and methodology used to\ngenerate these measures; and (3) health IT developers may also submit descriptive or qualitative\ninformation to provide context as applicable.\n\nWe explained in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832) that overall, the documentation\nshould help ensure the responses/data are interpreted correctly. Thus, the documentation related\nto the data sources and methodology would include the types of data sources used, how the\nmeasure was operationalized (e.g., any specific definitions), any assumptions about the data\ncollected, information on the providers or products that are included/excluded from the reported\ndata, and a description about how the data was collected. As described earlier in the preamble,\nwe would then use the measure data submitted by health IT developers to calculate the metrics\n(e.g., percentages and other related statistics). Developers of certified health IT would submit\nthis information to an independent entity, per statutory requirements in section 3009A(c) of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHSA, as part of the implementation of the Insights Condition, which we discuss later in this\nsection of the preamble.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported our proposal under the Insights Condition to\nrequire developers of certified health IT to report documentation used to generate each measure.\n\nThree commenters also supported the proposal for reporting optional documentation. One\ncommenter favored requiring health IT developers to explicitly outline how they collect,\naggregate, and analyze the data for the Insights Condition, including documentation on the\nassumptions made about the data and decisions made about the inclusion or exclusion of specific\ndata and/or installations. Some commenters suggested that ONC establish consistent topics and\ncategories for the required documentation submissions and requested having the option to keep\nthe additional information submissions confidential. One commenter recommended that ONC\nprohibit developers from using trade secrets to prevent validation of reporting data. One\ncommenter requested ONC define a clear and accessible pathway for public access to the\nInsights Condition data, as well as how identified issues will be mitigated by developers certified\nhealth IT. Further, the commenter noted that methodological transparency is essential to inform\ncustomers, regulators, and policymakers about what the Insights Condition was testing, how\ntesting was performed, and what the reporting informs about achievement of interoperability\nobjectives.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We have finalized that\ndevelopers of certified health IT are required under the Insights Condition to provide\ndocumentation related to the data sources and methodology used to generate these measures, and\nhealth IT developers may also submit descriptive or qualitative information to provide context as\napplicable. Later in this preamble, we also note that in accordance with the Cures Act, we intend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto make responses (the metrics and required documentation) to the Insights Condition publicly\navailable on our website. The metrics and required documentation will provide methodological\ntransparency and enable assessing progress related to interoperability as requested by\ncommenters.\n\nWe require that health IT developers, as part of their responses, will provide\ndocumentation used to generate the measures for more accurate and complete data calculation.\n\nAs we stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23832), the documentation should help ensure\nthe data are interpreted correctly. Therefore, the documentation related to the data sources and\nmethodology should include the types of data sources used, how the measure was\noperationalized (e.g., any specific definitions), any assumptions about the data collected,\ninformation on the health care providers or products that are included/excluded from the metrics,\nand a description about how the data was collected. We intend to make the required\ndocumentation provided by health IT developers publicly available for the purposes of\ntransparency and to allow interested parties to understand and interpret the data.\n\nWe do not anticipate that health IT developers will need to share any information they\nconsider proprietary, trade secret, or confidential information for the required documentation\nrelated to the Insights Condition. The documentation identified above does not specifically\nrequire the disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, or confidential information. Health IT\ndevelopers should be able to report without the sharing of any such information. If health IT\ndevelopers wish to provide additional information as part of the optional documentation, we\nstrongly encourage them to not include any proprietary, trade secret, or confidential information\nin their submission. Further, we intend to provide a method for health IT developers to first\nindicate whether they plan to share proprietary, trade secret, and/or confidential information for\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurposes of either required or optional documentation. If a health IT developer provides an\naffirmative indication, ONC will engage the developer in dialogue about potential alternative\nmeans of meeting either required documentation requirements or providing optional\ndocumentation (e.g., in other generalized or descriptive ways that may achieve the same goal).\n\nAs we noted in the Enhanced Oversight and Accountability (EOA) Final Rule (81 FR 72429), we\nwill implement appropriate safeguards to ensure, to the extent permissible under federal law, that\nany proprietary business information or trade secrets that are disclosed by the health IT\ndeveloper in its documentation would be kept confidential by ONC.<sup>218</sup>\nWe also refer readers to section III.F.4 of this final rule where we describe how we intend\nfor health IT developers to submit the metrics and related documentation electronically using a\nweb-based form, which will provide templates that enable submitting the data to ONC in a\nstructured, electronic format such as comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object\nNotation (JSON) for this purpose. For questions and comments that may arise in reviewing the\nresults and supporting documentation, we encourage the public to follow the Certified Health IT\nComplaint Process described at: https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certified-health-it-complaint-\nprocess.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters opposed our proposal that developers of certified\nhealth IT report measures aggregated at the product level, across product versions. Several\ncommenters recommended that ONC adopt a flexible approach where health IT developers can\nreport either at the product or developer level with an attestation to indicate which level the\n\n\nFootnote 218:\nThe Freedom of Information Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. Chapter 90,\ngenerally govern the disclosure and descriptions of these types of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT developer reported. Commenters noted that this level of flexibility is consistent with\nthe Real World Testing Condition.\n\nSome commenters stated that health IT developers with integrated products or platforms\nare not able to differentiate certain Insights Condition measures per product as proposed, making\nproduct level reporting impossible. In this circumstance, one action would be counted under\nmultiple products. One commenter recommended reporting be permitted at the integrated\ndatabase level instead of the product level to make reporting feasible. One commenter\nrecommended reporting at the developer level to avoid duplicate counting. One commenter\nstated health IT developers with both cloud and non-cloud-based products would have problems\naggregating data for reporting. Several commenters opposed any reporting at a level lower than a\ncertified Health IT Module.\n\nThree commenters requested reporting that is more granular, at the product version level.\n\nCommenters stated product version level reporting would better support health care provider and\nhealthcare organization evaluation and comparison of health IT capabilities.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback and acknowledge the variety of\nperspectives on this requirement. We have maintained and finalized in § 170.407(a)(1)(i)(A) that\ndata submitted by health IT developers would need to be provided and aggregated at the product\nlevel (across versions). However, we recognize that integrated products, which serve multiple\nsettings or support multiple CHPL ID products, will not be able to differentiate between the\nsettings or CHPL IDs when reporting on the measures. This could result in either double-\ncounting or only reporting for one product. To address this issue, we have revised our\nrequirement, related to integrated products, so that integrated products will only have to report\none response for two or more products that are integrated. The web-based form and templates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill allow for health IT developers to identify as submitting on behalf of an integrated product\nand to provide the associated CHPL IDs with the response.\n\nWe believe that product level data would provide insights on how performance on the\nmeasures vary by market (e.g., inpatient, outpatients, specialty) and by capabilities of products,\nwhereas this type of insight would not be available at the developer level. A product level focus\nis also aligned with other Program reporting requirements that allow for product level reporting,\nsuch as the Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification (85 FR 25765).\n\nIn considering alternatives, such as proposing to require health IT developers to report\nmeasures at the health IT developer level or at the most granular level of product version/CHPL\nID, we concluded that proposing to require data to be reported at the health IT developer level is\nunlikely to reduce burden given that data would still need to be obtained from each applicable\nproduct and then aggregated. We also concluded that proposing to require reporting at the\nproduct version/CHPL ID level could significantly increase burden because developers of\ncertified health IT would need separate reports for each version of their products. A flexible\napproach with a mix of data at the developer and product levels does not allow for a consistent\nanalysis and reporting across health IT developers.\n\nMinimum Reporting Qualifications\nAs required by section 3009A(a)(3)(C) of the PHSA, ONC worked with an independent\nentity, the Urban Institute, to develop measure concepts for the Insights Condition that would not\nunduly disadvantage small and startup developers. For detailed background, we refer readers to\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23843). Additionally, we proposed (88 FR 23844) to\nimplement the Insights Condition requirements in a way that does not unduly disadvantage small\nand startup developers of certified health IT. We proposed (88 FR 23844) to establish minimum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreporting qualifications that a developer of certified health IT must meet to report on the\nmeasure. Developers of certified health IT who do not meet the minimum reporting\nqualifications (as specified under each measure), would submit a response to specify that they do\nnot meet the minimum reporting qualifications under the Insights Condition measure. In this\nway, all developers of certified health IT would report on all measures, even if some report that\nthey do not meet the minimum reporting qualifications.\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23844), we proposed that the minimum reporting\nqualifications include whether a health IT developer has any applicable Health IT Modules\ncertified to criteria associated with the measure, and whether the developer has at least 50\nhospital users or 500 clinician users across its certified health IT products, which serves as a\nproxy for its size or maturation status (e.g., whether it is a startup) and refer readers to the HTI-1\nProposed Rule for details on how we determined the proposed thresholds for health IT\ndevelopers (88 FR 23845).\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23844) that if a developer of certified health IT does not meet these\nminimum reporting qualifications, it would be required to submit a response that it does not meet\nthe minimum reporting qualifications on specific measures for a given Health IT Module(s)\nsubject to the Insights Condition requirements. In addition, we proposed (88 FR 23844) that if a\nhealth IT developer does not have at least one product that meets the applicable certification\ncriteria specified in the measure requirements, or a developer of certified health IT that is\ncertified to the criterion or criteria specified in the applicable measure during the reporting period\nbut does not have any users using the functionality, the developer would still be required to\nsubmit a response that it does not meet the applicable certification criteria or the number of users\nrequired to report on the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported our proposal to establish minimum reporting\nqualifications that a developer of certified health IT must meet to report on each measure.\n\nHowever, commenters stated that minimum reporting qualification would be more appropriate at\nthe product level instead of at the developer level. Commenters recommended ONC maintain the\nproposed minimum reporting qualifications and apply those qualifications to individual products.\n\nOne commenter recommended applying the thresholds at the product version level.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the interest expressed in applying the minimum reporting\nqualifications at the product or product version levels. However, we believe applying minimum\nreporting qualifications at the developer level adequately addresses the Cures Act requirement\nfor the Insights Condition to not unduly disadvantage small and startup health IT developers.\n\nApplying minimum reporting qualifications at the product or product version levels could result\nin missing valuable data related to the use of certain certified health IT products.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters made a few requests for clarification on the minimum reporting\nqualifications. One commenter indicated that our minimum reporting qualifications are\nambiguous and asked ONC to clarify if the minimum reporting qualification is “50 users in a\nhospital” or “50 hospital sites that have users.”\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We have finalized the minimum\nreporting qualification in § 170.407(a)(2) to be at least 50 hospital sites or 500 individual\nclinician users across the developer’s certified health IT. We note that the 50 hospital sites\nthreshold is applicable to health IT modules used in inpatient or emergency department settings,\nwhile the 500 individual clinician users threshold is applicable to health IT modules used in\noutpatient/ambulatory settings (non-inpatient).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed that requiring health IT developers attest to not\nhaving technology certified to a given criterion for purposes of not reporting data for a specific\nInsights Condition measure was redundant since ONC maintains the list of certified health IT\nproducts.\n\n*Response.* The Cures Act requires that all developers of certified health IT report on all\nInsights Condition measures. We believe this attestation process provides for compliance with\nthat requirement in the simplest way.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested that the definition of “developer” be more specific\nto include the actual architects and engineers of the software itself. The commenter questioned if\nthe current definition of “developer” could also be interpreted to include organizations that\nprovide certified health IT access for practices/clinicians under MSSP agreements. Further, the\ncommenter noted these healthcare organizations would not have resources to comply with the\nInsights Condition.\n\n*Response.* The Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in subpart D of\n45 CFR part 170 apply to developers participating in the Program (see 45 CFR 170.400).\n\nTherefore, the finalized “Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification” requirements\n(codified in § 170.407) apply to developers participating in the Program that meet minimum\nreporting qualifications. Although we discuss the finalized “offer health IT” and updated “health\nIT developer of certified health IT” definitions for purposes of the information blocking\nregulations (45 CFR part 171), as discussed in sections IV.B.1 and IV.B.2 of this preamble, this\ncommenter’s request is out of scope for this final rule since we did not propose a definition in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule, and there is no codified definition of “developer” specific to the Program\nregulations in 45 CFR part 170 at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification – Process for Reporting\nWe proposed (88 FR 23846) in § 170.407(b)(1) that, as a Maintenance of Certification\nrequirement for the Insights Condition, developers of certified health IT would need to submit\nresponses every six months (i.e., two times per year) for any applicable certified Health IT\nModule(s) that have or have had an active certification at any time under the Program during the\nprior six months. We also proposed to provide developers of certified health IT with ample time\nto collect, assemble, and submit their data. We proposed (88 FR 23846) that developers of\ncertified health IT would be able to provide their submissions within a designated 30-day\nwindow, twice a year. Developers of certified health IT would begin collecting their data twelve\nmonths prior to the first 30-day submission window. The first six months of this period would be\nthe period that developers of certified health IT would report on for the first 30-day submission\nwindow. Developers of certified health IT would then have the next six months to assemble this\ndata for reporting. During the second six months of this period, developers of certified health IT\nwould begin collecting data for the next 30-day submission window and so on. We refer readers\nto the example we provided in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23846).\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23847) in § 170.407(b)(1)(i) that a developer of certified health IT\nmust provide responses beginning April 2025 for the following measures: (1) individuals’ access\nto electronic health information; (2) applications supported through certified health IT; (3)\nimmunization administrations electronically submitted to an immunization information system\nthrough certified health IT; and (4) immunization history and forecasts. We proposed (88 FR\n23847) in § 170.407(b)(1)(ii) that a developer of certified health IT must provide responses\nbeginning April 2026 for the remaining measures: (1) C-CDA documents obtained using\ncertified health IT by exchange mechanism; (2) C-CDA medications, allergies, and problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreconciliation and incorporation using certified health IT; (3) use of FHIR in apps supported by\ncertified API technology; (4) use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT; and (5)\nelectronic health information export through certified health IT. For further discussion regarding\nour rationale for these proposals, we refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23847).\n\nWe welcomed comments on our proposed approach, as well as the proposed frequency of\nreporting, other frequencies of reporting such as more or less frequent, and any additional\nburdens that should be considered for developers of certified health IT to meet the proposed\n“Insights Condition and Maintenance of Certification” requirements.\n\nWe also noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23847) that there may be other factors\nthat could impact a developer of certified health IT’s ability to easily collect data to comply with\nthe Insights Condition’s requirements. For example, a developer of certified health IT may have\ncontracts or business agreements that inhibit the health IT developer’s ability to collect data from\nits customers. We noted that in such scenarios, developers of certified health IT would need to\nrenegotiate their contracts if we finalized our proposals. We explained that we expected\ndevelopers of certified health IT would work to mitigate any issues and provisions affecting their\nability to comply with this Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement. Therefore, a\ndeveloper of certified health IT that is required to meet the Insights Condition’s requirements\nmust submit responses or may be subject to ONC direct review of the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements, corrective action, and enforcement procedures under\nthe Program. We welcomed comments on our approach, as well as any specific hardships\ncertified health IT may encounter with the Insights Condition of Certification.\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23847) that responses to the Insights Condition would occur via\nweb-based form and method, consistent with the requirements in § 3009A(c) of the PHSA. We\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnoted that under the statute, developers of certified health IT must report to an “independent\nentit[y]” to “collect the information required to be reported in accordance with the criteria\nestablished.” We intend to award a grant, contract, or other agreement to an independent entity as\npart of the implementation of the Insights Condition and will provide additional details through\nsubsequent information. We stated that we intend to make responses publicly available via an\nONC website, and we intend to provide developers of certified health IT the opportunity to\nsubmit qualitative notes that would enable them to explain findings and provide additional\ncontext and feedback regarding their submissions.\n\nFurther, we proposed (88 FR 23847) a new Principle of Proper Conduct for ONC-\nAuthorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) in § 170.523(u) that would require ONC-ACBs to\nconfirm that applicable developers of certified health IT have submitted their responses for the\nInsights Condition of Certification requirements in accordance with our proposals. We stated an\nexpectation that the ONC-ACBs would confirm whether or not the applicable health IT\ndevelopers submitted responses for the Insights Condition of Certification requirements within\nthe compliance schedule. The intent of this responsibility is not to duplicate the work of the\nindependent entity in collecting and reviewing the response submissions. Rather, it is meant to\nsupport the ONC-ACBs’ other responsibility in § 170.550(l) to ensure that developers of certified\nhealth IT are meeting their responsibilities under the Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements before issuing a certification.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters, including developers of certified health IT, opposed our\nexpectation related to § 170.407(b)(1) in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23847) that health IT\ndevelopers would need to renegotiate their contracts or business agreements that inhibit their\nability to collect data from their customers in order to comply with this requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenters stated that this expectation to renegotiate contracts or business agreements was\nunreasonable, not feasible, or overly burdensome.\n\nTwo commenters questioned the authority of ONC to require developers of certified\nhealth IT to renegotiate contracts or business agreements in order to gain access to customer data\nfor the Insights Condition. Two developers of certified health IT commented that they\nexperienced challenges in soliciting participation from customers in data collection for the Real\nWorld Testing Condition despite their efforts. One commenter noted that it is not feasible to\nrequire a renegotiation of client contracts specific to only one term without reopening\nrenegotiation of all contract terms. One commenter stated the amount of time that finding,\nassessing, negotiating, and re-finalizing a contract is unreasonable in the proposed timeframe.\n\nSeveral developers of certified health IT commented that ONC should require a good\nfaith effort by developers to engage their customers to participate. Also, commenters suggested\nONC include language in the Insights Condition that allows for exclusions or other flexibilities\nfrom reporting where health IT developers have been unable to obtain data for measures despite\ngood faith efforts.\n\nSeveral developers of certified health IT further commented that establishing a minimum\nthreshold of customers is not a viable way to address their concerns. One developer of certified\nhealth IT commented that ONC should set the expectation that health IT developers request\nparticipation in data collection under the Insights Condition from all of their U.S.-based\ncustomers of certified health IT and report all of the data from participants who agree, as well as\nwhat percentage of their total customers this represents. One commenter sought clarification\nfrom ONC on whether there is an expectation that developers of certified health IT obtain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumerator and denominator data from every U.S. customer using a product or only those\ncustomers agreeing to participate.\n\nOne commenter noted that time and cost estimates were not included in the Regulatory\nImpact Analysis for effort necessary from developers of certified health IT, or health systems, for\ncontract renegotiation expectations related to § 170.407(b)(1). The commenter further noted that\neffort from both health IT developers and health systems would be necessary for each\nrenegotiated contract.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ concerns regarding the feasibility of requiring\ndevelopers of certified health IT to renegotiate contracts, when needed, with their customers to\ncomply with the Insights Condition requirements. In response to public comment, we have\nremoved this proposed requirement. In a scenario where a developer of certified health IT has\ncontracts or business agreements with a customer that inhibit the health IT developer’s ability to\ncomply with the Insights Condition requirements, the health IT developer may exclude that\ncustomer’s data for reporting under the Insights Condition.\n\nIn § 170.407(b)(1) in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23847) we proposed that health IT\ndevelopers provide us metrics based upon data from all their customers. In response to health IT\ndevelopers expressing concerns regarding the difficulty in obtaining data from clients whose\ncontracts would require updating to access the needed data, we have scaled back our requirement\nfor health IT developers to provide complete data on all clients. In addition to the data on\navailable clients that they report, health IT developers will provide ONC with information on the\ndegree to which the data they are submitting is complete. We emphasize that the Insights\nCondition fulfills the Cures Act specified requirements in section 4002(c) to establish an\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) Reporting Program to provide transparent reporting on certified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT with respect to all certified technology offered by a health IT developer, and therefore,\nhealth IT developers should be as inclusive as possible.\n\nBased upon the suggestion we received via comments, we have finalized in §\n170.407(a)(1)(i)(C) that health IT developers will report the percentage of their total customers,\nas represented by hospitals for inpatient products and clinician users for their outpatient products,\nthat are included in their reported data for each metric for which they submit a response. The\npercentage of health care providers that are represented in the data provides transparency on the\ndegree to which the data are complete. Specifically, we seek to determine whether the aggregated\ndata that we receive from all health IT developers will produce nationally representative\nmeasures will be critical to generate and report the derived statistics and explain the results. For\nexample, if the percentage of total customers represented is low across many health IT\ndevelopers, then we would know that the data are incomplete. This in turn, would enable ONC to\nconsider whether it would be valid to generate statistics at the national level. Overall, this\ninformation shall help ONC interpret the results and allow us to assess the degree to which the\ndata are complete.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters opposed our proposal in § 170.407(b)(1)(i) for the first\nInsights Condition reporting period to begin in April 2024. Some commenters stated the timeline\nwas unrealistic, not feasible, or impossible given timeframes to develop, deploy, test, and build\nthe capability to compile the data. Commenters offered various alternative timelines for the first\nInsights Condition reporting period to begin. Several commenters requested delaying the first\nreporting period to begin in calendar year 2025, such as in January, April, or October of 2025.\n\nSeveral commenters requested delaying the first reporting period to begin in calendar year 2026.\n\nSome commenters requested delaying the first reporting period to begin 18 months after the final\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrule publication. One commenter requested ONC reconsider implementation over a four- or five-\nyear timeframe. One commenter suggested longer timelines to ensure measures are validated\nbefore phasing in new measures.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback and have revised the Insights\nCondition timelines. We have finalized in § 170.407(b)(1)(i) to delay the first reporting period to\nallow developers of certified health IT adequate time to develop and implement the Insights\nCondition measures and related metrics. We have finalized that the first data collection period\nwill be January to December 2026, followed by the submission of the first phase of measures and\nrelated metrics due in July of 2027. This represents “year one” of the Insights Condition\nrequirements. Reporting is on an annual basis thereafter. We have further extended our phased\napproach to measure requirements, including layering complexity associated with certain\nmeasures over the course of three years, so that certain measures (and related metrics) start in\nyear one, while other measures or stratifications to existing measures begin in subsequent years.\n\nWe have finalized “year 2” measures and related metrics start data collection in calendar year\n2027, with responses due in July 2028, and annually thereafter. Finally, we have finalized “year\n3” measures and related metrics start data collection in calendar year 2028, with responses due in\nJuly 2029 and annually thereafter. The phasing of the measures and related metrics are illustrated\nin the table in this section of the preamble.\n\nWe also appreciate the commenter’s concern for needing additional time to assess\nmeasure validity. Our revised approach of phasing in more complex aspects of each of the\nmeasures enables reviewing baseline measures before adding complexity. Furthermore, our\nrevised approach provides additional time for measure development and implementation and will\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallow us to apply lessons learned from the smaller set of measures to inform the implementation\nof next set.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters opposed our proposal in § 170.407(b)(1) to require the\nfrequency of semiannual (i.e., every six months) data collection and reporting under the Insights\nCondition. Most commenters suggested an annual frequency of data collection and reporting to\nreduce burden. Many of these commenters suggested using a calendar-year reporting period with\nreporting to occur mid-year to better align with the CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs\nand the Real World Testing Condition, and to avoid other April/October requirements for\nAttestations submissions. One health system commenter suggested an annual reporting period\nthat does not overlap with clinical quality measure reporting schedules. One commenter stated\nthat semiannual reporting would require two product upgrades within a one-year timeframe and\nthat their customers would not be willing to comply. Three commenters supported our proposal\nto require semiannual (i.e., every six months) data collection and reporting in April and October.\n\nOne health IT developer commented the proposed six-month intervals are feasible with current\ntechnology and not overly burdensome to health IT developers. Commenters supported our\nproposal in § 170.407(b)(1) for six months to assemble and assess data collected prior to\nreporting under the Insights Condition.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback on reporting frequency and the concerns expressed\nrelated to burden. To address these concerns, we have finalized to reduce the reporting frequency\nto annually (once per year) in § 170.407(b), on a calendar year cycle, with data collection to be\ncompleted from January to December. We have maintained the six-month data assembly period,\nsuch that reports for a given calendar year will be due to be submitted in July of the following\ncalendar year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters requested clarification on whether developers of certified\nhealth IT have the flexibility to reuse the Insights Condition reporting measurements and outputs\nfor their Real World Testing plans and results.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters request for clarity. We appreciate that the data\ncollected related to the Insights Condition and Real World Testing could overlap. Therefore,\ndevelopers of certified health IT can choose to repurpose the Insights Condition reporting\nmeasurements and/or data as part of their Real World Testing plans and results.\n\n*Comments.* One health IT developer suggested that ONC apply its experience with Real\nWorld Testing to reduce measure ambiguity and provide Real World Testing reports as examples\nfor health IT developers to use in planning for the Insights Condition.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenter that the Real World Testing Condition provides\nrelevant experience for health IT developers. We considered Real World Testing Condition\nreports in developing our proposals for the Insights Condition and intend to provide examples.\n\nWe plan to leverage a system linked to the CHPL for reporting to make the process similar to\nother certification related processes. We will use web-based forms within that system for\nsubmission and plan to provide templates for health IT developers to use in their data submission\nfor the Insights Condition. The templates will enable health IT developers to submit the data (as\nnoted in the 88 FR 23847) in a machine-readable format, such as JavaScript Object Notation\n(JSON). We also intend to provide educational sessions and resources for health IT developers to\nsupport electronic reporting of the metrics and related documentation.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters recommended that ONC expand its governance structure\nto include patients and other clinicians in reviewing Insights Condition and Real World Testing\nresults to identify new opportunities for action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for the input. As described in our HTI-1 Proposed\nRule, ONC, and our contractor, conducted various engagement efforts with a variety of groups\nhaving potential interests in the Insights Condition. This engagement process219\nincluded a\nrequest for information by ONC, public forums, listening sessions, and discussions with experts\nand key groups, including health IT end users (e.g., clinicians) and health IT developers. In\naddition to this engagement and public comments, the Health IT Advisory Committee (HITAC),\nwhich includes patient advocates and clinicians, provided recommendations220\nto ONC that\ninformed the Insights Condition. We will continue to look for opportunities to obtain input from\na variety of perspectives, including patients and clinicians, on the Insights Condition.\n\n*Comments.* One health care provider organization recommended that ONC make the\nInsights Condition metrics easily accessible to users of certified health IT and to the public. One\nhealth IT developer sought clarification from ONC if we intend to calculate and display\npercentages using the reported numerators and denominators across the universe of certified\nhealth IT that reported for a given measure, or if we intend to calculate and display metrics at the\ndeveloper or product level. Another commenter encouraged ONC and developers of certified\nhealth IT under the Insights Condition to evaluate measure reliability and validity of the reported\ndata before publicly reporting.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for the opportunity to clarify how ONC will calculate\nand display the Insights Condition metrics. In accordance with the Cures Act, we intend to make\n\n\nFootnote 219:\nhttps://www.urban.org/research/publication/what-comparative-information-needed-ehr-reporting-program\n\n\nFootnote 220:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2022-07/2021-09-\n09_EHRRP_TF_2021__HITAC%20Recommendations_Report_signed_508_Edit.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresponses (the metrics and required documentation) to the Insights Condition publicly available\non an ONC website. Prior to publicly releasing the data or publishing metrics, we will review\nand analyze the data to assess completeness and generalizability, which relate to the reliability\nand validity of the data. After this analysis, we will determine what level(s) the calculated\nmetrics would be displayed, such as at the product, developer and/or national level.

              "text": "Health IT Certification Program including Real-Time Prescription Benefit Capabilities\nSection 119 of Title I, Division CC of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, (Pub.\n\nL. 116-260) (CAA), requires PDP sponsors of prescription drug plans to implement one or more\nreal-time benefit tools (RTBTs) after the Secretary has adopted a standard for RTBTs and at a\ntime determined appropriate by the Secretary. The law specified that a qualifying RTBT must\nmeet technical standards named by the Secretary, in consultation with ONC. Section 119(b)(3)\nalso amended the definition of a “qualified electronic health record” in section 3000(13) of the\nPHSA to specify that a qualified electronic health record must include or be capable of including\nan RTBT. In the 2014 Edition Final Rule, ONC established the term “Base EHR,” based on the\n“Qualified EHR” definition, for use within the Program (77 FR 54262).\n\nAs stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23848), we intend to propose in future\nrulemaking the establishment of a real-time prescription benefit health IT certification criterion\nwithin the Program and include this criterion in the Base EHR definition in § 170.102. We intend\nto propose a criterion that would certify health IT to enable a provider to view within the\nelectronic prescribing workflow at the point of care patient-specific benefit, estimated cost\ninformation, and viable alternatives. We are also considering a proposal to adopt and reference\nthe National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Real-Time Prescription Benefit\n(RTPB) standard version 12 as part of the potential certification criterion.<sup>221</sup>\nThis standard would\nenable the exchange of patient eligibility, product coverage, and benefit financials for a chosen\nproduct and pharmacy, and identify coverage restrictions and alternatives when they exist.\n\n\nFootnote 221:\nFor further information about implementing the NCPDP RTPB standard version 12, see resources at\nhttps://standards.ncpdp.org/Access-to-Standards.aspx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we believe that implementing RTBT functionality required for inclusion in the\nProgram under the CAA would be an important step towards improving prescribing experiences\nfor providers and patients, we recognize that it is only one of a series of capabilities that are part\nof a comprehensive workflow for evaluating and prescribing medications (88 FR 23849).\n\nToday, the Program addresses these additional capabilities in a limited manner. For\ninstance, in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, ONC adopted NCPDP SCRIPT standard version\n2017071 and updated the “electronic prescribing” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(3)(ii) to\nreflect this standard, including specifying electronic prior authorization transactions supported by\nthe standard as optional transactions, which health IT developers can elect to have explicitly\ntested, or not, as part of certification of a product to § 170.315(b)(3) (85 FR 25680).\n\nA “drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” certification criterion had been\nestablished for the 2015 Edition in § 170.315(a)(10) but was later removed from the Program by\nthe ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25660). ONC removed the criterion due to the lack of\nassociated interoperability standards and to reduce certification burden on developers as this\nfunctionality had been widely adopted across industry.\n\nWe requested comment in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23849) from the public about\nspecific issues related to establishing a certification criterion using NCPDP RTPB standard\nversion 12 and other potential actions that could support complementary and interoperable\nworkflows. Given the statutory definition in PHSA § 3000(13) of “qualified electronic health\nrecord” as an electronic record of health-related information on an individual that includes, or is\ncapable of including, RTBT functionality, we sought to understand whether ONC should offer or\nrequire certification of other capabilities to optimize the value of real-time prescription benefit\ncapabilities to clinicians and patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe requested input on how developers of certified health IT may be able to support drug\nprice transparency, patient choice, and meet other market demands while ensuring reliable and\ntrusted performance. We received many insightful comments on this RFI. We appreciate the\ninput provided by commenters and may consider their input to inform a future rulemaking.\n\n\n",

We proposed (as discussed\nin IV.B.3 of this preamble) to remove reference to the period of time, now passed, from the\nexception in 45 CFR 171.301. We proposed, consequently, to rename the “Content and Manner\n\n\n\n\n\n\nException” to simply the “Manner Exception.” Each of these proposals is discussed, and public\ncomments received on each proposal summarized, in section IV.B of this preamble.\n\nWe proposed enhancements to certain information blocking exceptions that had been\nestablished by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642). We proposed to clarify the\nuncontrollable events condition of the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204) to make it clear that an\nuncontrollable event must in fact have affected the actor’s ability to fulfill requests for access,\nexchange, or use of EHI (for a more detailed summary, please see section IV.C.1.a of this\npreamble). We also proposed to create new conditions for (options through which to satisfy) the\nInfeasibility Exception when an actor has exhausted the § 171.301 Manner Exception and,\nseparately, when a third party requests to modify EHI held by the actor. These conditions are\ndiscussed in sections IV.C.1.b and IV.C.1.c of this preamble. As discussed in section IV.C.2 of\nthis preamble, we proposed to add a TEFCA manner condition to the proposed revised and\nrenamed Manner Exception codified in 45 CFR 171.301 (see 88 FR 23872 through 23873).\n\nThe HTI-1 Proposed Rule included (at 88 FR 23873 through 88 FR 23876) three\ninformation blocking requests for information (RFIs).

Some\ncommenters made suggestions, recommendations, or requests for additional guidance,\ninformation and educational resources, or for other tools to help actors appropriately share\ninformation and avoid conduct that would be considered “information blocking” (as defined in\n45 CFR 171.103).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters. We include below\nadditional explanation of provisions of this final rule. Requests, recommendations, or\nsuggestions that we provide additional guidance, resources, or tools relevant to information\nblocking are appreciated. As part of our ongoing outreach and education efforts, all feedback and\ninformation we receive helps to inform our consideration and development of resources such as\nwebinar presentations, fact sheets, and frequently asked questions (FAQs).\n\n*Comments.* Several comments advocated for specific changes to the information blocking\nregulations, to other HHS regulations, or to state law. For example, a commenter advocated\n“aligning HIPAA rules, 42 CFR part 2 requirements, and other state and federal laws with\ninformation blocking regulations.” Another commenter stated that “ONC needs to clarify the\nnational requirements for production of complete medical records, especially absolute\ntransparency on corrections, deletions, delayed entries, and original content, upon ordinary\nrequest.” A commenter indicated health IT users may mis-apply the designated record set (DRS)\ndefinition to electronic records and stated that ONC “needs to consider discouraging\ninappropriate DRS definition-based information blocking of complete medical records through\nsignificant, powerful disincentives.” One commenter advocated for ONC to narrow the health\ninformation network definition “and clearly state in the regulatory text payers are not included in\nthis definition and thus are not subject to the information blocking provision.” Another\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenter expressed a view that specifying in the information blocking definition’s regulatory\ntext the persons whose records access can be affected by a practice would make the rule stronger.\n\n*Response.* Comments related to the following are outside of the scope of the information\nblocking provisions of this rulemaking: establishment of health care provider disincentives for\ninformation blocking conduct; changes to HHS regulations outside 45 CFR part 171; adoption of\nrequirements for creation or retention of specific metadata by all health care providers\nnationwide; and any change to any state or tribal law. However, comments recommending policy\nchanges outside the scope of this rule are part of the rulemaking record, and we may refer to\nthem as an information source when assessing potential future rulemaking or outreach and\neducation activities.\n\n*Comments.* A substantial number of comments expressed concerns about a perceived\nconflict between the goals of maximizing information sharing and appropriately protecting\npatients’ privacy interests. These comments generally associated these concerns with specific\npolicy recommendations, including the creation of new information blocking exception(s). Some\ncommenters suggested that some § 171.102 actors may believe they have no option under\ninformation blocking regulations but to enable the access, exchange, or use of all EHI in all\nsituations — including those where only some of the EHI can be used or disclosed consistent\nwith privacy laws or the patient’s individual privacy preferences. A few of these commenters\nspecifically noted sensitive information or information associated with sensitive types of care,\nsuch as reproductive or behavioral health care.\n\n*Response.* Some of the policy recommendations that commenters offered to address these\nconcerns, such as to establish new exceptions or implement revisions beyond anything described\nin the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, were outside the scope of this rulemaking. Some provisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadvocated by commenters appear to duplicate provisions already in place, such as provisions of\nthe Privacy Exception (§ 171.202) and the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204). The expressed\nconcerns and advocacy of duplicative policy provisions suggest it may be helpful to highlight\nhere certain aspects of how the information blocking regulations currently operate.\n\nWhere applicable law prohibits a specific access, exchange, or use of information, the\ninformation blocking regulations consider the practice of complying with such laws to be\n“required by law.” Practices that are “required by law” are not considered “information\nblocking” (see the statutory information blocking definition in section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA\nand the discussion in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25794). For example, when the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity or business associate from disclosing PHI, an\nactor who is also a covered entity or business associate can comply fully with the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule without implicating the information blocking regulations. For another example, a\n§ 171.102 actor subject to a state or tribal law that expressly prohibits a certain access, exchange,\nor use of EHI can comply fully with that state or tribal law without implicating the information\nblocking regulations.\n\nWe recognize that even where federal, state, or tribal law does not expressly prohibit the\nactor from fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI, or require an actor to engage in\nparticular privacy-protective practices, an actor may nevertheless wish to engage in practices\nlikely to interfere with access, exchange, or use in order to honor their patients’ privacy\npreferences. Actors covered by the information blocking regulations—health IT developers of\ncertified health IT, health information networks or health information exchanges (HIN/HIEs),\nand health care providers—may seek certainty that the privacy-protective practices that are not\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequired of them by law, but in which they choose to engage, will not meet the definition of\ninformation blocking.\n\nIn the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we established the Privacy Exception (45 CFR\n171.202) to ensure that actors can engage in reasonable and necessary practices that advance the\nprivacy interests of individuals (see 85 FR 25845 through 25859) without committing\n“information blocking” as defined in section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA and 45 CFR 171.103.\n\nFor example, the information blocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171 accommodate the\nfact that, in various circumstances, other applicable law (federal, state, or tribal) does not permit\nEHI to be used or disclosed unless certain preconditions are met. The Precondition Not Satisfied\n(45 CFR 171.202(b)) sub-exception of the Privacy Exception outlines a framework for actors to\nfollow to be assured their practices of not fulfilling requests to access, exchange, or use EHI will\nnot constitute information blocking when a precondition of applicable state, tribal, or federal law\nhas not been satisfied.\n\nIn addition, for purposes of the Precondition Not Satisfied sub-exception, an actor\noperating under multiple state laws, or state and tribal laws, with inconsistent preconditions for\nEHI disclosures may choose to adopt uniform policies and procedures to address the more\nrestrictive preconditions (45 CFR 171.202(b)(3)).\n\nExamples that highlight the alignment between the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the\ninformation blocking regulations are included in the “HIPAA Privacy Rule and Disclosures of\nInformation Relating to Reproductive Health Care” guidance issued by the Office for Civil\nRights. As outlined in this guidance, there are certain preconditions that must be met before\ndisclosures about reproductive health care can be made by health care provider workforce\nmembers, including to law enforcement officials. For instance, if a law enforcement official\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequests records of abortions from a reproductive health care clinic: “If the request is not\naccompanied by a court order or other mandate enforceable in a court of law, the Privacy Rule\nwould not permit the clinic to disclose PHI in response to the request. Therefore, such a\ndisclosure would be impermissible and constitute a breach of unsecured PHI requiring\nnotification to HHS and the individual affected.” In this example, federal law does not permit the\ndisclosure of EHI unless certain requirements are met, and therefore, the actor’s practice not to\ndisclose EHI would not be information blocking. We note that this is just one example of how\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule gives individuals confidence that their protected health information,\nincluding information relating to abortion and other sexual and reproductive health care, will be\nkept private. Please see the guidance from the Office for Civil Rights for additional information\nand examples.<sup>222</sup>\nWe also note that information blocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171 accommodate an\nactor, if they so choose, agreeing to an individual’s request for restrictions on sharing of the\nindividual’s EHI beyond the restrictions imposed by applicable law(s). Specifically, where the\nrequirements specified in 45 CFR 171.202(e) are met, the Respecting an Individual’s Request\nNot to Share Information (§ 171.202(e)) sub-exception of the Privacy Exception applies to an\nactor’s practice of honoring an individual’s request not to provide access, exchange, or use of the\nindividual’s EHI. This aligns with the individual’s right to request a restriction on certain uses\nand disclosures of their PHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)), to which an\nactor that is a covered entity may choose to agree but is not required by the HIPAA Privacy\nRule to agree.\n\n\nFootnote 222:\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/phi-reproductive-health/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn scenarios where a § 171.102 actor that is also subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule must\nagree to the request of an individual to restrict disclosure of PHI as provided in 45 CFR\n164.522(a)(1)(vi), the actor’s practice of agreeing to the request and complying with all\nrequirements of 45 CFR 164.522 applicable to such requests and restrictions is, in our view, a\npractice that is “required by law.” We reiterate that practices that are required by law are\nexcluded from the statutory (PHSA section 3022(a)(1)) as well as the regulatory (45 CFR\n171.103) definition of information blocking without needing to also satisfy any of the 45 CFR\npart 171 exceptions. Therefore, when a § 171.102 actor that is also a HIPAA covered entity\nengages in a practice of complying with all requirements of 45 CFR 164.522 that are applicable\nto requests to which a covered entity must agree (as provided in 45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)(vi)) then\nthat actor would not need to also satisfy the Respecting an Individual’s Request Not to Share\nInformation (45 CFR 171.202(e)) sub-exception of the Privacy Exception in order for that\npractice to not be considered information blocking. The practice would be excluded from the\ndefinition of information blocking because it would be “required by law” and, therefore, an\ninformation blocking exception for the practice would not be needed.\n\nWe refer commenters and other readers interested in learning more about the interaction\nof the information blocking regulations with the HIPAA Rules and other laws protecting\nindividuals’ privacy interests to the discussion of the Privacy Exception in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25642, 85 FR 25845 through 25859). We also highlight the availability of\nadditional resources through our website (start at: https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-\nblocking). Resources focused on how the information blocking rules work in harmony with\nprivacy laws include, for example, an ONC Health IT buzz blog post titled “Information\nBlocking Regulations Work in Concert with HIPAA Rules and Other Privacy Laws to Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Information Privacy”<sup>223</sup>\nand the following three frequently asked questions (FAQs)\nhighlighting how information blocking regulations work in tandem with the HIPAA Privacy\nRule and other privacy protective laws:\n• Would it be information blocking if an actor does not fulfill a request to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in order to comply with federal privacy laws that require certain\nconditions to have been met prior to disclosure?<sup>224</sup>\n• If an actor, such as a health care provider, operates in more than one state, is it consistent\nwith the information blocking regulations for the health care provider to implement\npractices to uniformly follow the state law that is the most privacy protective (more\nrestrictive) across all the other states in which it operates? <sup>225</sup>\n• If an individual requests that their EHI not be disclosed, is it information blocking if an\nactor does not disclose the EHI based on the individual’s request?<sup>226</sup>\nThe Infeasibility Exception may also be applicable to matters of patient privacy\npreferences. Established by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, the Infeasibility Exception (45 CFR\n171.204) applies when an actor’s practice meets one of the conditions set forth in § 171.204(a)\nand also meets the condition in § 171.204(b) (see 85 FR 25958, see also preamble discussion at\n85 FR 25866 through 25870). The segmentation condition of the Infeasibility Exception\n(§ 171.204(a)(2)) can be met in conjunction with other exceptions to provide actors assurance\n\n\nFootnote 223:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-\nwith-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy (Retrieved 7/12/2023)\n\n\nFootnote 224:\nInformation blocking FAQ identifier: IB.FAQ48.1.2023APR.

(Retrieved 7/12/2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat their practice does not constitute information blocking. The segmentation condition is\napplicable when the actor cannot fulfill the request for access, exchange, or use of EHI because\nthe actor cannot unambiguously segment the requested EHI from EHI that:\n• cannot be made available due to the individual’s preference (such as where the individual\nhas requested that the EHI not be shared with a specific person(s), for a specific\npurpose(s), or both);<sup>227</sup>\n• cannot be made available by law, for example, the HIPAA Privacy Rule, other federal\nlaw, or applicable state or tribal law does not permit the EHI to be made available to the\nperson seeking it, for the purpose it is sought, or both; or\n• may be withheld in accordance with the Preventing Harm Exception (45 CFR 171.201).\n\nApplicable law may restrict providing certain types of EHI to a person or class of\npersons, for a specific purpose, or a combination of types of persons and specific purposes. For\nexample, federal, state, or tribal law may require that certain information not be accessed, used,\nor exchanged by the person seeking it, for the purpose it is sought, or both. As we discuss above,\nan actor can, without engaging in “information blocking,” withhold information as required by\nlaw or withhold information by meeting the Pre-condition Not Satisfied sub-exception.\n\nSimilarly, an individual (see definition of “individual” in § 171.202(a)) may express a preference\nthat some or all of the EHI for a particular patient not be shared with a specific person(s), for a\nspecific purpose(s), or a specific combination of person(s) and purpose(s). Such a preference\ncould be expressed, for example, by the individual making a request that a HIPAA covered entity\nrestrict uses and disclosures of their PHI that § 164.522 requires covered entities to permit an\n\n\nFootnote 227:\nWe use “individual” here, and for purposes of § 171.204 in general, as it is defined in § 171.202(a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindividual to make. As we discuss above, and in accordance with the § 171.202(e) Respecting an\nIndividual’s Request Not to Share Information sub-exception, an actor may withhold information\nthat a patient has requested the actor not share.\n\nThe example above illustrates a specific alignment between the information blocking\nregulations and HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, the § 171.202(e) sub-exception’s alignment with\nthe individual’s right under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to request restrictions does not limit the\nsub-exception’s availability to actors who are also subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s\nrequirements. Nothing in the § 171.202(e) sub-exception limits its availability based on whether\nthe actor is a HIPAA covered entity or business associate that must comply with the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule. Likewise, § 171.202(e) does not focus on whether the individual requested\nrestrictions under any specific provision of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, for purposes of\nthe information blocking regulations, the § 171.202(e) Respecting an Individual’s Request Not to\nShare Information sub-exception can be satisfied by any actor who chooses to meet the\nrequirements of the sub-exception.\n\nWe recognize many actors may currently be unable to unambiguously segment\nreproductive health and behavioral health information indicated by some commenters on the\ninformation blocking provisions as sensitive information, as well as gender-affirming care\ninformation, from other EHI. These are also examples of types of information for which\nindividuals may be likely to request restrictions on uses or disclosure. These are, however, not\nthe only types of information to which the Infeasibility Exception’s segmentation condition\nmight apply. As we noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, a health care provider might choose to\nhonor a patient's request for restrictions on sharing of their EHI even if the provider did not know\nthe patient's specific reasons for the request. The Respecting An Individual’s Request Not To\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Information sub-exception (§ 171.202(e)) does not specify that the individual requesting\nrestrictions should have particular reasons for requesting restrictions, or be required to share their\nreasoning with the health care provider or other actor of whom they make the request (88 FR\n23874).\n\nWhere an actor engaging in a practice that is not (or practices that are not) fully covered\nby a single exception seeks certainty that such practices do not constitute information blocking,\nthe actor could choose to satisfy several applicable exceptions that, in complement, do fully\ncover their practices. Applicable exceptions, and combinations of exceptions, will vary based on\nthe actor’s specific practice and particular facts and circumstances in which they engage and the\npractices for which the actor seeks the certainty offered by information blocking exceptions. <sup>228</sup>\nIn various circumstances, an actor may wish to engage in one or more practice(s) that are\ncovered in part, but not fully covered, by the Privacy Exception (§ 171.202) or the Preventing\nHarm Exception (§ 171.201). In some of these situations, such an actor may want to consider the\npotential certainty that could be available by satisfying a combination of the Infeasibility\nException (§ 171.204) with the Privacy Exception (§ 171.202) or with the Preventing Harm\nException (§ 171.201), or any combination of multiple exceptions applicable to the specific\npractice in which the actor engages. We provide the following example to illustrate how the use\nof a combination of exceptions might occur. We note that we have intentionally omitted from\nthis example any consideration of why the individual may request, or why the actor may have\n\n\nFootnote 228:\nIt is important to remember that the information blocking exceptions defined in 45 CFR part 171 subparts B and\nC are voluntary, offering actors certainty that any practice meeting the conditions of one or more exceptions would\nnot be considered information blocking. An actor’s practice that does not meet the conditions of an exception would\nnot automatically constitute information blocking. See, e.g., IB.FAQ29.1.2020NOV, URL:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/faq/if-actor-does-not-fulfill-request-access-exchange-and-use-ehi-any-manner-requested-\nthey-have. (Retrieved 7/12/2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchosen to agree to the individual’s request. This is because the § 171.202(e) sub-exception’s\napplication is not limited based on what particular reasons an individual may have for requesting\nrestrictions of any or all of their EHI, and does not specify that an actor must have specific\nreasons for choosing to grant rather than deny an individual’s request for restrictions. However,\nas noted above, these exceptions could be exercised, separately or together, when an individual\nrequests certain information (e.g., reproductive health, behavioral health, or gender-affirming\ncare information) not be shared or when such information cannot be unambiguously segmented\nfrom other EHI from the reasons noted above.\n\nAn individual makes a request of an actor not to share certain EHI. The actor agrees to\nthe request, documents the request, implements the request, and does not otherwise terminate the\nrequest. After the actor agrees to the individual’s request not to share information, the actor\nreceives a request for the individual’s EHI that encompasses information the individual requested\nthat the actor not share. The actor determines that responding to the request is not prohibited by\napplicable law. The actor then determines that the actor has the technical ability to segment out\nsome, but not all, of the requested EHI from the EHI subject to the individual’s request not to\nshare. The actor notifies the requestor in writing in 10 business days from the receipt of the\nrequest that the actor cannot unambiguously segment the EHI from the EHI that the actor cannot\nshare for reasons consistent with the § 171.204(a)(2) segmentation condition. The actor provides\nthe requestor with EHI the actor can unambiguously segment from the EHI that is subject to the\nindividual’s request, and the actor does not provide the requester with certain EHI that the actor\ncannot unambiguously segment from the EHI subject to the individual’s request.\n\n• For purposes of this example, the actor has two exceptions available. First, the actor has\nreceived an individual’s request not to share information, elected to grant the individual’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequested restriction on access, exchange, or use of EHI, and met the requirements of the\n§ 171.202(e) Respecting an Individual’s Request Not to Share Information sub-exception\nof the Privacy Exception. (Note: for purposes of the § 171.202(e) Respecting an\nIndividual’s Request Not to Share Information sub-exception, an actor (such as a health\nIT developer of certified health IT) who maintains or manages EHI on behalf of another\nentity (such as a health care provider)<sup>229</sup>\ncan rely on the other entity’s practice that meets\nthe sub-exception’s requirements; the individual need not make a duplicative request for\nEHI sharing restrictions directly to the actor who is maintaining or managing EHI on\nbehalf of the other entity.) Because the actor met the requirements of that sub-exception,\nthe actor’s practice of not providing the requested EHI that cannot be made available due\nto the individual’s request would not constitute information blocking.\n\n• Second, the actor cannot unambiguously segment certain EHI from the EHI that would\nnot be made available due to the individual’s request that the actor has agreed to honor.\n\nThe Infeasibility Exception is satisfied by a practice that meets a condition in paragraph\n(a) of § 171.204, such as the segmentation condition (171.204(a)(2)) and the responding\nto requests condition in § 171.204(b). Meeting the § 171.204(b) condition does not\nrequire that an actor fulfill any EHI in response to any request but does require that the\nactor provide the requestor within 10 business days of receipt of the request, in writing,\nthe reason(s) the request is infeasible. Thus, the actor in this example would satisfy the\nInfeasibility Exception for that portion of EHI that cannot be unambiguously segmented\nfrom EHI that cannot be made available due to the individual’s request that the actor has\n\n\nFootnote 229:\n“Entity” as used in this paragraph could be an individual (such as a licensed health care professional) or an\norganization (such as a health care facility).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagreed to honor. In this example, no other exceptions apply to the EHI that the actor can\nunambiguously segment from the EHI that cannot be shared because the actor has agreed\nto the individual’s request not to share certain EHI. The actor, therefore, provides the EHI\nthat can be unambiguously segmented and is not subject to the individual’s request not to\nshare information in response to the request. If the actor did not provide the EHI that can\nbe unambiguously segmented, then the actor might be engaged in information blocking\nwith respect to the EHI that can be unambiguously segmented.\n\nWe note that this is only one example to illustrate how the “stacking” of exceptions may\noccur. We have chosen to detail here an example scenario where an individual has requested\nrestrictions to reinforce actors’ and individuals’ awareness of the § 171.202(e) sub-exception and\nto emphasize that the information blocking regulations accommodate actors’ choosing to respect\nan individual’s request for restrictions on EHI about the individual. We emphasize, however, that\nthere may be a wide variety of scenarios where “stacking” other combinations of various\nexceptions with one another, or with restrictions on use or disclosure of EHI under applicable\nlaw, may occur.\n\nAgain, we refer actors and other persons interested in learning more about how the\ninformation blocking regulations, and particularly the exceptions, work in concert with the\nHIPAA Rules and other privacy laws to support health information privacy, to the blog post<sup>230</sup>\nas\nwell as the frequently asked questions referenced and linked above.\n\n\nFootnote 230:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/information-blocking/information-blocking-regulations-work-in-concert-\nwith-hipaa-rules-and-other-privacy-laws-to-support-health-information-privacy (Retrieved 12/07/2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will issue additional guidance as needed and intend to propose additional exceptions\nin future rulemaking to further support health information privacy, including for information that\npatients may view as particularly sensitive such as reproductive health-related information.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter expressed concern about the applicability of information\nblocking regulations where there are data interoperability problems resulting from different\nimplementations of standards by different EHR vendors.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their input.

The ONC acknowledges the challenge of balancing information sharing with privacy protection, especially for sensitive health information. The rule accommodates actors who respect patients' requests for privacy beyond what the law requires. It also provides a framework for actors to follow when legal preconditions for sharing EHI are not met.

As offerors of certified health IT, these individuals or entities could engage in\nconduct that constitutes information blocking as defined in § 171.103, such as through\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontractual terms or practices undertaken in operating and maintaining health IT deployed by or\nfor another individual or entity.\n\nAs discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23858), we proposed to codify in\n§ 171.102 a definition of what it means to offer certified health IT. As proposed, the definition\nwould provide clarity about the implications under information blocking regulations of making\navailable funding subsidies and certain features or uses of certified health IT as well as engaging\nin certain other conduct (as discussed in more detail below). Specifically, we proposed to define\nthe term “offer health information technology” or “offer health IT.” For ease of reference, in this\npreamble, we will generally use the shorter version of the term, “offer health IT” when\ndiscussing or referencing the definition. In light of our proposal to establish the “offer health IT”\ndefinition, we also proposed (see 88 FR 23915 and 88 FR 23864) to update the wording of the\n“health IT developer of certified health IT” definition specific to the exclusion of certain self-\ndeveloper health care providers. The proposal specific to the “health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT” definition is summarized and discussed in section IV.B.2 below.\n\nAs explained at 88 FR 23858 through 23859, the definition we proposed for offer health\nIT generally includes providing, supplying, or holding out for potential provision or supply,\ncertified health IT under any arrangement or terms, but explicitly excludes arrangements and\nactivities specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the offer health IT definition (which are discussed\nin detail in section IV.B.1.a and b, below). We proposed exclusions of certain arrangements and\nactivities from the offer health IT definition to serve two primary purposes:\n(1) to encourage certain beneficial arrangements under which providers in need can\nreceive subsidies for the cost of obtaining, maintaining, or upgrading certified health IT; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) to give health care providers (and others) who use certified health IT concrete\ncertainty that implementing certain health IT features and functionalities, as well as engaging in\ncertain practices that are common and beneficial in an EHR-enabled healthcare environment,\nwill not be considered an offering of certified health IT (regardless of who developed that health\nIT).\n\nWe also proposed (in paragraph (3) of the offer health IT definition in § 171.102) to\nexclude from the offer health IT definition the furnishing of certain legal, health IT expert\nconsulting, or management consulting services to health care providers or others who obtain and\nuse health IT. The paragraph (3) consulting and legal services exclusion is discussed in detail in\nsection IV.B.1.c, below.\n\nThe HTI-1 Proposed Rule included examples illustrating when certain arrangements or\nactivities would or would not fall within a proposed exclusion (paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)), and\nclarified that if any individual or entity that engages in some conduct consistent with an\nexclusion from the offer health IT definition but also engages in other conduct that meets the\ndefinition of offer health IT, that individual or entity would be considered a health IT developer\nof certified health IT. We noted that once an entity meets the definition of health IT developer of\ncertified health IT based on any of its conduct, that definition will apply to all practices of the\nentity.<sup>231</sup>\n(see 88 FR 23860 through 23864).\n\n*Comments.* More than thirty commenters’ submissions included comments on the offer\nhealth IT definition, health IT developer of certified health IT definition, or both definitions. Of\n\n\nFootnote 231:\nBecause we are aware that health care provider organizations may be, have, or include one or more physician or\nother clinicians’ professional practices, we note for readers’ clarity that unless otherwise specified (such as by being\npreceded by “clinician” or “office”), we use the word “practice” throughout the section IV of this preamble with the\nmeaning it has in 45 CFR 171.102 (i.e., “an act or omission by an actor”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthese, over a dozen expressed general support and none expressed general opposition to the\nproposals.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all commenters’ feedback. We have finalized the proposed offer\nhealth IT definition with one revision to the wording to replace “for use by” with “for\ndeployment by or for” other individual(s) and entity(ies). Our response to the comments\nsummarized immediately below explains why we believe this finalized wording change\nimproves clarity of the definition for actors and other interested parties.\n\n*Comments.* With a reference to the exclusion proposed in paragraph (2) of the offer\nhealth IT definition in § 171.102, the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee\n(HITAC) recommended that we clarify that providing access to registries and similar data\nservices provided by public health authorities is not considered providing health IT, regardless of\nthe route used to request/access/receive data (e.g., through direct logon to a public health\ninformation system, via an app or third-party tool, or via HIN/HIE). The recommendation’s\nrationale was stated as: “This change is necessary to provide users the flexibility to connect to\nthe data resource in the manner of the user's choosing.” Other comments requested that we\nexplicitly exclude, or clarify whether the offer health IT definition excludes, an actor making\nEHI available through an API or enabling interaction with an API. Commenters also requested\nclarification on whether such an API-related exclusion would apply to specific types of\nindividuals or entities, or to specific purposes.\n\n*Response.* Although focused on the detail of the exclusion proposed in paragraph (2) of\nthe offer health IT definition in § 171.102, HITAC’s comment informed our review of the\ninteraction between the wording of the proposed offer health IT definition and the distinction\nbetween the roles of API User and API Information Source, as we had already defined these\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroles in § 170.404(c) and (by cross-reference) § 171.102. Specifically, we believe that wording\nthe offer health IT definition in § 171.102 to focus (as proposed, see 88 FR 23915) on holding\nout or providing or supplying under any arrangement certified health IT “for use by” others may\nbe a source of uncertainty for health care providers, and for others who deploy Certified API\nTechnology in the role of an API Information Source. This uncertainty, we believe, relates to the\nimplications for purposes of the offer health IT definition of a health care provider or other\nindividual or entity in the role of an API Information Source making Certified API Technology\navailable to individuals and entities (other than their own employees and contractors) in the role\nof API User.\n\nAt this point, a brief review of the distinction between our definitions of the API User\nand API Information Source roles, with reference to their establishment in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25748 through 25749), may help to explain why we now believe clarity is\nimproved by aligning the wording of the offer health IT definition with those two definitions. In\nthe ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized in § 170.404(c) definitions of API User and API\nInformation Source for purposes of the ONC Health IT Certification Program, and by cross-\nreference to § 170.404(c) adopted those same definitions for purposes of the information\nblocking regulations in 45 CFR part 171. As discussed in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule at 85\nFR 25748 through 25749, we received in response to the ONC Cures Act Proposed Rule (see 84\nFR 7477 for preamble discussion, 84 FR 7588 for proposed definitions) comments requesting a\ndefinition of a “First-Order User” (to include patients, health care providers, and payers that use\napps/services) and a definition of a “Third-Party Users” (to include third-party software\ndevelopers, and developers of software applications used by “API Data Providers”). We decided,\nas explained in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25748 through 25749), that such a\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndistinction was unnecessary from a regulatory perspective, and we finalized the API User\ndefinition in § 170.404(c) (85 FR 25948) as “a person or entity that creates or uses software\napplications that interact with the ‘certified API technology’ developed by a ‘Certified API\nDeveloper’ and deployed by an ‘API Information Source.’” We also defined an API Information\nSource as an organization that deploys certified API technology created by a Certified API\nDeveloper. We noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that the definitions finalized in\n§ 170.404(c) were created to describe relationships and to help describe the Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements to which developers participating in the ONC Health\nIT Certification Program are subject (85 FR 25749).<sup>232</sup>\nA vast array of interoperable health IT items and services are designed and implemented\nspecifically to achieve increasingly efficient access, exchange, and use of EHI for a wide range\nof permissible purposes. Thus, in an interoperable health IT ecosystem, one may see third-party\napps adopted and used by patients, health care providers, health plans, public health authorities,\nresearchers, and others to achieve access, exchange, or use of EHI by connecting to, interacting\nwith, or otherwise making use of Health IT Module(s) deployed within, for example, a health\ncare provider’s EHR system or a public health authority’s case reporting infrastructure. Our\ndefinition of API User in 45 CFR 170.404(c) illustrates this expectation: it includes both those\nwho create and those who use software applications that interact with API technology deployed\nby anyone functioning in the role of an API Information Source.\n\n\nFootnote 232:\nAs we clarified in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25749), health care providers are not subject to the\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.404(c) “unless they are serving the role of a\n‘Certified API Developer.’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have revised the wording of the finalized offer health IT definition in order to\nimprove certainty for individuals and entities who function in the role of an API Information\nSource (as defined in § 171.102 by cross-reference to § 170.404(c)) or function in an equivalent\nrole where any APIs involved are not certified but may be part of health IT product(s) that also\ninclude one or more Health IT Modules certified under the Program. Specifically, we have\nreplaced in the finalized offer health IT definition the phrase “for use” with the phrase “for\ndeployment by or for.” We believe this wording is more consistent with the distinction between\nthe act of connecting to, interacting with, or otherwise making use of a health IT item or service\n(for example, as an API User) and the act of allowing for such connections or interactions with\nthe health IT that an individual or entity (for example, a health care provider) relies on in\nconducting its own business operations.\n\nIn addition, we believe this updated wording encompasses the full array of models\nthrough which individuals and entities obtain health IT for implementation or other deployment\nin their operations. We include “or for” in this finalized wording to ensure it is clear that the\noffer health IT definition is met regardless of whether the customer to whom the health IT is\nprovided or supplied deploys the health IT by themselves or deploys the health IT by having the\nofferor or any third party(ies) do some or all such implementation and maintenance for them.\n\nProviding or supplying health IT that includes one or more Health IT Modules certified\nunder the Program meets the offer health IT definition finalized in § 171.102 regardless of whose\nemployees, contractors, or consultants actually install, configure, manage, or maintain such\nhealth IT or other health IT with which such health IT may be integrated, interfaced, or otherwise\ninteract. Likewise, holding out such health IT meets the offer health IT definition regardless of\nwhose employees, contractors, or consultants would be needed, expected, or likely to set it up,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanage, or maintain it in the event the holding out of the health IT resulted in the health IT being\nprovided or supplied to one or more other individual(s) or entity(ies). To reinforce this clarity,\nwe note that “deployment by or for” includes, without limitation, all of the following examples\nin which an individual’s or entity’s conduct would meet the offer health IT definition (and thus\nmeet the health IT developer of certified health IT definition) in § 171.102:\n• An individual or entity holds out, or provides or supplies, health IT for deployment by or\nfor potential customer(s) under a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, infrastructure-as-a-\nservice (IaaS) model, or any combination of these and other model(s) under which the\nofferor would implement and maintain on behalf of the customer any instance of the\nhealth IT. For purposes of this example, it would not matter whether a single-tenant\ninstance would be implemented for each customer or whether one or more customer(s)\nwould share multiple-tenant instance(s) of the health IT with the offeror or other\ncustomer(s).\n\n• An individual or entity holds out, or provides or supplies, health IT for the customer(s) to\nimplement themselves, using any combination of their own employees and contractors,\nany single- or multiple-tenant instance(s) of the health IT.\n\n• An individual or entity holds out or provides or supplies health IT that is implemented by\na third party to customers. For purposes of this example, it would not matter whether a\nsingle-tenant instance would be implemented for each customer or whether one or more\ncustomer(s) would share multiple-tenant instance(s) of the health IT with the third party\nor other customer(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested that we provide guidance or examples of how we\ndefine “beneficial” and “necessary” in the context of the exclusions from the offer health IT\ndefinition. A commenter requested guidance on our use of the verb “hold out” in the offer health\nIT definition. (Comments specific to particular exclusions are addressed in subsections IV.B.1.a\nthrough c, below.)\nResponse. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we discussed our purposes for proposing the\nexclusions, including “to encourage beneficial arrangements under which providers in need can\nreceive subsidies for the cost of obtaining, maintaining, or upgrading certified health IT.” Thus,\n“encourage[ing] beneficial arrangements” explains our intent and rationale for the exclusions (88\nFR 23858) and the term “beneficial” does not appear in the text of any of the exclusions. The\ntext of each exclusion defines and describes the arrangements that it excludes from the offer\nhealth IT definition.\n\nThe word “necessary” appeared in the proposed text describing excluded legal services\nfurnished by outside counsel (subparagraph (3)(i) of the § 171.102, offer health IT definition).\n\nWe did not propose to establish a purpose-specific meaning for the word “necessary” in this\ncontext. We intended it to have its widely understood and commonly used meaning of absolutely\nneeded, required, or of an inevitable nature.<sup>233</sup>\nUpon review of the comments, we have concluded\nthat we can improve the clarity of subparagraph (3)(i) by deleting the word “necessary.” The\nupdated language uses the phrase “as appropriate to legal discovery” to encompass the activity of\n\n\nFootnote 233:\nSee definitions of the adjective “necessary” by\n• Merriam-Webster Dictionary: “1: Absolutely needed: required; 2 a of an inevitable nature”\n\n(https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/necessary#:~:text=%3A%20absolutely%20needed%20%3A%20required,of%20an\n%20inevitable%20nature%20%3A%20inescapable, retrieved Nov 7, 2023);\n• Dictionary.com: “1. Essential, indispensable, or requisite. 2. Happening or existing by necessity.”\n\n(https://www.dictionary.com/browse/necessary, retrieved Nov 7, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacilitating the access or use of the client’s health IT when it is necessary as well as when it may\nbe only one of the practicable options through which the counsel’s clients can fulfill their legal\ndiscovery obligations.<sup>234</sup>\nWe use the term “hold out” in the text of the offer health IT definition as a transitive\nverb. As such, we believe “hold out” is generally understood in common usage to mean\npresenting an item or service as something realizable, attainable, or for acceptance.<sup>235</sup>\nWith his\ncommon usage in mind, we use “hold out” to ensure it is clear that an individual or entity’s\nactivities can meet the definition of offer health IT without anyone accepting the proffer of a sale\n(or resale) or of a license (or relicense), and without anyone otherwise obtaining or using any\nHealth IT Module(s) from that individual or entity. This operates as a safeguard against, for\nexample, the holding out for sale or license one or more ONC-certified Health IT Module(s) (or\nproducts containing such Module(s)) and ultimately only agreeing to provide non-certified health\nIT in an attempt to avoid meeting the offer health IT definition and to avoid being subject to\ninformation blocking regulations. For purposes of the information blocking regulations, if any\nindividual or entity is holding out health IT that includes one or more ONC-certified Health IT\nModules, that individual or entity will be considered to be offering health IT and thus would\nmeet the definition of health IT developer of certified health IT.\n\nWe further note that whether such a scenario might implicate other federal or state laws\ndoes not affect whether an individual or entity’s conduct meets the offer health IT definition.\n\n\nFootnote 234:\nThe offer health IT definition exclusion in subparagraph (3)(i) encompasses the activities by counsel it describes\nfor both EHI and other electronically stored information (ESI). For purposes of legal discovery, ESI includes\nwritings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, or other data or data compilations. (See,\ne.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a)(1)(A).)\n\n\nFootnote 235:\nSee e.g., https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hold%20out (Retrieved Jul 6, 2023): “to present\nsomething as realizable: proffer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested we ensure adequate protection of the provision of\nopen-source tools developed by open-source communities, irrespective of the terms on which\nthey are made available, whether the tool is necessary for use of the product or the provision of\ncare or whether the tool is integrated into a certified health IT product as part of the product. This\ncomment appears to convey uncertainty on the commenter’s part about whether a health care\nprovider’s (for example, a health system) integration of open-source modules with the certified\nhealth IT products it deploys (or has deployed by a third party on its behalf) to support its\nprovision of patient care and other operational activities meets the offer health IT definition. The\ncommenter also encouraged ONC to ensure that the provision of clinical decision support\nmodules by a health system through an open-source community is protected. This comment also\nappears to convey uncertainty on the commenter’s part as to if or when a participant in an open-\nsource community might be considered to offer health IT and, therefore, would meet the health\nIT developer of certified health IT definition in § 171.102.\n\n*Response.* We will discuss here how the finalized definition addresses these concerns, in\nthe order in which they are summarized above.\n\nFirst, specific to a health care provider deploying open-source health IT to support its\nprovision of patient care and other operational activities, we do not believe that the fact that the\nhealth care provider is deploying open-source health IT impacts the analysis. As we discussed\nabove, the offer health IT definition as finalized aligns with the API User and API Information\nSource role definitions previously established in § 171.102 and we believe the finalized\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefinition of offer health IT provides clarity that deploying<sup>236</sup>\nhealth IT that incorporates one or\nmore Health IT Modules certified under the Program is not an activity that meets the offer health\nIT definition, regardless of whether, or how much of, the health IT in question was developed by\nan open-source community or any other source or developer of health IT. For purposes of the\nfinalized offer health IT definition, we do not treat deploying a health IT product developed by\nan open-source community different from deploying a health IT product developed by a\ncommercial developer.\n\nAlso of note, the finalized offer health IT definition focuses on the holding out or\nprovision or supply of certified health IT products for deployment by or for other individual(s) or\nentity(ies). As cited in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule in connection to the proposed implementation\nand use activities exclusion (paragraph (2) of the offer health IT definition (88 FR 23860)), we\nnoted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that “some use of a self-developer's health IT may be\nmade accessible to individuals or entities other than the self-developer and its employees\nwithout that availability being interpreted as offering or supplying the health IT to other entities\nin a manner inconsistent with the concept of ‘self-developer’ ” (85 FR 25799, emphasis added).\n\nWe add emphasis here to “other than . . . its employees” and “to other entities” to highlight that\nthe offer health IT definition is not met by an individual or entity deploying health IT for use or\nimplementation in their own operations by their employees and contractors in the course of\nemployment or scope of the contract. We further note that the offer health IT definition is not\nmet when the action is deployment that makes the health IT available to individuals in certain\n\n\nFootnote 236:\nAs discussed above, the individual or entity “deploying” the health IT need not, for purposes of the offer health\nIT definition, do any or all of the implementation or maintenance of the health IT. The deploying individual or entity\ncould have any or all implementation and maintenance work for the health IT done for them by the offeror or one or\nmore third party(ies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnon-employee roles other than the deploying entity’s contractors. For these reasons, a health care\nprovider deploying health IT in the health care provider’s own operations would not meet the\noffer health IT definition—whether the health IT is open-source or not.\n\nTurning to the question of participation in an open-source development effort, we believe\nthe question of which participants in such communities fall within the definition of offer health\nIT is, necessarily, dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of any given case. For\nexample, relevant facts would include which participants in an open-source community have\nundertaken what role(s) and responsibility(ies) in relation to the certification status of the Health\nIT Module(s) involved.\n\nThe question of whether or when a participant in an open-source community engages in\nconduct that constitutes holding out, or providing or supplying, health IT that includes at least\none certified Health IT Module is similarly, and also necessarily, dependent on the specific facts\nand circumstances of the conduct. In any case, it is also important to recall that the offer health\nIT definition that we proposed, and have finalized, cannot be met unless the technology held out,\nor provided or supplied, for deployment by or for others includes one or more Health IT\nModule(s) certified under the Program. To the extent an open-source community produces only\nnon-certified health IT items or services, the development or offering of that non-certified health\nIT would not, of itself, result in the community or its participants being considered health IT\ndevelopers of certified health IT—regardless of whether the product is intended, designed, or fit\nfor use only in conjunction with certified health IT in general or specific certified health IT\nproduct(s). The community’s exclusively non-certified health IT items or services may be styled,\nbranded, named by the community, or commonly referenced in the marketplace as products,\napps, modules, or something else without affecting whether the community’s conduct falls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwithin the § 171.102 offer health IT definition. Neither the holding out nor the providing or\nsupplying of entirely and exclusively non-certified health IT can meet the offer health IT\ndefinition.\n\nWe recognize that once integrated with any deployment of a compatible certified product\n(such as ONC-certified EHR software), a non-certified health IT item such as a macro or\ntemplate might be difficult or impossible for the end user (such as a doctor using a health\nsystem’s EHR system to document a diagnosis) to distinguish from the certified health IT\nproduct. For individuals or entities who deploy certified health IT product(s), we recognize that\nsharing such items with others may raise questions similar to the one posed by the comment\nspecific to open-source health IT: does sharing with other individuals or entities a non-certified\nitem that, as experienced by end users, may seem like part of a certified health IT product meet\nthe offer health IT definition?<sup>237</sup>\nWe note that whether an actor’s conduct meets the offer health IT definition is not\ndetermined by the end user’s perception of what is or is not part of a single certified health IT\nproduct. Likewise, whether an individual’s or entity’s conduct meets the offer health IT\ndefinition is not determined by whether a particular health IT item or service that is not certified\nhealth IT can or cannot be used independently of certified health IT. The individual’s or entity’s\nconduct can meet the offer health IT definition only when the health IT that the individual or\nentity holds out, or provides or supplies, includes at least one Health IT Module certified under\nthe ONC Health IT Certification Program.\n\n\nFootnote 237:\nFor ease of reference, we may sometimes refer to suites, bundles, or other combinations of health IT items, services,\nor functions that include one or more Health IT Modules certified under the Program as “certified health IT products.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if a non-certified health IT item or service (for example, a macro or template) can\nonly be used in conjunction with a specific certified health IT product, the offer health IT\ndefinition is not met by holding out, or by providing or supplying, for deployment by or for\nothers only the non-certified health IT item or service. For example, a health care provider might\nchoose to make available to other members of a developer’s user group a macro that works only\nwith one of the developer’s Health IT Modules that is certified to § 171.315(b)(3). The\nhypothetical macro in this example is not a Health IT Module that is certified under the Program,\nand does not include any Health IT Module(s) certified under the Program when the health care\nprovider makes it available to other members of the user group. In this example scenario, the act\nof supplying the non-certified macro to other individual(s) or entity(ies) does not meet the\ndefinition of offer health IT.\n\nFor a similar example, an open-source community or its participants could make\navailable a “clinical decision support” (CDS) algorithm. In this example, the CDS algorithm is\nnot a Health IT Module that is certified under the Program. The act of holding out the algorithm\nfor deployment by or for others does not meet the offer health IT definition because the\nalgorithm is not certified health IT. Likewise, the act of providing or supplying the algorithm for\ndeployment by others does not meet the offer health IT definition. If, however, the algorithm was\nincluded as a part of a certified health IT product, and an individual or entity holds out, or\nprovides or supplies, the certified health IT with the algorithm in it for deployment by other\nindividual(s) or entity(ies), that conduct would meet the offer health IT definition.\n\n*Comments.* Two comments on the offer health IT definition referenced reporting\nrequirements in connection to the offer health IT definition. These comments did not identify\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecific reporting requirements they perceived entities would become subject to by engaging in\nconduct meeting the offer health IT definition.\n\n*Response.* As established by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule and updated by the\nprovisions finalized in this rule, the information blocking regulations (45 CFR part 171) do not\ninclude any requirements for any actor to proactively report to ONC.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that hosting, the provision of hosting services,\nor “extending their EHR” by health care providers for other health care providers should be\nexcluded from the definition of offer health IT. One such commenter stated a view that such\norganizations should not be considered to offer health IT and should not be subject to “more\nstringent” information blocking requirements.\n\n*Response.* In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we did not propose defining what conduct would\nmeet or not meet the offer health IT definition based on whether it was done by an individual or\nentity that otherwise meets the definition of any type of actor (as the term actor is defined in\n§ 171.102). These commenters’ rationale for excluding hosting, the provision of hosting services,\nor “extending their EHR” by health care providers for other health care providers centered on\npreventing health care providers engaged in such conduct from also meeting the definition of\nhealth IT developer of certified health IT. Therefore, we discuss in context of our proposal to\nupdate the health IT developer of certified health IT definition (see section IV.B.2 of this\npreamble, below) why we decline to establish at this time any regulatory provision with the\neffect these comments advocate.\n\nSummary of finalized policy—offer health IT: we have finalized the proposed offer health\ninformation technology or offer health IT definition with a revision to its wording in response to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomments received. The wording revision is from “for use by other individual(s) or entity(ies)”\nto “for deployment by or for other individual(s) or entity(ies).”\n\nTo increase clarity, we have further revised the definition by replacing the phrase “under\nany arrangement other than the following” with “under any arrangement except an arrangement\nconsistent with subparagraph (3)(iii), below.” As discussed above, activities described in other\nparagraphs and subparagraphs we do not interpret as holding out or as providing or supplying\nhealth IT for deployment by or for other individuals or entities. Thus, only subparagraph (3)(iii)\nfunctions to exclude from the offer health IT definition arrangements under which someone\nobtains from an individual or entity any certified Health IT Module(s).\n\nTo improve readability, we also revised the opening phrases of the definition. This\nrevision was from “… means to hold out for sale, resale, license, or relicense; or to sell, resell,\nlicense, relicense, or otherwise provide or supply health information technology (as that term is\ndefined in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5)) that includes one or more Health IT Modules certified under the\nONC Health IT Certification Program, …” to “… means: to hold out for sale, resale, license, or\nrelicense; or to sell, resell, license, relicense, or otherwise provide or supply health information\ntechnology (as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5) and where such health information\ntechnology includes one or more Health IT Modules certified under the ONC Health IT\nCertification Program) …” as finalized.\n\nFor readability, we added a second sentence to the offer health IT definition that also\nenhances clarity as to the function of the definition’s subparagraphs on the whole. That added\nsentence reads: “Activities and arrangements described in subparagraphs (1) through (3) are\nconsidered to be excluded from what it means to offer health IT.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finalized definition is shown in its entirety in the CFR amendatory instructions for\n§ 171.102 (see “Regulation Text” section of this rule, below).\n\n\n",

                  "title": "a. Exclusion of Certain Funding Subsidy Arrangements from Offer Health IT",
                  "text": "Definition\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we included a provision to address concerns regarding the\npotential of some health care providers and other donors to stop making available funding\nsubsidies that would go toward the cost of certified health IT in situations where the receiving\nhealth care provider is not able to afford the cost of the certified health IT. The proposal, in\nparagraph (1) of the offer health IT definition in § 171.102, explicitly excluded certain\narrangements that focused on providing funding subsidies for providers to obtain, maintain,\nand/or upgrade certified health IT. We explained how this exclusion would operate in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23859). We refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for the full\ndiscussion of the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)).\n\n*Comments.* Of the comment submissions addressing this proposed exclusion, six\nsupported exclusion of funding subsidy arrangements from the offer health IT definition. One\ncomment submission did not express general opposition to the exclusion but expressed\nopposition to the definition of offer health IT excluding subsidies tied to a specific product, or\nexcluding subsidies that would promote or prioritize imaging referrals of patients to the\nsubsidizing entity or its partners. This comment, from two large clinical societies, recommended\nthat if we finalize this exclusion, we state in preamble that promotion or prioritization of the\nsubsidizing entity’s services over those of unaffiliated, competing providers would not be\nexempted from the offer health IT definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback. We have finalized the exclusion of\nfunding subsidy arrangements (paragraph (1) of the offer health IT in § 171.102) as proposed (88\nFR 23915). The donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion as proposed and as\nfinalized is conditional, as indicated by this language in paragraph (1) of the offer health IT\ndefinition: “provided such individual or entity offers and makes such subsidy without\ncondition(s) limiting the interoperability or use of the technology to access, exchange, or use\nelectronic health information for any lawful purpose.” Thus, the donation and subsidized supply\narrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)) does not apply if the subsidy is conditioned on limiting\nthe interoperability or use of the technology to access, exchange, or use EHI for any lawful\npurpose. Any agreement terms, statements (written or oral), patterns of conduct, or singular\nactions whereby the source of donation or funding subsidy conditions the donation on the\nrecipient’s limiting its use of health IT or its access, use, or exchange of EHI in ways specified or\nsignaled by the funding source would be considered a condition limiting interoperability or use\nof the technology. Therefore, we do not believe that the purpose of this exclusion would be better\nserved by limiting it at this time to arrangements under which recipients can choose to apply a\nfunding subsidy to a minimum array of products or to any product on the market. However, we\nplan to remain alert for signals that funding subsidy sources may be misusing this exclusion.<sup>238</sup>\n\n\nFootnote 238:\nPatterns described to us in claims or suggestions of possible information blocking submitted through the Report\nInformation Blocking Portal represent just one example of the ways such signals may come to our attention. (The\nReport Information Blocking Portal’s URL is: https://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/6).\n\nInformation on the claims process that is publicly available on Health IT.gov\n(https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-blocking) includes a fact sheet on the Report Information Blocking\nportal process (https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page2/2021-11/Information-Blocking-Portal-Process.pdf)\nand a resource titled “Information Blocking Claims: By the Numbers”\n\n(https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/information-blocking-claims-numbers). As of October 2023, “Information\nBlocking Claims: By the Numbers” provides the total number of portal submissions received since April 5, 2021,\nthe number of these submissions that represent claims of possible information blocking, and the number of these\nclaims by type of potential actor and type of claimant. (URLs confirmed Oct 18, 2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that we may consider amending this definition in future rulemaking in response to\nchanging market conditions.\n\nWe appreciate commenters’ concerns about donation or subsidy arrangements tied to\nspecific technology where the donation or arrangement is for the purpose of promoting referrals\nto the source of the funding or its affiliates. We believe the proviso in the donation and\nsubsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)), as proposed, is sufficient to ensure it\ndoes not apply to arrangements conditioned by the source(s), donor(s), or giver(s) on limiting\ninteroperability or use of the technology. As stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we do not\nbelieve it is necessary to assess, for purposes of determining whether a funding subsidy should\nbe considered an offer of certified health IT, whether the source(s) of the subsidy conditions the\nsubsidy on the recipient referring patients to or away from the source. As we noted, there may be\nother laws implicated by solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for referral steering\nand similar conduct (88 FR 23859). For example, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C.\n\n1320a–7b(b), section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) could be implicated where\nremuneration is directly or indirectly offered, paid, solicited, or received for the referral of or\narrangement of a referral of any item, service, or good for which payment may be made in whole\nor part under a “Federal health care program” (as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b(f)). Nothing in\nthis final rule should be construed as creating an exception to any fraud and abuse laws.\n\nIn light of the commenters’ concern, we believe it may be useful to clarify how the\ndonation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion from the offer health IT definition\noperates for purposes of 45 CFR part 171 in the context of a donor or funding source that is\nusing a subsidy to steer referrals or to distort the market for healthcare items or services through\na condition(s) that limit the use of donation-supported or subsidized technology or the lawful\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI. As noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (at 88 FR 23859), we\ninterpret “conditions limiting the interoperability or use of the technology to access, exchange, or\nuse electronic health information” broadly. Specifically, we noted we would consider conditions\nto include not only the explicit terms of any written agreement but also oral statements and\npatterns of conduct on the part of the subsidy's source(s) toward, in the presence of, or made\nknown by the source(s) to the subsidy's recipient. We further noted that we would consider a\ncondition(s) to include a subsidy source limiting the use of the subsidy to particular technology\nthat includes, or otherwise arranges for subsidy-supported technology to include, features,\nfunctions, coding, or other means that would limit recipients’ options to lawfully use that\ntechnology to access, exchange, or use EHI. A recipient health care provider’s access, exchange,\nand use of EHI for such purposes is not limited to but necessarily includes access, exchange, and\nuse by care team members in the course of making diagnosis and treatment decisions within their\nscopes of practice and making referrals in accord with their professional judgement and\nunderstanding of their patient’s preferences.\n\nThe limitation on the application of the offer health IT definition’s donation and\nsubsidized supply arrangements exclusion in paragraph (1) of the definition is, as noted in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule, a safeguard against inappropriate use of the exclusion by entities seeking\nto distort the health IT market. This would include efforts to limit recipients' options to use\nadditional technology or to otherwise impede innovations and advancements in health\ninformation access, exchange, and use (88 FR 23859). The donation and subsidized supply\narrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)) applies only where the individual or entity donates,\ngives, or otherwise makes available funding without condition(s) limiting the interoperability or\nuse of the technology to access, exchange, or use EHI for any lawful purpose. We did not\n\n\n\n\n\n\npropose that the exclusion could apply to any arrangement conditioned in any way on limiting\nthe interoperability or use of the subsidy-supported technology or the recipient’s use of the\ntechnology to access, exchange, or use EHI for any lawful purpose. We have finalized the\nexclusion as proposed.\n\nWe further clarify in view of comments received that the limitation on application of the\ndonation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion in paragraph (1) of the definition does\nnot consider what underlying intent or motive the funding source may have for any condition\nthat limit the interoperability or use of the technology to access, exchange, or use electronic\nhealth information for any lawful purpose. Any condition that has such effect will mean the\narrangement falls outside of the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion\n(paragraph (1) of the offer health IT definition). Then, whether such non-excluded funding\nsubsidy or donation arrangements would constitute the funding source offering health IT would\nhave to be evaluated to determine whether the conduct constitutes holding out for sale, resale,\nlicense, relicense, or otherwise providing or supplying health information technology for\ndeployment by other individual(s) or entity(ies).\n\nTo note, any third-party health IT developer of certified health IT or HIN/HIE that may\nbe engaged in funding subsidy arrangements related to providing, configuring, or otherwise\nsupporting health IT will want to bear in mind that their engagement in any practice they know\nor should know is likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI could constitute\ninformation blocking on the part of the actor (unless an applicable law requires or an exception\nset forth in 45 CFR part 171 is satisfied by such practice). This includes scenarios where the\npractice occurred at the direction of or on behalf of a funding subsidy source. This would be true\nfor the health IT developer of certified health IT or an HIN/HIE regardless of whether the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunding subsidy source or recipient is also an actor, and regardless of whether the funding\nsubsidy source or recipient also engaged in conduct meeting the information blocking definition.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended we adopt a policy under which a health\ncare provider would not be considered to offer health IT, or be considered only a health care\nprovider and excluded from the “health IT developer of certified health IT” definition, even if\nthey “extend their EHRs” or otherwise donate or provide health IT on terms more affordable to a\nrecipient than those available from other vendors of health IT items or services. Several\ncommenters suggested such provision of health IT be excluded from the definition of offer health\nIT. A commenter that is a health system advocated for an explicit exclusion in situations where a\nhealth care provider hosts instances of a particular developer’s EHR for other health care\nproviders. A developer of certified health IT advocated to exclude from the definition of offer\nhealth IT any health IT resale or relicensing arrangements on non-discriminatory bases between\nhealth care providers or HIPAA covered entities. The developer’s comment acknowledged the\npotential for organizations hosting or otherwise reselling health IT to make configurations or\nother implementation decisions potentially implicating the information blocking definition but\nasserted they had not observed this to have occurred among the providers reselling the\ndeveloper’s health IT.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ sharing their experiences and perspectives. We\ndid not propose that the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion from the offer\nhealth IT definition would apply to a health care provider selling, licensing, or otherwise\nproviding or supplying certified health IT (whether such health IT is self-developed by the\nprovider offering it or obtained from a third-party developer) to other health care providers on a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubsidized, discounted, or other basis. We decline to do so for reasons we discuss in this\nresponse and in Section IV.B.2 of this preamble below.\n\nWe cannot be certain whether commenters’ reference to providers who “extend their\nEHRs” or similar wordings are meant to describe the donor health care provider entity selling,\nreselling, licensing, relicensing, or otherwise providing or supplying the health IT itself for\ndeployment by the recipient providers. Therefore, to ensure clarity, we note that we perceive a\nclear distinction between two kinds of conduct. One distinct kind of conduct is donating, giving,\nor otherwise making available to a recipient funding to cover costs of an item or service (such as\nhealth IT that includes one or more Health IT Modules certified under the Program). A distinctly\nseparate kind of conduct is the sale, resale, licensing, relicensing, or otherwise providing or\nsupplying of the item or service itself to the recipient.\n\nWe proposed thar the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph\n(1)) to encompass arrangements where “an individual or entity donates, gives, or otherwise\nmakes available funding to subsidize or fully cover the costs of a health care provider's\nacquisition, augmentation, or upkeep of health IT” (88 FR 23915). We stated in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule that the proposed donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion “would\nremove from the definition of offer health information technology or offer health IT the provision\nof subsidies, in the form of funding or cost coverage subsidy arrangements for certified health\nIT” (88 FR 23859). We have finalized the donation and subsidized supply arrangements\nexclusion (paragraph (1)) of the offer health IT definition (§ 171.102) as proposed. Thus, the\nfinalized first exclusion of the definition encompasses furnishing monetary resources (as\ndescribed at 88 FR 23859, “subsidies, in the form of funding or cost coverage subsidy\narrangements”) for an item or service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reiterate that the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion as proposed\nand as finalized in paragraph (1) of the offer health IT definition does not encompass any\narrangement where an individual or entity does any of the following to or with any health IT that\nincludes one or more certified Health IT Module(s):\n• holds out the health IT for sale, resale, license, or relicense for deployment by or for other\nindividual(s) or entity(ies);\n• sells, resells, licenses, relicenses the health IT for deployment by or for other\nindividual(s) or entity(ies); or\n• otherwise provides or supplies the health IT for deployment by or for other individual(s)\nor entity(ies).\n\nTo prevent any potential confusion or misunderstanding about the significance of our\nreference to “subsidized supply” arrangements in the text of the exclusion in (paragraph (1) of\nthe offer health IT definition, we note that this is included to explicitly recognize a type of\narrangement whereby a donor or other subsidy source subsidizes or fully covers costs by\npayment of such costs to the individual or entity that develops or offers the health IT item(s) or\nservice(s) subsidized.\n\nFor an example of a scenario in which the donation and subsidized supply arrangements\nexclusion (paragraph 1) applies: a health system arranges with a health IT developer that the\nhealth system will pay eighty-five percent of the cost of any contract for use of a (developer\nhosted) EHR product suite by any health care provider that gives the developer a particular code\nthat was supplied to the health care provider by the health system. Note that in this example the\nEHR product suite includes one or more Health IT Modules certified under the Program (because\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe offer health IT definition is not met if health IT that is held out or that is provided or supplied\ndoes not include any such Health IT Module(s).) The health system gives the code to\nindependent safety net providers in its service area as a means of making funding available to the\nsafety net providers to cover part of the safety net providers’ cost to obtain and maintain use of\nan EHR product suite. A critical part of an analysis of the application of the exclusion in this\nexample is whether money covering (part of) the contract costs for health IT is being supplied or\nwhether the health IT itself is being supplied by the health system. Here the health system is only\nmaking a funding subsidy available. The health IT developer is supplying the health IT (EHR\nproduct suite).\n\nIn a different example, where a health system instead offers to host and support ONC-\ncertified health IT for a safety net provider, the health system would be engaged in conduct to\nwhich the donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)) would not\napply. Regardless of whether the entity doing the holding out or furnishing of health IT (or\nanyone else) would be subsidizing (in whole or in part) the costs of the health IT, the donation\nand subsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph (1)) does not apply where an\nindividual or entity holds out or, under any arrangement, provides or supplies for deployment by\nor for other individual(s) or entity(ies) any health IT product(s) that include one or more Health\nIT Modules certified under the Program.\n\nWe recognize that some health care providers, or other individuals or entities, may\nchoose to engage, on a subsidized basis for the recipient or as a donation to the recipient, in\nconduct that is not encompassed by the exclusion in paragraph (1) but to which another\nexclusion to the offer health IT definition applies. In the interest of providing such individuals\nand entities certainty, we note that if any exclusion to the offer health IT definition applies to any\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparticular conduct, it does not matter whether one or more other exclusion(s) do or do not also\napply. If at least one exclusion applies to any particular conduct, that conduct is excluded from\nthe offer health IT definition.\n\nFinally, we note again that donation and subsidized supply arrangements can implicate\nother laws, including the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and nothing in this final rule should be\nconstrued as creating an exception to any fraud and abuse laws.\n\nWe further discuss below, in the context of the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition (section IV.B.2), our current position regarding health care providers who choose to\nengage in conduct that meets the offer health IT definition. However, it is important for\nproviders and other individual(s) or entity(ies) interested in engaging in any conduct that meets\nthe offer health IT definition to note that engaging in such conduct makes the individual or entity\none that offers health IT. This means such an individual or entity will meet the health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT definition regardless of whether the individual or entity also\nhappens to engage in any other conduct that is encompassed by an exclusion from the definition\nor that otherwise does not meet the offer health IT definition.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested we confirm that subsidy arrangements where the\nfunding source is not otherwise a § 171.102 actor are encompassed by the exclusion. The\ncomment cited, as an example, subsidies from health plans to providers. Another comment\nrecommended that we clarify the offer health IT definition excludes subsidy arrangements\nbetween healthcare entities, such as a health plan and community provider. Other comments\nsuggested that we should reiterate that engaging in activities described in exclusion (1) is not a\nway for an individual or entity that is otherwise a § 171.102 actor to opt out of being subject to\ninformation blocking regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* The finalized donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion\n(paragraph (1)) applies to the arrangements it describes. It does not specify characteristics that\nthe source of the subsidy must have (or not have) for the arrangement to be excluded from the\noffer health IT definition. If any person engages in conduct described in paragraph (1), that\nmeans the excluded conduct does not fall within the definition of offer health IT. Thus, engaging\nin conduct described in paragraph (1) of the offer health IT definition will not turn an individual\nor entity who does not otherwise meet the § 171.102 actor definition into an “actor” for purposes\nof the information blocking regulations.\n\nIt is important to remember, however, that engaging in conduct described in the donation\nand subsidized supply arrangements exclusion (paragraph 1) simply has no effect on whether a\nperson is not or is considered an actor as defined in § 171.102 for purposes of 45 CFR part 171.\n\nEven if an individual or entity that is otherwise an actor engages in conduct described in\nsubparagraph (1) of the offer health IT definition, the person is still an actor. For example, if any\nentity meets the § 171.102 definition of health care provider then that entity is a health care\nprovider regardless of whether it also happens to engage in conduct described in the donation\nand subsidized supply arrangements exclusion from the offer health IT definition. Also, any\nentity meeting the § 171.102 definition of health IT developer of certified health IT through any\nof its activities is a health IT developer of certified health IT regardless of whether it also\nhappens to engage in conduct described in the donation and subsidized supply arrangements\nexclusion (paragraph 1).\n\nA health care provider or health IT developer of certified health IT would remain subject\nto the information blocking regulations for any of their conduct that meets the definition of\ninformation blocking in § 171.103, including when that conduct occurs in the course of activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat fit the description of any exclusion from the offer health IT definition. Similarly, when and\nto the extent a health plan, health plan issuer, or any other entity engages in conduct meeting the\nfunctional definition of health information network or health information exchange (HIN/HIE),\nthen that entity is a HIN/HIE regardless of whether the entity also happens to engage, at the same\ntime, in conduct described in any exclusion from the offer health IT definition.<sup>239</sup>\nComments. A commenter who referenced experience with donation of hospital equipment\nnoted it is important for recipients of donated technology to have access to design documents,\ndata schema, and other resources needed to facilitate the use of donated health IT systems\nthrough maintenance, process improvement, and interoperability concerns. This commenter\nencouraged ONC to provide a broad dissemination of publicly available user manuals, access to\nspare parts, and consumable resources to facilitate the use of donated equipment. A commenter\nsuggested we consider adjusting conditions of the donation and subsidized supply arrangements\nexclusion to address the impact of discontinued subsidies on the recipient’s ability to maintain\nthe health IT over time.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns raised by these comments. Specific to Health IT\nModules certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program, our Program regulations in\n45 CFR part 170 provide for public availability of certain information and documentation about\nthe technology. (See 45 CFR 170.523 disclosures applicable to certified Health IT Modules, 45\nCFR 170.404(a)(2) transparency conditions for Certified API Technology.) To the extent\ndocumentation needed to effectively use health IT products that include non-certified items and\nservices in complement to one or more Health IT Module(s) certified under the Program, such\n\n\nFootnote 239:\nThe health information network or health information exchange definition is a functional definition. See 45 CFR\n171.102, see also 85 FR 25800 through 85 FR 25803.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocumentation would fall outside the scope of the Program’s disclosures and transparency\nrequirements. However, we believe the information blocking regulations discourage an actor\nfrom inappropriately withholding access to such documentation from recipients of their health\nIT. If an actor’s practice of denying the recipients of health IT such information is likely to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI, that practice could implicate the information\nblocking definition. It is not clear what consumable supplies or spare parts relevant to health IT\nwere referenced by the comment advocating ONC provide broad access to them. It is also not\nclear what is meant by the commenter advocating ONC “provide access” to spare parts and\nconsumables. We note that the information blocking regulations maintain policies supportive of\nthe access, exchange, and use of EHI and include policies under which the individuals and\nentities who actually supply health IT (donated or otherwise) for deployment by or for other\nindividuals or entities generally continue to be subject to enforcement under the information\nblocking regulations as health IT developers of certified health IT.\n\nConcerns specific to a supplier of technology withholding access to documentation and\nresources needed to use systems represents one example of conduct likely to interfere with a\nrecipient’s access, exchange, or use of EHI. This concern illustrates just one of many possible\npractices any individual or entity that engages in conduct meeting the finalized offer health IT\ndefinition would have opportunity to engage in that would be likely to interfere with customers’\nand others’ ability to access, exchange, or use EHI in or through the health IT “offered.” Such\nopportunities to interfere with customers’ access, exchange, or use of EHI are among the reasons\nwe believe it would be inappropriate to exclude from the offer health IT definition the sale,\nresale, licensing, or relicensing of any Health IT Module based on such offering being subsidized\nby the offeror or a third party. Therefore, such conduct will generally continue to fall within the\n\n\n\n\n\n\noffer health IT definition. By engaging in any conduct falling within the offer health IT\ndefinition, the individual or entity engaged in the conduct meets the health IT developer of\ncertified health IT definition and is subject to information blocking regulations accordingly.\n\nWe further note that this comment highlights the importance of prospective recipients of\ntechnology donations carefully considering the full terms of both the donation or subsidy\narrangement and any contracts or other agreements with a developer, seller, reseller, licenser, or\nrelicenser of the technology involved. For example, and for practical reasons entirely\nindependent of the information blocking regulations, it is important for a recipient to know what\nitems and services are included in the subsidy or donation and the level, extent, and duration of\nsupport for those items or services that the donation commits the funding source to cover. The\ninformation blocking regulations do not eliminate the need for anyone contemplating adopting\nhealth IT items or services pursuant to a donation or subsidy arrangement to consider and plan\nfor their ability to maintain the health IT in good working order, or successfully transition away\nfrom it, at the end of a one-time donation or subsidy arrangement or in the event an arrangement\nproviding an ongoing subsidy were to be discontinued (or not renewed). This would be true for\nadoption of initial, additional, upgraded, or replacement health IT items or services.\n\nWe also note that whether, as potential recipients of subsidized health IT or as a customer\npaying the full cost or market price themselves, all prospective recipients of any health IT will\nlikely find it important to know and understand the terms of all agreements with the developer or\nofferor of health IT items or services they obtain. For example, a customer contemplating\nadoption of any health IT item or service would want to consider the potential that they may\nwant to replace that particular product with another product in the future. Such a customer would\nwant to look closely at how any data the product stores will be returned to the customer at the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nend of the agreement with the developer or other offeror of the health IT, and what support may\nbe available, and on what terms, to help the customer (or a health IT developer or support\ncontractor of the customer) import the data into the next product the customer will use to access,\nexchange, or use that data.\n\nRecipients of donated health IT, like all customers of health IT, will also find it important\nto know whether technology they are considering for adoption includes any Health IT Module(s),\nor if the developer or offeror that would provide the technology has any Health IT Module(s),\ncertified under the Program. An individual or entity that develops or offers health IT, but who\ndoes not develop or offer any certified Health IT, might not be subject to information blocking\nregulations unless the individual or entity is a health care provider or a HIN/HIE as defined in\n§ 171.102.<sup>240</sup>\nSummary of finalized policy – donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion\n(paragraph 1): After consideration of the comments received that are relevant to, and within the\nscope of, this proposal, we finalized the policy, as proposed. Provision of funding to a recipient\nwho will use it to cover some or all of the recipient’s health IT acquisition, augmentation, or\nupkeep cost is explicitly excluded from the offer health IT definition. Likewise, arrangements\nwhereby a funding source (whether or not referenced or styled as a “donor”) pays, remits, or\notherwise transfers to a third-party funds covering the cost (in whole or part) of a health care\nprovider’s acquisition, augmentation, or upkeep of health IT are explicitly excluded from the\noffer health IT definition to the extent they are consistent with paragraph (1). However, the text\n\n\nFootnote 240:\nThe § 171.102 health care provider and HIN/HIE definitions do not have a definitional component related to\ncertified health IT. An individual or entity can meet either or both of these definitions without having, using, or\noffering any certified health IT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof paragraph (1) explicitly and intentionally limits application of the donation and subsidized\nsupply arrangements exclusion to those arrangements whereby the source of the subsidy makes\navailable funding to cover costs of acquisition, augmentation, or upkeep of health IT. The\nfinalized paragraph (1), donation and subsidized supply arrangements exclusion from the offer\nhealth IT definition, does not apply to sale, licensing, resale, relicensing, or provision or supply\nof the health IT itself — regardless of whether such provision or supply is on subsidized or other\nterms.\n\nWe reiterate that no individual or entity that otherwise meets the definition of any type of\nactor in § 171.102 can opt out of being subject to information blocking regulations by engaging\nin any activity excluded from the offer health IT definition.\n\n\n",

The exclusion is designed to encourage the donation of health IT without discouraging interoperability. However, if the subsidy is tied to conditions that limit interoperability or EHI use, the exclusion does not apply. The ONC will monitor for misuse of this exclusion and may amend the definition in the future if necessary.

                  "title": "b. Implementation and Use Activities That Are Not an Offering of Health IT",
                  "text": "In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we noted that there are certain actions taken by health\ncare providers who self-develop health IT for their own use that we do not interpret as them\noffering or supplying certified health IT to others (85 FR 25799). Specifically, we noted that\n“some use of a self-developer’s health IT may be made accessible to individuals or entities other\nthan the self-developer and its employees without that availability being interpreted as offering\nor supplying the health IT to other entities in a manner inconsistent with the concept of ‘self-\ndeveloper,’ and we provided examples of activities that we do not consider offers (85 FR 25799).\n\nSome of the examples we noted (85 FR 25799) were discussed in the context of practices\namongst hospitals that purchase commercially marketed health IT as well as self-developer\nhospitals.\n\nWhile the examples focus on self-developers, these examples would not be considered\n“offering” health IT regardless of who developed the certified health IT. We also believe there\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare examples of activities we did not discuss that should not be considered offers of health IT.\n\nWe, therefore, proposed in paragraph (2) of the offer health IT definition (see 88 FR 23860 and\n88 FR 23915) to explicitly exclude from the definition of offer health IT certain implementation\nand use activities of a health care provider or other entity (such as a HIN/HIE, health plan, or\npublic health authority). We refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23860) discussions\nof the activities explicitly listed within the implementation and use activities exclusion from\n(paragraph (2) of) the definition of offer health IT we have now finalized within § 171.102.\n\nWe sought comment on this proposal, including whether we should consider revising or\nrefining any of the descriptions or wordings of the functionalities, features, actions, or activities\nlisted in the draft regulation text or whether we should consider explicitly excluding additional\nactivities, actions, or health IT functionalities from what it means to offer health IT.\n\n*Comments.* Comments referencing this exclusion supported the provision. Several\ncommenters recommended specific refinements to the wording or clarifications to the intended\nscope of the exclusion. Comments were received that recommended the implementation and use\nactivities exclusion encompass each of the following as implementation and use activities:\n• a health care provider organization or other entity uses pre-production staging or test\nenvironments for certified health IT;\n• use of health IT for purposes of clinical education and improvement activities, including\nin simulation environments where no care is furnished to actual patients;\n• a health care provider providing a public health authority’s employees or contractors with\naccess to its health IT systems;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• providing access to registries and similar data services that are provided by public health\nauthorities, regardless of the route used to request/access/receive data (e.g., through direct\nlogon to a public health information system, via an app or third-party tool, or via\nHIN/HIE).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments received on the proposed implementation and use\nexclusion. In response to comments received, we have revised the wording of the finalized\nregulation text in the offer health IT definition (as discussed in section IV.B.1 of this rule, above)\nand have also revised the wording of subparagraphs within paragraph (2) (discussed in the\nsummary of finalized policy – implementation and use exclusion (paragraph (2)) at the end of\nthis section, IV.B.1.b, of this rule).\n\nAs discussed in section IV.B.1 of this final rule, we reviewed the wording of the offer\nhealth IT definition in light of a HITAC comment about providing access to registries and\nsimilar data services provided by public health authorities, regardless of the route used to\nrequest/access/receive data. We believe the change in the offer health IT definition’s wording\nfrom “for use by” to “for deployment by or for” better aligns the wording of this definition with\nthe definitions of “API User” and “API Information Source” previously established in § 171.102\nby cross-reference to § 170.404(c) (as discussed in section IV.B.1 of this rule, above). We also\nbelieve this wording change removed a need to catalog within paragraph (2) all of the various\nmanners in which access, exchange, or use of EHI with public health entities and with others\nmight be accomplished without the individual or entity in the API Information Source role (or\nequivalent role for non-certified API technology or other manners of access, exchange, or use)\nmeeting the offer health IT definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe excluded activity descriptions in subparagraphs (2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) are intended to\naccommodate current heterogeneity in how individuals and entities who deploy health IT (such\nas health care providers) make EHI available for access, exchange, or use by their information\nsharing partners. With the minor changes in wording that we mention above, we believe it is\nclear that subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of paragraph (2) in conjunction with the revision to the\noffer health IT definition’s wording accomplish this intent. Although subparagraph (2)(ii)\ndiscusses APIs and (2)(iii) discusses online portals, we believe that they, when taken together\nwith subparagraph (2)(iv), provide for extensive heterogeneity in the manners of information\nsharing available now or in the future to those who access, exchange, or use EHI. Moreover, we\nbelieve the wording change that we discuss above from “for use by” to “for deployment by or\nfor” also addresses commenters’ concerns about whether the offer health IT definition does or\ndoes not include interactions with or use of pre-production or other non-production instance(s) of\nAPI technology.\n\nWe also reiterate that, as we stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23860), we do not\nbelieve it is necessary to define a production instance because we observe health IT developers,\nresellers, and customers generally using and understanding a production instance as a particular\nimplementation of a given health IT product that has “gone live” in a production environment\n(without needing to specify, for this purpose, whether such instance is single- or multi-tenant).\n\nProduction environments, in turn, we observe are generally understood as being the setting\nwhere health IT is implemented, run, and relied on by end users in day-to-day conduct of their\nprofession (such as medicine, nursing, or pharmacy) or other business (such as a payer\nprocessing healthcare reimbursement claims or a patient managing their health and care).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of finalized policy – implementation and use activities exclusion (paragraph 2):\nAfter consideration of comments, we have finalized the proposed implementation and use\nactivities exclusion (paragraph (2)) with revisions. As described in more detail below, we have\nrefined how we describe several types of activities within the exclusion.\n\nWe have struck from subparagraph (2)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) the parenthetical “as defined\nin this section” following the terms “electronic health information” and “health information\nnetwork or health information exchange.” The § 171.102 definitions of these terms apply\nthroughout 45 CFR part 171 unless otherwise specified in a particular subpart or section. Thus,\nthe presence or absence of this parenthetical has no effect on the meaning of the subparagraphs\nnoted above and has been removed from the final text.\n\nThe wording of the activity description in subparagraph (2)(i) has been revised to remove\nreference to employees or contractors using the individual’s or entity’s health IT to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in the course of their employment. Instead, the exclusion lists a variety of\ntypes of activities that an individual’s or entity’s employees or contractors might do within the\nscope of their employment or contract duties specific to, or otherwise requiring use of, access to\nthe health IT. The finalized wording of subparagraph (2)(i) explicitly includes use, operation,\nconfiguration, testing, maintenance, update, and upgrade activities for an individual’s or entity’s\nhealth IT system(s) or specific application(s) within such systems. It also includes explicit\nreference to the individual’s or entity’s employees or contractors giving or receiving training on\nthe health IT.\n\nWe believe this explicit list of purposes for which employees or contractors might need to\nuse an individual’s or entity’s deployed health IT provides the clarity some commenters sought\nregarding a health care provider maintaining non-production instances of health IT for various\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurposes other than supporting care delivery, documentation, or billing of healthcare. We believe\nthis clarity is achieved by the rewording of subparagraph (2)(i) in complement to the change\nfrom “for use by” to “for deployment by or for” others in the offer health IT definition.\n\nWe have finalized subparagraph (2)(ii) with one revision to its wording: we have\nremoved the parenthetical statement “(whether certified or not)” to improve readability. The\ndeletion of “(whether certified or not)” has no effect on the substance of subparagraph (2)(ii)\nbecause the description references API technology in general. As used in subparagraph (ii) of the\nimplementation and use activities exclusion, “application programming interface (API)\ntechnology” encompasses “Certified API Technology” as defined in 45 CFR 170.404(c) as well\nas any other API technology.\n\nAs proposed, subparagraph (2)(ii) referenced production instances and did not reference\npre-production instances. We have retained reference to “production instances” of API\ntechnology in the excluded activity description in the finalized definition as the finalized offer\nhealth IT definition’s wording change from “for use by” to “for deployment by or for” makes it\nunnecessary to explicitly encompass pre-production instances within subparagraph (2)(ii) of\nexclusion (2). Specifically, the revised wording of the offer health IT definition makes it clear\nthat deploying any instance(s) of API technology with which independent, outside persons\nparticipating in testing activities might interact (in the course of testing or QI activities, or in the\nrole of API User as defined in § 171.404(c) or an analogous role for health IT other than\n“Certified API Technology” as defined in § 171.404(c)) does not, in and of itself, meet the offer\nhealth IT definition. By contrast, the holding out, or the providing or supplying, for deployment\nby or for other individuals or entities under any arrangement not described in exclusion (3)(iii) of\nhealth IT that includes one or more Health IT Module(s) would meet the offer health IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefinition, regardless of whether such other individual(s) or entity(ies) were to deploy (or have\ndeployed on their behalf) production instance(s), pre-production instance(s), or any combination\nof production and pre-production instances of the offered health IT.\n\nWe have removed from the finalized text of subparagraph (2)(iii) a comma that\nimmediately followed the word “clinicians.” This comma was a typographical error that has been\ncorrected so that the finalized text describes making portals available to any or all of the\nfollowing: patients, clinicians or other health care providers, or public health entities. We use\n“public health entities” here to encompass public health authorities, their employees, and their\ncontractor(s) acting in the scope of the contract to the public health authority.\n\nSpecific to implementation and use activities of entities that need to share information\nwith public health authorities, the revised wording of the offer health IT definition (from “for use\nby” to “for deployment by or for,” as discussed in section IV.B.1 of this preamble) renders the\npresence or absence of specific reference in subparagraph (2)(iii) or (iv) to public health\nauthorities’ contractors largely moot, because the activities subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) describe\n(as proposed and finalized) do not involve or include supplying health IT for deployment.\n\nHowever, we proposed the implementation and use activities exclusion (paragraph (2)) for the\npurpose of giving health care providers (and others) who use certified health IT certainty that\nimplementing certain health IT features and functionalities, as well as engaging in certain\npractices that are beneficial in an EHR-enabled healthcare environment, will not be considered\n“offering” certified health IT (regardless of who developed that health IT) (88 FR 23858).\n\nTherefore, we have finalized subparagraph (2)(iv) with addition of explicit reference to public\nhealth authorities’ contractors to better serve subparagraph (2)(iv)’s purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the activity described in subparagraph (2)(iv) was not proposed to, and as\nfinalized does not, encompass supplying health IT for deployment by or for public health\nauthorities or any other individual(s) or entity(ies). Holding out, providing, or supplying health\nIT that includes one or more certified Health IT Module(s) for deployment by or for a public\nhealth authority will meet the offer health IT definition. (see also the discussion of deployment\nversus use of health IT in section IV.B.1 of this preamble.)\nWe have modified the wording of subparagraph (v) of exclusion (2) in response to\ncomments seeking explicit clarity regarding the implications of a healthcare facility potentially\nallowing independent healthcare professionals who furnish services in a healthcare facility to use\nthe facility’s health IT for clinical education and improvement activities or to receive training in\nthe use of the healthcare facility’s health IT systems. Specifically, following “furnishing,\ndocumenting, and accurately billing for that care,” we have added: “participating in clinical\neducation or improvement activities conducted by or in the healthcare facility; or receiving\ntraining in use of the healthcare facility’s health IT system(s).” With the clarification of the\nwording of the offer health IT definition (as discussed above in section IV.B.1 of this final rule)\nfrom “for use by” to “for deployment by or for” other individuals, we believe the distinction is\nclear between supplying independent healthcare professionals with health IT to deploy in their\noutside practice(s) or other endeavors and merely enabling independent healthcare professionals\nto use a healthcare facility’s health IT systems in the course of the professional’s engagement in\npatient care and other activities conducted by or in the healthcare facility.\n\nAs is the case for subparagraph (2)(iv), we have nevertheless decided to finalize\nsubparagraph (2)(v) to serve the purpose for which we proposed it: giving health care providers\n(and others) who use certified health IT certainty that implementing certain health IT features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand functionalities, as well as engaging in certain practices that are beneficial in an EHR-enabled\nhealthcare environment, will not be considered “offering” certified health IT (regardless of who\ndeveloped that health IT) (see 88 FR 23858 and 88 FR 23860).\n\nWe believe that patients generally benefit when independent healthcare professionals\nwho practice in a particular facility participate in such activities as training for use of the\nfacility’s health IT and other equipment. We believe patients also generally benefit when\nindependent healthcare professionals are able to participate in a facility’s clinical education\nactivities, and we note that this includes the independent clinician conducting or leading clinical\neducation or quality improvement activities in a facility for or with other professionals. Quality\nimprovement and clinical education activities conducted in, but not necessarily by, the healthcare\nfacility could include activities that occur in the facility that are partly or largely conducted by\nthird parties (such as a professional specialty society, Patient Safety Organization (PSO),<sup>241</sup>\nMedicare’s Quality Innovation Network – Quality Improvement Organization (QIN-QIO),<sup>242</sup>\npublic health authorities (federal, state, or tribal), or similar entities). Prior to issuing the HTI-1\nproposed rule, we had not had indications that healthcare facilities were experiencing uncertainty\nspecific to allowing independent healthcare professionals to use the facility’s systems in the\ncourse of clinical education or quality improvement activities in the facility—which could, from\n\n\nFootnote 241:\nPatient Safety Organizations (PSOs) collect and analyze data voluntarily reported by healthcare providers to help\nimprove patient safety and healthcare quality. PSOs provide feedback to healthcare providers aimed at promoting\nlearning and preventing future patient safety events. Under the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005\n(the Patient Safety Act), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) certifies and lists PSOs.\n\n(https://pso.ahrq.gov/, retrieved Nov 24, 2023.)\n\n\nFootnote 242:\nAdministered by CMS, the Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) Program is one of the largest federal\nprograms dedicated to improving health quality for Medicare beneficiaries. The QIO Program’s Quality Innovation\nNetwork-QIOs (QIN-QIOs) bring Medicare beneficiaries, providers, and communities together in data-driven\ninitiatives that increase patient safety, make communities healthier, better coordinate post-hospital care, and improve\nclinical quality. By serving regions of two to six states each, QIN-QIOs are able to help best practices for better care\nspread more quickly, while still accommodating local conditions and cultural factors.\n\n(https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/quality-improvement-organizations, retrieved Nov 24, 2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\na health IT perspective, potentially make use of pre-production, production, or a mix of\nproduction and pre-production instance(s) of one or more system(s) or application(s).\n\nBased on comments received in response to our proposing subparagraph (2)(v), we are\nconcerned that codifying subparagraph (2)(v) with wording that explicitly references only\nfurnishing, documenting, and billing for care in the facility would risk creating new uncertainty\nspecific to independent professionals’ use of a facility’s health IT in the course of quality\nimprovement and clinical education activities in the facility. By explicitly referencing clinical\neducation and quality improvement activities conducted by or in a facility in addition to\nexplicitly referencing furnishing, documenting, and accurately billing for care an independent\nhealthcare professional furnishes to patients in a facility, we believe the finalized wording of\nsubparagraph (v) is beneficial.\n\nWe reiterate, however, that the holding out, provision, or supply of health IT for\ndeployment by or for other individual(s) or entity(ies) is not encompassed by any subparagraph\nof the implementation and use activities exclusion (paragraph (2)). (Again, we refer readers to\nthe discussion of deployment versus use of health IT in section IV.B.1 of this preamble.)\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In defining what it means to offer health information technology or offer health IT, we\nalso considered whether it would be beneficial to explicitly establish an exclusion of certain\nmanagement consulting services that play important roles in some providers’ approaches to\noperational management of their practice, clinic, or facility. The bundled exclusions we proposed\nin paragraph (3) of the offer health IT definition address “consulting and legal services,”\nincluding:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• legal services furnished by attorneys that are not in-house counsel<sup>243</sup>\nof the provider\n(commonly referred to as “outside counsel”);\n• health IT expert consultants’ services engaged to help a health IT customer/user (such as\na health care provider) define their business needs and/or evaluate, select, negotiate for or\noversee configuration, implementation, and/or operation of a health IT product that the\nconsultant does not sell/resell, license/relicense, or otherwise supply to the customer; and\n• clinician practice or other health care provider administrative or operational management\nconsultant services where the clinician practice or other health care provider’s\nadministrative or operational management consulting firm effectively stands in the shoes\nof the provider in dealings with the health IT developer or commercial vendor, and\nmanages the day-to-day operations and administrative duties for health IT and its use\nalongside other administrative and operational functions that would otherwise fall on the\nclinician practice or other health care provider’s partners, owner(s), or staff.\n\nWe refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23860 through 23864) for\ndiscussion and examples of services that would be excluded under each of subparagraphs (3)(i)\nthrough (3)(iii) of the proposed offer health IT definition.\n\n*Comments.* Six commenters referenced this exclusion and expressed general support for\nthe proposal. Some, however, recommended specific modifications or clarifications to the\ndescribed activities. (Comments specific to each particular subparagraph of paragraph (3), the\nconsulting and legal services exclusion, are summarized below.)\n\n\nFootnote 243:\nAs noted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (see 88 FR 23860 and 23861 (footnote 407)), in-house counsel would for\npurposes of the offer definition be considered “employees” of the provider. Furnishing use of the provider’s health IT\nto in-house counsel would no more be an offer of that health IT than would be furnishing use of that same health IT\nto members of the provider’s nursing or medical records staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ sharing their perspectives on this proposal through\nthe public comment process. We have finalized the consulting and legal services exclusion\n(paragraph 3) with minor clarifications and revisions to each subparagraph, as discussed in detail\nbelow under sub-headings specific to each of these subparagraphs.\n\nLegal services furnished by outside counsel\nAt subparagraph (3)(i) in the proposed offer health IT definition, we proposed to\nexplicitly exclude legal services furnished by outside counsel (88 FR 23861). As we explained,\nthis proposed exclusion would: codify how we already view, in the context of the definitions\ncurrently codified in § 171.102, legal services furnished by outside counsel in certain matters and\nremove an ambiguity that could, at least in theory, otherwise have unintended effects on how\nparties may in the future assess the best available options and mechanisms for efficient,\ncooperative discovery. The proposed exclusion for legal services furnished by outside counsel,\nlike the proposed exclusion of health IT expert consulting services, would focus on the services\nprovided and not on the type of organization providing them (88 FR 23861).\n\n*Comments.* Several comments expressing support for the consulting and legal services\nexclusion (subparagraph (3)(i)) acknowledged the explicit exclusion of legal services furnished\nby outside counsel. No comments expressed opposition or concern and no comments\nrecommended particular revisions or clarifications to the legal services description in\nsubparagraph (3)(i).\n\n*Response.* After considering comments received on the offer health IT definition and the\nconsulting and legal services exclusion, we have finalized subparagraph (3)(i) of legal services\nfurnished by outside counsel arrangements. We have, however, revised the text of subparagraph\n(3)(i) to remove unnecessary words and improve readability. These revisions are detailed below,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunder the summary of finalized policy – consulting and legal services exclusion (paragraph (3))\nheading.\n\nHealth IT consultant assistance with selection, implementation, and use of health IT\nAt subparagraph (3)(ii) in the proposed offer health information technology or offer\nhealth IT definition, we proposed to explicitly exclude the work of health IT expert consultants\nengaged to help a health IT customer/user (such as a health care provider, health plan, or\nHIN/HIE) do any or all of the following with respect to any health IT product that the consultant\ndoes not sell or resell, license or relicense, or otherwise supply to the customer under any\narrangement on a commercial basis or otherwise: define their business needs; evaluate or select\nhealth IT product(s); negotiate for the purchase, lease, license, or other arrangement under which\nthe health IT product(s) will be used; or oversee configuration, implementation, or operation of a\nhealth IT product(s) (88 FR 23862).\n\n*Comments.* Comments regarding the arrangements described in subparagraph (ii) of the\nconsulting and legal services exclusion (paragraph 3) were generally supportive. Several\ncomments recommended clarification as to whether the description encompassed the full scope\nof informatics consulting practice. One of these comments requested additional detail as to\nspecific domains and tasks within the practice of clinical informatics. Several comments\nrequested clarification as to whether the exclusion applied to a consultant configuring,\nimplementing, or operating health IT on the customer’s behalf, or whether it was limited to a\nconsultant overseeing such activities conducted by others.\n\n*Response.* After consideration of comments received, we have finalized the description of\nhealth IT consultant assistance arrangements in subparagraph (3)(ii) with revised wording to\nprovide additional clarity. Specifically, we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• clarified the wording of the subparagraph’s heading to read “health IT consultant\nassistance with selection, implementation, and use of health IT” (in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23915) the omission of the word “with” was a typographical\nerror, which we believe made the heading less readable); and\n• modified the wording of subparagraph (3)(ii)(C) from “oversee” to “oversee or carry\nout” so that the exclusion’s wording explicitly includes carrying out as well as\noverseeing configuration, implementation, or operation of health IT products.\n\nWe believe the revised wording (“oversee or carry out”) in subparagraph (3)(ii)(C)\nprovides certainty and clarity to clinical or biomedical informaticists and other consultants that\nthey can take an active role in configuring, implementing, or operating health IT on the\ncustomer’s behalf, as well as or instead of overseeing such activities conducted by others,\nwithout the consultant’s activities meeting the definition of offer health IT.\n\nAs proposed and now finalized, subparagraph (3)(ii) is agnostic to what specific domains\nof expertise, or what specific knowledge, skills, or abilities, the consultant might apply to any of\nthe activities described in subparagraphs (3)(ii)(A) through (C) with respect to any health IT\nproduct(s) that the consultant does not hold out or supply to the customer under any arrangement.\n\nWe do not at this time believe it is necessary to limit the applicability of subparagraph (3)(ii) by\nadding to it a catalog of specific domains in which a health informaticist might be practicing\nwhen, or in order to be considered to be, engaged in activities described in any of subparagraphs\n(3)(ii)(A) through (C) under arrangements consistent with subparagraph (3)(ii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition of “health informatics” that is often attributed to the National Library of\nMedicine<sup>244</sup>\nindicates that “health informatics” is “the interdisciplinary study of the design,\ndevelopment, adoption and application of IT-based innovations in healthcare services delivery,\nmanagement and planning.”<sup>245</sup>\nIn our observation, there is today considerable heterogeneity in\nwhat health informaticists do, how they do it, and under what arrangements they engage with\nemployers, customers, or clients. Therefore, we believe it would be more cumbersome than\nhelpful to attempt to catalog all, and difficult to identify an appropriately representative\nsampling, of the tasks that a practitioner of health informatics might oversee or conduct without\nthemselves selling, reselling, licensing, relicensing, or otherwise supplying the customer with\nhealth IT that includes one or more Health IT Modules certified under the Program. Such a\ncatalog of tasks or domains of health informatics practice would risk rapidly becoming more\nlimiting than we intend the exclusion to be. Therefore, we decline to do so. Instead, we\nemphasize that whether any activity or conduct in the course of practicing clinical, biomedical,\npublic health, or any other variation of health informatics (or any other profession) is\nencompassed by the consulting and legal services exclusion under subparagraph (3)(ii) depends\non whether the activity or conduct is consistent with subparagraph (3)(ii).\n\n\nFootnote 244:\nSee e.g., University of Michigan School of Information (https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-health-\ninformatics, retrieved 10/25/2023); University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences blog post\n“Why Health Informatics Is Its Own Discipline,” Oct. 7, 2021 (https://online.shrs.pitt.edu/blog/why-health-\ninformatics-is-its-own-discipline/, retrieved Oct. 25, 2023).\n\n\nFootnote 245:\nThe definition including this quote appeared in frequently asked questions (FAQs) for “Health Services Research\nInformation Central” updated Apr. 23, 2014, on a web page of the National Library of Medicine’s National\nInformation Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR).

[1 paragraph].” (https://wayback.archive-\nit.org/7189/20170515160548/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/hsric_topic_definitions.html, retrieved Oct. 25,\n2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reiterate that if an individual or entity who engages in an activity or arrangement\nencompassed by an exclusion from the offer health IT definition happens to otherwise be an\n§ 171.102 actor, that individual or entity is an actor subject to the information blocking provision\nin section 3022 of the PHSA. If such actor engages in conduct that meets the definition of\ninformation blocking in § 171.103, that actor could be subject to enforcement action under the\ninformation blocking provision in section 3022 of the PHSA even if they engaged in the\npractice(s) meeting the information blocking definition in the course of an activity that would\nnot, itself, meet the offer health IT definition.\n\nFor example, a clinical informaticist who is a doctor of medicine (MD) or osteopathy\n(DO) might provide consulting services consistent with subparagraph (3)(ii) of the offer health\nIT definition. The services in this example do not meet the offer health IT definition. Therefore,\nthese services do not cause the informaticist to meet the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition. But the clinical informaticist, as an MD or DO, meets the § 171.102 definition of a\nhealth care provider. Thus, the physician in this example is a § 171.102 actor and, were this\nphysician to be determined by OIG to have committed information blocking, the physician\nwould be subject to appropriate disincentives consistent with section 3022(b)(2)(B) of the PHSA.\n\nIf, however, an individual or entity who practices “health informatics” is not otherwise a\n§ 171.102 health care provider, health IT developer of certified health IT, or HIN/HIE, and\nwould only meet the § 171.102 actor definition by offering health IT chooses to only engage in\nconduct that does not meet the offer health IT definition, then the individual or entity would not\nbe considered an actor.\n\nComprehensive and predominantly non-health IT administrative or operations\nmanagement services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn subparagraph (3)(iii), we proposed to exclude from the offer health IT definition\ncomprehensive clinician practice or other health care provider administrative or operational\nmanagement consultant services where the administrative or operational management consulting\nfirm effectively stands in the shoes of the provider in dealings with the health IT developer or\ncommercial vendor, and manages the day-to-day operations and administrative duties for health\nIT and its use alongside a comprehensive array of other administrative and operational functions\nthat would otherwise fall on the clinician practice or other health care provider’s partners,\nowner(s), or staff (88 FR 23862).\n\nAlone among the three proposed exclusions of consulting and legal services\narrangements, the exclusion of clinician practice or other health care provider administrative or\noperational management consulting services would be likely to include arrangements where the\nhealth IT deployed by or for the health care provider is supplied to them by the consultant — for\nexample, as part of a comprehensive (“turn key”) package of practice management or other\nprovider administrative or operations management services. In proposing the exclusion from the\noffer health IT definition of the activities specified in subparagraph(3)(iii), we noted its\nimplication for health care providers’ accountability for acts or omissions of their consultants\noperating under the exception — particularly health care providers’ administrative or operational\nmanagement services consultants — that implicate the definition of information blocking in\n§ 171.103 (88 FR 23862). We refer readers to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule for the rationale for the\ncomprehensive and predominantly non-health IT management services exclusion and\nexplanation of how it operates (88 FR 23862 through 23864). The explanation includes the key\nfactors that differentiate excluded clinician practice or other health care provider administrative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor operational management consultant services from IT managed service provider (MSP)\nservices and arrangements (88 FR 23863).\n\nThe HTI-1 Proposed Rule preamble discussion may include one or more instances of a\ntypographical error in how subparagraph (iii) of exclusion (3) is referenced. This typographical\nerror results in citing the paragraph as (3)(c) instead of (3)(iii). These typographical errors in how\nthe paragraph is cited in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule preamble have no bearing on the substance of\nthe proposal.\n\nWe solicited comment on this proposal, including specifically whether:\n• this exclusion is more beneficial than harmful or confusing to the public, including the\nregulated community (health care providers, other information blocking “actors,” and\nthose who may be more likely to be considered a “health IT developer of certified health\nIT” in the absence of this exclusion); and\n• different or additional criteria should factor into differentiating whether a particular\narrangement is a practice/operational management services arrangement that happens to\ninclude health IT as one of many necessities to operate as a health care provider rather\nthan an arrangement for the supply of health IT that happens to include additional\nservices (88 FR 23864).\n\n*Comments.* We received comments discussing or referencing the proposal to exclude\narrangements for comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT clinician practice or other\nhealth care provider administrative or operations management services from four commenters.\n\nNo comments expressed opposition to excluding these activities from the offer health IT\ndefinition. One comment expressed appreciation for the clarity the proposal provides. Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomments recommended revising the exclusion to encompass additional types of arrangements.\n\nOne comment advocated changing the effect of an activity’s exclusion so that an individual or\nentity that meets the actor definition through other activities (such as by participating as a\ndeveloper in the Program) would not be considered an actor while engaging in the excluded\nactivity. One commenter shared thoughts specifically in response to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule’s\nprompt for comments on potential benefits and harms of the proposal and potential additional\ncriteria for differentiating between a practice/operational management services arrangement that\nhappens to include health IT and an arrangement for the supply of health IT that happens to\ninclude additional services.\n\n*Response.* Upon consideration of comments received, we have finalized the exclusion of\ncomprehensive and predominantly non-health IT clinician practice or other health care provider\nadministrative or operations management services (subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (3)). We have\nrevised the wording of subparagraph (3)(iii) to improve its readability and clarity. We summarize\nand respond to specific, detailed comments below.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter advocated that we expand the exclusion to explicitly\nencompass reselling and hosting certified health IT under a particular vendor-specific model.\n\n*Response.* A health care provider who wishes to stand in the shoes of another provider in\ndealings with the health IT developer or commercial vendor, in managing the day-to-day\noperations and administrative duties for the health IT, or both, as part of a comprehensive array\nof predominantly non-health IT administrative and operational functions, can do so without\nmeeting the offer health IT definition. Such conduct would be excluded from the offer health IT\ndefinition to the extent the arrangement is consistent with the comprehensive and predominantly\nnon-health IT management services exclusion (subparagraph (3)(iii)). We refer readers to the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule explanation of the key factors that differentiate excluded clinician practice\nor other health care provider administrative or operational management consultant services from\nIT managed service provider (MSP) services and arrangements (88 FR 23863). Although this\ndiscussion of key factors includes an instance of the typographical error whereby subparagraph\n(3)(iii) is cited as “(3)(c)”, the key factors discussed (88 FR 23863) apply to the arrangements\ndescribed by subparagraph (3)(iii), as proposed and as now finalized.\n\nWe discuss in context of the health IT developer of certified health IT definition\npreamble below (section IV.B.2) additional concerns we would have for a potential policy under\nwhich health care providers who choose to sell or resell certified health IT under additional types\nof arrangements would not be considered health IT developers of certified health IT. Because of\nthese concerns (discussed in IV.B.2, below) we do not believe it would be appropriate to expand\nthe exclusions from the offer health IT definition to include the vendor-specific resale model\ncited by this commenter.\n\n*Comments.* Some comments cited potential risks, such as of anti-competitive effects or\nconflicts of interest arising as a result of exclusions potentially encouraging entities in the health\nsector or beyond to develop consulting operations to supply health IT to customers without the\nconsulting operation being subject to the information blocking regulations, as compared to\nentities that offer similar services but also meet the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition. A comment recommended we ensure sufficient protections are in place but did not\nsuggest specific additional criteria or considerations for determining which arrangements are or\nshould be encompassed by the comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT management\nservices exclusion (subparagraph (3)(iii) and which should instead meet the offer health IT\ndefinition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate receiving a response to our request for comment on these\npoints. Subparagraph (3)(iii) explicitly indicates that the consultant providing these services acts\nas the agent of the health care provider or otherwise on behalf of the health care provider in\ndealings with the health IT developer or vendor, day-to-day operations and administration of the\nhealth IT, or both. This means that for any (individual or entity) consultant’s services to be\nconsistent with subparagraph (3)(iii), the consultant cannot also be the developer of any included\nhealth IT items or services. For subparagraph (3)(iii) to apply, the consultant also must explicitly\nprovide comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT administrative or operations\nmanagement services. Thus, the exclusion cannot apply if the consultant is simply furnishing\nhealth IT managed service provider (MSP) services and arrangements or any bundle of\nexclusively or predominantly health IT items and services to the health care provider.\n\nWe believe excluded bundles of predominantly non-health IT services are distinguishable\nfrom health IT MSP services and arrangements and bundles of predominantly health IT items\nand services based on their characteristics. For an arrangement to be consistent with the\ncomprehensive and predominantly non-health IT management services exclusion (subparagraph\n(3)(iii)), the bundle of business administrative and operational management services must\ndemonstrate all of the differentiating factors described at 88 FR 23863:\n• The individual or entity furnishing the administrative or operational management\nconsulting services acts as the agent of the provider or otherwise on behalf of<sup>246</sup>\nthe\n\n\nFootnote 246:\nAt 88 FR 23863, we used “stands in the shoes of” instead of “on behalf of, to parallel the wording of the\nsubparagraph as presented in the Proposed Rule. We have updated the statement of this factor here to match the\nwording of the finalized subparagraph (3)(iii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovider in dealings with the health IT developer(s) or commercial vendor(s) from which\nthe health IT the client health care providers ultimately use is obtained;\n• The administrative or operational management consulting services must be a package or\nbundle of services provided by the same individual or entity and under the same contract\nor other binding instrument, and the package or bundle of services must include a\ncomprehensive array of business administration functions, operations management\nfunctions, or a combination of these functions that would otherwise be executed by the\nhealth care provider;<sup>247</sup>\n• The bundle of business administrative and operational management consulting services\nmust include multiple items and services that are not health information technology as\ndefined in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5); and\n• The non-health IT services must represent more than half of each of –\no the person hours per year the consultant (individual or entity) bills or otherwise\napplies to the services bundle (including cost allocations consistent with Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles), and\no the total cost to the client for, or billing from, the consultant per year (including pass-\nthrough costs for the health IT items and services).\n\nThese factors that differentiate comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT\nmanagement services tailor subparagraph (3)(iii) so that it cannot be satisfied by a simple\n\n\nFootnote 247:\nAt 88 FR 23863, we referenced one example type of health care provider (clinician practice) and various roles\nindividuals might have within health care provider organizations. We also used the more colloquial “fall on” than\n“be executed by.” We used that wording at 88 FR 23863 to parallel the wording of the subparagraph as presented in\nthe Proposed Rule. We have updated the statement of this factor here to match the wording of the finalized\nsubparagraph (3)(iii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrebranding of health IT resale models or managed service provider (MSP) services or by tacking\na few non-health IT service(s) onto a bundle of predominantly (half or more) health IT items and\nservices. Thus, we believe subparagraph (3)(iii) as finalized is appropriately tailored to guard\nagainst misuse of the exclusion in the market today.\n\nWe recognize, however, the potential for the market to evolve in ways that would\nincrease risk of unintended consequences or abuse of this exclusion from the offer health IT\ndefinition. Although we have finalized the exclusion of arrangements consistent with\nsubparagraph (3)(iii) without limiting its applicability based on characteristics, features, or\nfactors beyond those we proposed, we note that we may consider amending the offer health IT\ndefinition (including any or all of its exclusions) in future rulemaking in response to experience\nwith the definition in practice or other appropriate factors such as changing market conditions.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter that is a commercial developer of certified health IT advocated\nthat entities otherwise meeting the health IT developer of certified health IT definition should be\nable to operate a consulting entity that would engage in conduct excluded from the offer health\nIT definition without the consulting entity’s conduct in the course of those activities implicating\nthe developer as an actor. The commenter suggested that a developer could otherwise be at a\ncompetitive disadvantage specific to these consulting services compared to consulting entities\nthat engage only in activities excluded from the offer health IT definition and do not otherwise\nmeet the health IT developer of certified health IT definition.\n\n*Response.* Achieving the effect recommended by this comment would require altering the\nstructure and nature of the health IT developer of certified health IT definition rather than the\noffer health IT definition. Such modification of the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition would be beyond the scope of the wording update we proposed in the HTI-1 Proposed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule (see 88 FR 23864 and 23915). Therefore, we interpret the comment primarily as a response\nto our Request for Information on whether we should consider proposing in future rulemaking\nany additional exclusions from the offer health IT definition (section IV.C.1 of the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, starting at 88 FR 23873). We summarize and respond to this specific comment\nhere because we believe, in light of comments received from the health IT customer community\n(including one addressed immediately below), it may be helpful to both health IT developers of\ncertified health IT and their customers for us to provide an overview of certain features and\nimplications of the information blocking regulations within which the finalized subparagraph\n(3)(iii) of the offer health IT definition appears.\n\nA baseline feature of information blocking regulations in place since the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25642) is that the health information network or health information exchange\n(HIN/HIE) definition is currently the only § 171.102 actor type definition that is functional. As\nwe stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, “the individual or entity would be considered a\nHIN/HIE under the information blocking regulations for any practice they conducted while\nfunctioning as a HIN/HIE” (85 FR 25802). In contrast, both the health care provider and health\nIT developer of certified health IT definitions in § 171.102 are categorical, in the sense that an\nindividual or entity either meets one of these definitions or they do not. For example, an\nindividual or entity that meets the health IT developer of certified health IT definition in any of\nits activities is considered to be a health IT developer of certified health IT for any of its\npractices that otherwise meet the information blocking definition in 45 CFR 171.103 —\nregardless of whether health IT involved in a specific practice is certified. To read more about\nthe health IT developer of certified health IT definition’s scope, including applicability of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCures Act’s information blocking provision to a developer’s non-certified health IT, please see\nthe ONC Cures Act Final Rule preamble starting at 85 FR 25795.\n\nWe recognize that in a variety of circumstances developers and offerors of certified\nhealth IT have business lines or other entities that market various services also marketed by\ncompetitor entities that do not develop or offer any certified health IT. We also recognize, and\nwould encourage customers to be aware, that any individual or entity that (1) offers health IT\nproducts or consulting services in a way that satisfies the exclusion, (2) does not engage in any\nother conduct within the offer health IT definition, and (3) does not otherwise meet the § 171.102\nactor definition would not be subject to the information blocking regulations.\n\nWe believe any perceived competitive disadvantage a “health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT” may experience as a result of meeting the definition in § 171.102 is offset by\ncustomers’ potential preferences to receive services from consultants who are § 171.102 actors.\n\nFor example, in choosing among otherwise competitive bids from a non-actor and a health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT to serve in a specific consulting role, a customer might weigh as\nfavorable to a vendor or consultant that is a § 171.102 actor the fact that the actor could be\nsubject to enforcement action under section 3022 of the PHSA if (except as required by law or\ncovered by an exception) the actor engages in conduct they know or should know is likely to\ninterfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We also refer readers to the discussion in the\nONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25795 through 25796) of a related concern about the potential\nimpact of the Cures Act’s information blocking provision (42 U.S.C. 300jj–52) on health IT\ndevelopers’ decisions to participate in the Program.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter expressed concern about the risk of customers being uncertain\nas to which entities offering consulting services excluded from the offer health IT definition are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to information blocking regulations and which are not, and about other entities’ ability to\nsupport needs for data sharing within the healthcare space.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenter sharing this concern. We recognize that whether\na consultant has the skills and expertise to deliver what the customer needs and expects for data\nsharing and other activities involving or relying on data, is a foundational question. Answering it,\nwe believe, will continue to be something customers do by assessing prospective consultants’\nqualifications against their specific needs and priorities. Knowing that a consultant is an actor\nsubject to information blocking regulations is a useful piece of information for customers to\nhave, but a consultant meeting the § 171.102 actor definition does not guarantee the consultant\nhas the level of particular knowledge, skills, abilities, or other capacity that the customer wants\nor needs from a consultant or other vendor.\n\nWe also recognize that customers who prefer to obtain services that are excluded from\nthe definition of offer health IT from an entity that is subject to the information blocking\nregulations may need to engage in fact-finding to ascertain the status of entities that provide\nthese services. We note that it may be somewhat easier to identify the actor status of a consultant\nwhere the consultant is also a developer participating in the Program, or a health care provider,\nthan where they are not. This is because, for example, both individual and organizational health\ncare providers must typically be licensed in jurisdiction(s) where they furnish healthcare. Most\nhealth care providers in the United States will also have a National Provider Identifier (NPI).\n\nOnline directories of licensed health care providers are available from or for U.S. states, and\nCMS supports an online search utility for the NPI registry (available to the public free of charge\nat https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/search). Similarly, a search of ONC’s Certified Health IT\nProducts List (CHPL) (https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/search) will indicate whether an entity has\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlisted under its name one or more Health IT Module(s) certified under the Program. By contrast,\nan entity that only resells Health IT Module(s) without having responsibility for the certification\nstatus of any such Health IT Module(s) will not be listed on the CHPL. It is also important to\nremember that entities’ choices to engage in different lines of business under different names\nmay mean that the name under which consulting services are furnished differs from the name(s)\nunder which: a developer of certified health IT is associated with any CHPL-listed product(s); or\nan individual or entity that meets the § 171.102 health care provider definition may be listed in\nany registry, listing, or database of individual and organizational health care providers.\n\nTherefore, a customer may need to refer to additional sources of information, including those\nprovided by the prospective consultant, and may want to consider addressing the consultant’s\n§ 171.102 actor status in the process of selecting the consultant or contracting with the consultant\nfor their services (such as through representations and warranties).\n\nOne expectation we have for the improved clarity provided by the offer health IT\ndefinition is that it will help customers to differentiate between consultants who clearly are\n§ 171.102 actors and those who might not be actors. With this clarity, we believe customers will\nbe in a better position to assess what additional information, representations, or warranties they\nwill require from a consultant before making or finalizing a decision to engage the consultant.\n\nSummary of finalized policy – consulting and legal services exclusion (paragraph (3)):\nAfter considering comments received, we have finalized the substance of the consulting and\nlegal services exclusion. The finalized text of paragraph (3) includes minor revisions to\nsubparagraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) to improve clarity, address a typographical error, and improve\nreadability (as discussed above):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Revised the second sentence of subparagraph (i) to remove unnecessary words, increase\nprecision, and improve readability, as follows:\no Removed unnecessary words from “if or when facilitating limited access or\nuse of the client’s health IT or the EHI within it,” resulting in the revised\nphrase reading “when facilitating limited access or use of the client’s health\nIT.”\no Revised the phrase “to independent expert witnesses engaged by counsel” for\nreadability and precision to read, as revised: “by independent expert witnesses\nengaged by the outside counsel.”\no Revised the final phrase of the sentence from “as necessary or appropriate to\nlegal discovery” to “as appropriate to legal discovery.”\n\n• Revised the wording of the subparagraph (3)(ii) heading to read “health IT consultant\nassistance with selection, implementation, and use of health IT,” correcting the\ntypographical error that had omitted “with” from the text as published in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (88 FR 23915).\n\n• Revised the wording of subparagraph (3)(ii) to improve readability by removing\nunnecessary reference to services being potentially provided by an individual or a firm,\nand to “expert.” As discussed in response to comments, subparagraph (3)(ii) applies to\nthe activities it describes. Application of subparagraph (3)(ii) does not depend on the\nconsultant having or applying specific type(s) or level(s) of expertise, knowledge, or\nskills in furnishing expert services to help the customer do (or do for the customer) the\nactivities described in subparagraph (3)(ii)(A) through (C). The revision is from the HTI-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Proposed Rule’s wording “… provided by an individual or firm when furnishing expert\nadvice and consulting services to a health IT customer or user that help the customer or\nuser, or on the customer's behalf, do …” to “… advice and consulting services furnished\nto a health IT customer or user to do (or on behalf of a customer or user does).”\n\n• Revised wording of subparagraph (3)(ii)(A) to improve readability, from “define the\ncustomer or user business needs; evaluate or select health IT product(s),” as presented in\nthe HTI-1 Proposed Rule, to the finalized wording of: “define the business needs of the\ncustomer or user or evaluate health IT product(s) against such business needs, or both.”\n\n• In response to public comments, modified the wording of subparagraph (3)(ii)(C) from\n“oversee” to “oversee or carry out” so that, on its face, the wording provides immediate\nand explicit clarity that the exclusion encompasses carrying out as well as overseeing\nconfiguration, implementation, or operation of health IT products.\n\n• To improve readability of subparagraph (3)(iii), we have revised its wording in the\nfollowing ways:\no Split the paragraph into two sentences instead of one. The second sentence, as\nfinalized, opens with “To be consistent with this subparagraph, such services\nmust be furnished” to connect this to the preceding paragraph and ensure it\nremains clear that services are not consistent with subparagraph (3)(iii) unless\nthey are furnished as part of a comprehensive array of predominantly non-\nhealth IT services (as discussed above, in responses to comments).\no From the first revised sentence, removed unnecessary reference to clinician\npractice and other unnecessary words to improve readability. This change is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom “provided by an individual or entity when furnishing a clinician practice\nor other health care provider administrative or operational management\nconsultant services where the management consultant acts as the agent of the\nprovider or otherwise” to the finalized wording: “when an individual or entity\nfurnishes a health care provider with administrative or operational\nmanagement consultant services and the management consultant acts as the\nagent of the provider or otherwise.”\no Replaced in the first finalized sentence of the subparagraph the phrase “stands\nin the shoes of the provider” with less colloquial phrase “acts on behalf of the\nprovider.”\no Revised description of dealings with health IT developers and vendors to\nstrike unnecessary adjective (“commercial”) and improve facial clarity that\nthe dealings could be with one or more developers or vendors. This change in\ntext is from “in dealings with the health IT developer or commercial vendor”\nto “in dealings with one or more health IT developer(s) or vendor(s).”\no At the end of what is, as finalized, the first sentence of the subparagraph, we\nreplaced “and/or in managing the day-to-day operations and administrative\nduties for the health IT,” with “or managing the day-to-day operations and\nadministrative duties for the health IT, or both.”\no Replaced in the second clause of the finalized second sentence of the\nsubparagraph the phrase “fall on” with less colloquial phrase “be executed by”\nand struck unnecessary reference to a specific type of health care provider\nentity, and unnecessary reference to different roles within provider\n\n\n\n\n\n\norganizations. The affected portion of the subparagraph as presented in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule read: “as part of a comprehensive array of\npredominantly non-health IT administrative and operational functions that\nwould otherwise fall on the clinician practice or other health care provider's\npartners, owner(s), or staff.” As a result of the revisions described here, the\nsecond sentence of the subparagraph reads as a whole: “To be consistent with\nthis subparagraph, such services must be furnished as part of a comprehensive\narray of predominantly non-health IT administrative and operational functions\nthat would otherwise be executed by the health care provider.”\n\nWe reiterate here, because we believe it is worth amplifying, a point we noted in the HTI-\n1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23862) specific to the comprehensive and predominantly non-health IT\nmanagement services arrangements (subparagraph (3)(iii)). That point is its implication for\nhealth care providers' accountability for acts or omissions of health care providers' administrative\nor operational management services consultants operating under the exception that implicate the\ndefinition of information blocking in § 171.103: where an administrative or operations\nmanagement services firm would not be considered to offer health IT for which they contract on\nbehalf of one or more practices (or facilities or sites of care) because they are acting as the\nprovider's agent or otherwise standing in the shoes of the provider in selecting and contracting\nfor a variety of services and supplies—including, but not limited to, the health IT that includes at\nleast one certified Health IT Module—we would view the provider as retaining accountability\nfor any information blocking conduct that the management services company perpetrates while\nthus acting on the provider's behalf. We recognize this may have implications for how providers\nmay wish to structure administrative and operational services contracts in the future, potentially\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincluding a provider seeking representations and warranties giving the provider assurance that\nthe administrative or operations management services company will not, without the provider's\ndirection, knowledge, or approval, engage in any practice not required by law or covered by an\ninformation blocking exception that is likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI\nand could be unreasonable. However, subparagraph (3)(iii) of the consulting and legal services\nexclusion from the offer health IT definition is not intended to have the effect of regulating or\notherwise interfering with contracting relationships between health care providers and entities\nthat do, or might, furnish them with practice, facility, location, or site management consulting\nand operational services packages.\n\nWe also remind, again, any individual or entity otherwise meeting the § 171.102 actor\ndefinition that engaging in activities that are explicitly excluded from the offer health IT\ndefinition under paragraph (1), (2), or (3), will not change the fact that they are a § 171.102\nactor. Where an individual or entity meets the actor definition, that actor’s having also engaged\nin any one or more activities that satisfies an exclusion from the offer health IT definition does\nnot mean the individual or entity is no longer an actor. The fact that an actor may engage in some\nconduct that is consistent with an explicit exclusion from the offer health IT definition does not\nmean that conduct on the actor’s part is not subject to the information blocking definition. The\nfact that particular conduct of an individual or entity meets any exclusion from the offer health\nIT definition only means that specific conduct does not meet the definition of offer health IT.\n\n\n",

              "title": "2. Health IT Developer of Certified Health IT: Self-developer Health Care Providers",
              "text": "For reasons discussed in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25799 through 25800),\nhealth care providers who self-develop certified health IT “for their own use” were excluded\nfrom the health IT developer of certified health IT definition. However, under that definition, if a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth care provider responsible for the certification status of any Health IT Module(s) were to\noffer or supply those Health IT Module(s) on any terms to other entities for those entities' use in\ntheir own independent operations, that would be inconsistent with the concept of the health care\nprovider self-developing health IT “for its own use.” As we explained in the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (at 85 FR 25799), we use the term “self-developer” in this context as the term has\nbeen used in the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) and as described in section\nVII.D.7 of the Cures Act Proposed Rule (at 84 FR 7507).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, informed by our proposal to define “offer health IT,” we\nproposed to modify the health IT developer of certified health IT definition in § 171.102. To\nensure it would be immediately clear from the face of the regulations’ text that we had put all\nhealth care providers that engage in activities consistent with the exclusions in paragraphs (1)\nthrough (3) of the offer health IT definition on the same footing regardless of who develops the\nhealth IT involved in these activities, we proposed to replace in the health IT developer of\ncertified health IT definition the phrase “other than a health care provider that self-develops\nhealth IT for its own use” with the phrase “other than a health care provider that self-develops\nhealth IT not offered to others” (See 88 FR 23864).\n\n*Comments.* A majority of comments specific to this proposal supported the proposal.\n\nSeveral comments stated that self-developer health care providers should not be considered\nhealth IT developers of certified health IT. Several comments stated that self-developer health\ncare providers who offer health IT should be included health IT developers of certified health IT\ndefinition alongside other individuals and entities that offer certified health IT.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all comments received. Having considered the comments, we\nhave finalized our proposal to align the self-developer health care provider exclusion from the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT developer of certified health IT definition with our finalized definition of “offer health\nIT.” Stated another way, health care providers who self-develop certified health IT that is not\noffered to others are excluded from the health IT developer of certified health IT definition\nunless they “offer health IT” as now defined in § 171.102. We have made one revision to the\nwording of the finalized updated text of the definition for readability, specifically from “other\nthan a health care provider that self-develops health IT not offered to others” to “other than a\nhealth care provider that self-develops health IT that is not offered to others.” We summarize and\nrespond to additional comments related to the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition below.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments advocating that we exclude all providers who\nhost EHRs for other providers (sometimes characterizing it as extending the host provider’s\nEHR) from the health IT developer of certified health IT definition. These comments have been\ndiscussed in section IV.B.1 because several of them discussed this recommendation as an\nextension, clarification, or addition to the proposed exclusions from the offer health IT\ndefinition. Some commenters, however, connected the suggestion to the health IT developer of\ncertified health IT definition. Commenters’ rationales for excluding from the health IT developer\nof certified health IT definition health care providers who “extend their EHRs” or otherwise\nprovide certified health IT to other providers included: health care providers are already actors\nunder the information blocking regulations (§ 171.102); recipient providers would be unable to\nafford interoperable health IT obtained from other sources; and the developer should be held\naccountable for design defects in health IT. Several other commenters, representing the health\ncare provider as well as the ONC Health IT Certification Program-participating developer\nperspectives, explicitly supported our proposal to have all entities that offer health IT (as we\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhave defined such action) continue to meet the definition of health IT developers of certified\nhealth IT regardless of whether such health IT was self-developed or obtained from a third-party\ndeveloper.\n\n*Response.* Whether done by a health care provider or anyone else, hosting EHR systems,\notherwise providing or supplying health IT items and services, or holding out any certified health\nIT to health care providers generally meets the offer health IT definition. Such actions are\nexcluded from the offer health IT definition only when and to the extent it is consistent with\nsubparagraph (3)(iii) of the offer health IT definition. Any individual or entity, regardless of\nwhether they also meet the § 171.102 definition of health care provider, who engage in conduct\nmeeting the offer health IT definition meet the health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition on the basis of that conduct.\n\nWe had not proposed, and we have not made, revisions to “carve out” health care\nproviders who offer health IT from the health IT developer of certified health IT definition. We\nincluded in section IV.C.1 of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23873) a request for information\non additional exclusions from the offer health IT definition but did not propose to exclude supply\nof health IT for deployment by or for others from the offer health IT definition based on the\nsupplier being a health care provider. Further, as noted above, we received comments supporting\nthe health IT developer of certified health IT approach we proposed. Therefore, any further\nexclusions from the offer health IT definition are deferred for future consideration.\n\nRegarding concerns about design flaws in the software created by the developer of\ncertified health IT, as a § 171.102 actor, the developer would be subject to information blocking\npenalties for software design flaws to the extent such flaws constitute information blocking. As\nwe did in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (see 85 FR 25798 through 25799), we again refer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenters concerned about holding offerors that do not develop health IT accountable for the\nconduct of the developer (or others) to section 3022(a)(6) of the PHSA, which states that the\nterm “information blocking,” with respect to an individual or entity, shall not include an act or\npractice other than an act or practice committed by such individual or entity. Where the\nindividual or entity that develops health IT is different from the individual or entity that offers\ncertified health IT, each such individual or entity is only liable for the acts and practices that it\ncommits.\n\nIn the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25798-25800), we explained that any that any\nindividual or entity that develops health IT, except for health care providers that self-developed\ncertified health IT for their own use, meet the definition of health IT developer of certified health\nIT while they have one or more Health IT Modules certified under the ONC Health IT\nCertification Program. We also explained that individuals or entities meet the health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT definition if they offer certified health IT. This remains true with\nthe conclusion of this rulemaking. Under the policies finalized in this rule, any individual or\nentity, including a self-developer health care provider or any other health care provider, that\noffers health IT (as defined in § 171.102) meets the definition of health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested that we clarify what the term health care provider\nmeans as used within the health IT developer of certified health IT definition.\n\n*Response.* The term health care provider is defined for purposes of the information\nblocking regulations in 45 CFR 171.102. To help interested parties better understand the\ndefinition, we make information blocking resources available through our website, HealthIT.gov.\n\nThese resources include a fact sheet titled “Health Care Provider Definition” that provides, in a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle document, a copy of the full text of the health care provider statutory definition (PHSA\nsection 3000) cited in § 171.102 and the text of statutory cross-references within the PHSA\nsection 3000 definition of health care provider.<sup>248</sup>\nSummary of finalized policy – health IT developer of certified health IT definition: After\nconsideration of comments received, we have finalized the revision to the definition\nsubstantively as proposed. We have made a non-substantive change to the wording of the\nfinalized revised definition of health IT developer of certified health IT in comparison to the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule; specifically, in the clause excluding self-developer health care providers\nto the extent their self-developed health IT is not offered to others. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule,\nthat clause read: “other than a health care provider that self-develops health IT not offered to\nothers.” As finalized, we added “that is” immediately before “not offered to others” to improve\nreadability of the finalized text.\n\nWe emphasize that any individual or entity that chooses to offer health IT (as defined in\n§ 171.102) will meet the finalized revised § 171.102 health IT developer of certified health IT\ndefinition regardless of who developed the certified health IT that the individual or entity offers\nto others, and regardless of whether the health IT is offered at or below cost, market rate, or other\nbenchmark price for the same or similar health IT items or services. This includes individuals\nand entities that offer health IT while also meeting the definition of health care provider, as both\nterms are defined in § 171.102, regardless of whether such individuals or entities also self-\ndevelop any health IT (certified or otherwise) deployed only within their own organization or\n\n\nFootnote 248:\nHealth Care Provider Definition and Cross-Reference Table, available at:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page2/2020-08/Health_Care_Provider_Definitions_v3.pdf (Retrieved Jun\n28, 2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\noperations. Regarding health care providers who might engage in activities consistent with one\nor more exclusion(s) from the offer health IT definition without also engaging in activities or\narrangements that meet the offer health IT definition, we note that all such health care providers\nwill stand on the same footing regardless of whether they also self-develop health IT that is not\noffered to others.\n\n\n",

              "text": "As finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642) and the Cures Act Interim\nFinal Rule (85 FR 70085), the information blocking definition (§ 171.103) and the Content and\nManner Exception (§ 171.301(a)) were limited for a period of time to a subset of EHI that was\nnarrower than the EHI definition finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule in § 171.102. The\nnarrower subset included only the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the United\nStates Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) for the first 18 months (until May 2, 2022) after\nthe applicability date for 45 CFR part 171 (November 2, 2020) (85 FR 25792). The Cures Act\nInterim Final Rule extended the applicability date of 45 CFR part 171 to April 5, 2021 (85 FR\n70069). This extended the end of the first 18 months of applicability of 45 CFR part 171 until\nOctober 6, 2022 (85 FR 70069).\n\nBecause October 6, 2022, has passed, we proposed to revise the information blocking\ndefinition (§ 171.103) to remove the paragraph designating the period of time for which the\ninformation blocking definition was limited to EHI that consists of the data elements represented\nin the USCDI (88 FR 23864 and 88 FR 23916). This time period designation was codified in\n§ 171.103(b), as finalized in 2020, and removal of this paragraph allows for redesignation of\nremaining paragraphs within § 171.103 as shown in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (at 88 FR 23916).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, because we included the same date in two paragraphs of the Content and\nManner Exception (§ 171.301(a)(1) and (2)), we proposed to revise § 171.301 to remove the\nexisting § 171.301(a)(1) and (2) as no longer necessary (88 FR 23864 through 23865 and 88 FR\n23916). The proposed revised version of § 171.301 refers simply to EHI. We further proposed to\nrenumber several of the existing provisions in § 171.301 accordingly and rename the exception\nas the “Manner” exception.\n\n*Comments.* Comments received on our proposal to remove obsolete text from the\ninformation blocking definition (§ 171.103) generally supported this proposal. Comments noted\nthat the information blocking definition prevents practices that hinder access to EHI, supports\nimproved access to EHI for patients and health care providers, facilitates interoperability and\nencourages actors to prioritize interoperability, and promotes transparency and accountability in\nthe healthcare ecosystem. A commenter stated the information blocking regulations are\nbeneficial to underserved, underrepresented patient populations and the health care providers\nwho serve them. This commenter advocated for collaborative efforts among various parties\ninterested in information sharing, characterizing such efforts as crucial to ensuring that the\ninformation blocking regulations effectively support the goal of equitable access to high-quality\nhealthcare for underserved populations. No commenters opposed this proposal. However, some\ncommenters did note general concerns about the importance of balancing information sharing\ngoals with patient privacy and data security.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback and have finalized the update to the\ninformation blocking definition (§ 171.103), as proposed. The topic of balancing information\nsharing goals with patient privacy and security of patients’ health information is out of scope for\nthis proposal, but it was also raised in comments on other proposals. We discuss, at the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeginning of section IV of this final rule (above), comments raising general concerns about a\nperceived conflict between the goals of maximizing information sharing and appropriately\nprotecting patients’ privacy interests. We agree that information sharing can help improve many\naspects of health care for all patients throughout the United States. We look forward to continued\nengagement with actors, patients, and others who support information sharing that contributes to\nimproved care and health for individuals, families, and communities.\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment that expressed concern about requirements to\nshare mental health notes that were historically blocked from the rest of the record. The comment\nidentified as an issue having all health care providers being able to access all mental health notes\nwhen they may not be immediately relevant to the patient at the point of care.\n\n*Response.* In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we did not propose to modify existing exclusions\nfrom the § 171.102 definition of EHI for purposes of the information blocking regulations.\n\nPsychotherapy notes as defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.501 are explicitly\nexcluded from the 45 CFR 171.102 definition of electronic health information (EHI) for\npurposes of the information blocking regulations. We have posted on our website information\nresources to help actors understand the EHI definition and consider whether particular data is\nEHI for purposes of 45 CFR part 171 (see https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-blocking).\n\nWe note, and remind actors, that persons who engage in inappropriate uses and\ndisclosures of individuals’ health information may be violating other laws, including, but not\nlimited to, the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 42 CFR part 2, or state or tribal laws. Persons using or\ndisclosing individuals’ health information in violation of one or more such law(s) would be\nsubject to the consequences for violating those laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A commenter advocated for further revision of the information blocking\ndefinition to specify who must be affected by a practice that is otherwise consistent with the\ndefinition in order for the practice to be considered information blocking. The comment\nsuggested as an example adding to paragraph (2)(b) of § 171.103 an explicit statement that the\naction can affect EHI access by physicians as well as by patients.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose such a revision in § 171.103 and decline to adopt it here.\n\nWe reiterate that an actor’s practice meeting the information blocking definition is considered to\nbe information blocking regardless of whether it affects access, exchange, or use of EHI by a\npatient, health care provider, health plan, or other person (as defined in § 171.102) that seeks\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI for any permissible purpose (as defined in § 171.102).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested we retain “Content and Manner” as the title of the\nexception codified in § 171.301 and retain wording specific to limiting the content fulfilled for a\nrequest to recognize the potential for an actor to be able to fulfill access, exchange, or use of\nsome, but not all, EHI in a particular requested manner. Another commenter characterized our\nproposal to remove reference to the period of time and limited EHI in § 171.301 as removing a\nsafe harbor protection for limiting the content of a response. This commenter stated that an actor\nmay be able to satisfy § 171.301 for only some of the EHI requested. This commenter also stated\nthat the proposed revision to § 171.301 creates uncertainty as to whether the Manner Exception\ncan be satisfied where an actor can fulfill access, exchange, or use of only some EHI in the\nmanner requested or in an alternative manner consistent with § 171.301.\n\n*Response.* We decline to retain the prior title of the Manner Exception. We note that the\n“content” condition we have removed from regulatory text through this final rule has been moot\nsince October 6, 2022, and we did not propose to re-instate it in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. In\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsection IV.A, we discuss an example situation where multiple exceptions could be used to\nprovide an actor with certainty that their practices in responding to a request for access,\nexchange, or use of EHI will not be considered to be information blocking. Similarly, an actor\nmight be able to satisfy the Manner Exception for only some of the EHI requested in a particular\nsituation. In such instances, an actor may want to consider whether another exception is\napplicable to any other requested EHI.\n\nSummary of finalized policy: After consideration of comments, we have finalized the\nproposed removal of references to the USCDI, as well as the time period designation, from\n§§ 171.103 and 171.301. We have also finalized corresponding redesignations of paragraphs, as\nproposed.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We established the Infeasibility Exception in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR\n25865 through 25870, 85 FR 25958; 45 CFR 171.204). The Infeasibility Exception includes\nconditions under which an actor’s practice of not fulfilling requests for EHI access, exchange, or\nuse due to infeasibility will not be considered information blocking. One of the conditions of the\nInfeasibility Exception, finalized by the ONC Cures Act Final Rule in § 171.204(a)(1), is the\nuncontrollable events condition. Under the uncontrollable events condition, an actor's practice of\nnot fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI that is infeasible for the actor to fulfill as\na result of events beyond the actor’s control (listed in § 171.204(a)(1)) will not be considered\ninformation blocking provided such practice also meets the condition in § 171.204(b). In the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to revise § 171.204(a)(1) to add clarity to the uncontrollable\nevents condition (88 FR 23865).\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23865), we reminded readers that under the\nuncontrollable events condition, an actor’s practice of not fulfilling a request to access,\nexchange, or use EHI as a result of a natural or human-made disaster, public health emergency,\npublic safety incident, war, terrorist attack, civil insurrection, strike or other labor unrest,\ntelecommunication or internet service interruption, or act of military, civil or regulatory authority\n(§ 171.204(a)(1); 85 FR 25874) will not be considered information blocking provided such\npractice also meets the condition in § 171.204(b). We explained that the fact that an\nuncontrollable event specified in § 171.204(a)(1) occurred is not a sufficient basis alone for an\nactor to meet the uncontrollable events condition of the Infeasibility Exception. Rather, the use\nof the words “due to” in the uncontrollable events condition (paragraph (a)(1) of § 171.204) was\nintended to convey, consistent with the Cures Act Proposed Rule, that the actor must\ndemonstrate a causal connection between the actor’s inability to fulfill access, exchange, or use\nof EHI and the uncontrollable event. As we illustrated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR\n23865), a public health emergency is listed as an uncontrollable event under § 171.204(a)(1). If\nthe federal government or a state government were to declare a public health emergency, the\nmere fact of that declaration would not suffice for an actor to meet the condition. To meet the\ncondition, the actor would need to demonstrate that the public health emergency actually caused\nthe actor to be unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI for the facts and circumstances\nin question. The emergency need not be the only cause of a particular incapacity, but the actor\nneeds to demonstrate that the public health emergency did in fact negatively impact the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfeasibility of that actor fulfilling access, exchange, or use in the specific circumstances where the\nactor is claiming infeasibility.\n\nWhile the uncontrollable events condition (§ 171.204(a)(1)) has always required causal\nconnection between the actor’s inability to fulfill the request and the natural or human-made\ndisaster, public health emergency, public safety incident, war, terrorist attack, civil insurrection,\nstrike or other labor unrest, telecommunication or internet service interruption, or act of military,\ncivil or regulatory authority, we proposed to revise the condition by replacing the words “due to”\nwith “because of” (88 FR 23865). We welcomed comments on this proposal, including whether\nalternative or additional refinements to the wording of the condition may make the causal\nconnection requirement more immediately obvious from the face of the text in § 171.204(a)(1)\n(88 FR 23865).\n\n*Comments.* In general, commenters expressed support for clarifying the uncontrollable\nevents condition by stating that the actor’s inability to fulfill the request is “because of” one of\nthe events listed. Commenters noted that the extra clarity adds certainty for actors and\ndemonstrates a clear causation requirement. Some commenters supported the change but noted\nthat “due to” and “because of” mean the same thing and the change would not have any resulting\nimplications for actors. Another commenter agreed with the intent but did not believe that the\nchange of wording from “due to” to “because of” provides any more clarity. This commenter\nasked what change in impact or obligation stemmed from the change, recommending a clear\nstatement of the causal connection between the uncontrollable event and the impact on the actor.\n\nA commenter requested clarification as to how ONC believes the “due to” and “because of”\ndiffer in terms of implications for--or obligations now expected of-- actors. A commenter\nrecommended we make a clear statement about the causal connection between the uncontrollable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevent and the impact on the actor but did not suggest where, or in what words, we should\nconsider making the statement.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters and as discussed\nmore fully below; we have finalized a revision of § 171.204(a)(1) with modifications to the\nregulation text to provide additional clarity. As noted in the preamble to the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule, the words “due to” convey that the actor must demonstrate a causal connection between\nnot providing access, exchange, or use of EHI and the uncontrollable event (88 FR 23865). We\nproposed to change the term to “because of” to provide further clarity. The revised language was\nnot intended to change the substance of the condition, its implications, or what would be required\nof an actor for purposes of meeting the condition.\n\nWe did not receive comments suggesting specific additional refinements to the\ncondition’s text, or recommending specific alternative wording for “because of,” to make the\ncausal connection requirement more immediately obvious from the text of the uncontrollable\nevents condition (§ 171.204(a)(1)). However, having considered commenters’ feedback, adding\ntext to the finalized revision to § 171.204 will help actors and other interested persons\nimmediately recognize that a causal connection is required between the uncontrollable event and\nthe infeasibility of the actor’s fulfilling a request for EHI access, exchange, or use. We have,\ntherefore, finalized the proposed revision to § 171.204(a)(1) with the additional clause “that in\nfact negatively impacts the actor’s ability to fulfill the request” at the end of the condition. This\nadditional text is consistent with our statement in the preamble of the HTI-1 Proposed Rule that\n“the actor must demonstrate a causal connection between not providing access, exchange, or use\nof EHI and the uncontrollable event” (88 FR 23865). We intend for this additional clause to\nreinforce clarity that the actor must demonstrate an actual negative impact of the uncontrollable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevent on their ability to fulfill the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI for the\nuncontrollable events condition to be met. To reiterate, the finalized change to the wording of\n§ 171.204 is only intended to improve clarity for actors and other interested parties in\ncomparison to the previous wording rather than to make any change to the substance of the\npolicy that it codifies.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended that ONC expand the definitions within the\nuncontrollable events condition to include impediments of data access, exchange, or use because\nof any disaster or emergency declared by an authorized governmental entity, noting that in\naddition to declared emergencies, this would include response and recovery periods associated\nwith natural disasters that impacted the availability of providers' information systems or data.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose to change the list of uncontrollable events or further define\nthem, nor do we believe it is necessary to revise the references to disasters and emergencies to\nrefer to a governmental declaration of that status or recovery or restoration periods. The events\nlisted in the condition include acts of “military, civil, or regulatory authority” as well as natural\nor human-made disasters and other types of events or emergencies that might prompt a\ngovernmental authority to issue a declaration of disaster or emergency. However, consistent with\nthe scope of the proposal, we emphasize that a key component of this condition is that an actor\nmust demonstrate that a request for access, exchange, or use is infeasible because the\nuncontrollable event negatively impacts the actor’s ability to fulfill the request.\n\nComment. A commenter recommended that we consider reporting flexibilities for this\ncondition similar to those that other HHS programs put in place for declared emergencies, citing\nwaivers issued in the context of public health emergencies for requirements of programs\nadministered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We did not propose to create such a reporting system as suggested by the\ncommenter nor is there currently a requirement for actors to routinely report to ONC which of\ntheir practices they believe they have structured to satisfy any information blocking exception(s).\n\nWe thank the commenter for the suggestion.\n\nComment. A commenter noted the importance of minimizing administrative burden on\nhealth care providers, and specifically physicians delivering care in context of an emergency or\ndisaster.\n\n*Response.* The commenter did not specify the types of administrative burden it was\nconcerned about, but we suspect the concern is related to documenting compliance with the\nconditions of the Infeasibility Exception, including § 171.204(b). We emphasize that the\nuncontrollable events condition does not require specific documentation to be satisfied, and we\ndid not propose specific documentation requirements for an actor to satisfy the uncontrollable\nevents condition in paragraph (a)(2). We also did not propose to change the requirements of the\nresponding to requests condition (§ 171.204(b)). Both conditions remain the same in this regard.\n\nThe responding to requests condition (§ 171.204(b)) does not include specific documentation\nrequirements, but does require the actor to provide the requestor, in writing, the reason(s) why\nthe request is infeasible within ten business days of receipt of the request. An actor has flexibility\nin demonstrating how they met the uncontrollable events and the responding to requests\nconditions of the Infeasibility Exception.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter asked about an actor’s burden of proof with respect to this\nexception.\n\n*Response.* As noted in the response to the comment above, we did not propose in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule specific documentation requirements for an actor to satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuncontrollable events condition or the responding to requests condition of the Infeasibility\nException. In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25821), we stated that an actor seeking an\nexception needs to meet all relevant conditions of the exception at all relevant times. For the\nInfeasibility Exception, an actor seeking to satisfy the exception would need to demonstrate it\nsatisfied one of the conditions in § 171.204(a) and the condition in § 171.204(b). Further, as we\nnoted in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, the actor would need to produce evidence and ultimately\nprove that complying with the request for access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner\nrequested would have imposed a clearly unreasonable burden on the actor under the\ncircumstances (88 FR 23865, citing 85 FR 25866). We also refer readers to the ONC Cures Act\nFinal Rule (85 FR 25819) for additional discussion on establishing that an actor’s practice(s)\nmeet the conditions of an exception.\n\n*Comments.* Some comments we received discussed the responding to requests condition\n(§ 171.204(b)) as new or pending or in other ways that suggested some commenters may not\nhave reviewed the full text of the existing Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204) prior to\ncommenting on the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\n*Response.* We thank all commenters for their feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to\nremind actors, and any persons who may seek EHI access from actors, where and how to find all\nthe information blocking exceptions, and to discuss a bit further here the Infeasibility\nException’s structure and its requirements.\n\nFirst, we note that actors seeking to satisfy an exception, or other persons interested in\nwhen an exception applies, should review the exception’s full regulatory text (found in the\nexception’s section of 45 CFR part 171). In addition, the requirements and conditions of each\nexception set forth in subparts B, C, and D of 45 CFR part 171 should be read in context with the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubpart’s “availability and effect of exceptions” section (45 CFR 171.200, 45 CFR 171.300, and\n45 CFR 171.400, respectively), as well as the general provisions in subpart A of 45 CFR part\n171. The conditions under which each exception can be satisfied are specified in 45 CFR part\n171. Where the conditions include any requirements the actor’s practice must satisfy for an\nexception to apply, these requirements are included in that exception’s section of 45 CFR part\n171. For example, all of the conditions and requirements for the Infeasibility Exception to apply\nto an actor’s practice of not fulfilling requested EHI access, exchange, or use due to the\ninfeasibility of the request are specified in § 171.204. The general provisions in subpart A\nindicate the statutory basis and purpose of the information blocking regulations, the applicability\nof the regulations, and definitions of certain terms used in 45 CFR part 171.\n\nSpecific to the Infeasibility Exception, the requirement that, for this exception to apply,\nthe actor’s practice must satisfy at least one condition in paragraph (a) and also satisfy the\ncondition in paragraph (b) of § 171. 204 has been in place since the Infeasibility Exception\n(§ 171.204) was established in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25869 and 85 FR 25958;\nsee also 85 FR 25867). Thus, as is the case for a practice meeting any of the conditions codified\nin § 171.204(a), an actor's practice consistent with the § 171.204(a)(1) uncontrollable events\ncondition would also need to meet the requirements of § 171.204(b), the responding to requests\ncondition, for that practice to fully satisfy the Infeasibility Exception.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters suggested that 10 business days may not be enough time\nfor an actor severely impacted by a disaster to become aware of and respond to requests received\naround the time the disaster occurred, or that actors may need time to recover from an event\nbefore they are able to respond to requests for EHI. One of these commenters cited the potential\nfor some events to be sufficiently disruptive and that the actor would lose the ability to access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequests received before and during the disruption. The commenter noted that a 10-day response\ntime may be unreasonable in the middle of a major hurricane involving power outage, facilities\ndamage, and displacement of staff members key to processing requests. A comment suggested\nspecific changes to the responding to requests condition so that an automated notice a system is\ndown be considered as sufficient “notice” to satisfy the exception.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule to change any aspect of the\nresponding to requests condition (§ 171.204(b)) and decline to do so in this final rule. However,\nas it applies to actors’ practices of not fulfilling requests that are infeasible because an\nuncontrollable event has, in fact, negatively impacted the actor’s ability to fulfill access,\nexchange, or use of EHI, we welcome the opportunity to clarify that the responding to requests\ncondition (§ 171.204(b)) does not focus on when the requestor sends or attempts to make the\nrequest. Rather, the responding to requests condition (§ 171.204(b)) specifies the “receipt of the\nrequest.” Satisfying the responding to requests condition, therefore, requires providing the\nreason for infeasibility in writing within ten business days of the actor receiving the request\nrather than counting ten business days from when a requestor may have sent or attempted to send\nthe request.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter supported the Infeasibility Exception and asked that ONC\nconsider further examples and definitions of extreme and uncontrollable circumstances to\nprevent abuse of the condition.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support. We note that the finalized revision to\n§ 171.204(a)(1) includes the following additional clause at its end: “. . . that in fact negatively\nimpacts the actor’s ability to fulfill the request.” This new additional clause makes it clear that in\norder for the actor’s not fulfilling a request to satisfy the § 171.204(a)(1) uncontrollable events\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondition, the uncontrollable event must, in fact, have had an adverse impact on the actor’s\nability to fulfill a request for EHI access, exchange, or use. We believe the clarifying\nmodification will help prevent abuse of the condition because it will enable actors to more\nconfidently and accurately assess when and how the uncontrollable events condition could be\nsatisfied, thus deterring actors from asserting they cannot fulfill a request merely because an\nuncontrollable event that did not negatively impact the actor’s ability to fulfill the request had\noccurred.\n\nSummary of finalized policy – uncontrollable events condition of the Infeasibility\nException (§ 171.204(a)(1)): After consideration of comments received, we have finalized the\nrevised uncontrollable events condition to the Infeasibility Exception with modifications to the\nproposed regulatory text. We have finalized our proposal to replace “due to” with “because of”\nin § 171.204(a). As discussed in response to comments, we have also added to the end of the text\nof § 171.204(a) the following: “that in fact negatively impacts the actor’s ability to fulfill the\nrequest.” This addition is intended to improve the clarity with which the text conveys that to\nmeet this specific condition of the Infeasibility Exception with respect to any request, an actor\ncannot simply assert that they cannot fulfill a request because an event consistent with\n§ 171.204(a) occurred. To meet the condition, the actor must demonstrate that the uncontrollable\nevent, in fact, negatively impacted the actor’s inability to fulfill a request.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23865 through 23867), we proposed to renumber the\nInfeasibility Exception’s (45 CFR 171.204) infeasible under the circumstances condition from\nparagraph (a)(3) to paragraph (a)(5) and to codify at (a)(3) a new condition third party seeking\nmodification use. We proposed, as discussed in section IV.B.1.c below, another new condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat would be codified as paragraph (a)(4) of § 171.204. We received no comments expressing a\nparticular view on the redesignation of infeasible under the circumstances condition as\nsubparagraph (a)(5) and have, based on finalization of proposed new conditions in (a)(3) and\n(a)(4), finalized the redesignation of the infeasible under the circumstances condition as (a)(5).\n\nWe proposed that the § 171.204(a)(3) third party seeking modification use condition\nwould apply in certain situations where the actor is asked to provide the ability for a third party\n(or its technology, such as an application) to modify EHI that is maintained by or for an entity\nthat has deployed health information technology as defined in § 170.102 and maintains within or\nthrough use of that technology any instance(s) of any electronic health information as defined in\n§ 171.102. As a reminder, to fully satisfy the exception in § 171.204, an actor’s practice must\nmeet one of the conditions in paragraph (a) of § 171.204 and the requirements in paragraph (b) of\n§ 171.204 (“… the actor must, within ten business days of receipt of [a] request, provide to the\nrequestor in writing the reason(s) why the request is infeasible”).\n\nWe proposed (88 FR 23865 through 23867) that the third party seeking modification use\ncondition of the Infeasibility Exception would be limited to situations when “[t]he request is to\nenable use of EHI in order to modify EHI (including, but not limited to, creation and deletion\nfunctionality), provided the request is not from a health care provider requesting such use from\nan actor that is its business associate” (88 FR 23916, emphasis added).\n\nIn § 171.102, we define “use” for purposes of the information blocking definition to\nmean “the ability for electronic health information, once accessed or exchanged, to be\nunderstood and acted upon.” We stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule that “acted upon”\nwithin the final “use” definition “encompasses the ability to read, write, modify, manipulate, or\napply the information ….” (85 FR 25806). Therefore, in § 171.204(a)(3), we proposed to use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“third party seeking modification use” as a descriptive title for the new proposed condition of the\nInfeasibility Exception applicable to an actor’s denial of requests from a third party for\n“modification use” of EHI. In particular, this new condition focuses on requests to modify EHI\nheld by or for a health care provider and is not applicable to third-party requests for other\nactivities that would fall within the § 171.102 definition of the broader term “use.” For example,\nthe new third party seeking modification use condition would not apply to any request involving\nonly the ability to read or apply the information, which are other activities in the broader\ndefinition of use we used in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule. The third party seeking modification\nuse condition is also not applicable to any request for “access” or “exchange” (as these terms are\ndefined in § 171.102) of EHI.\n\nThe information blocking definition (§ 171.103) refers to the “access, exchange, or use”\nof electronic health information, and each of these terms is defined for purposes of 45 CFR part\n171 in § 171.102. In this portion of the preamble, as in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23865),\nwe use the term “modify” or “modification use” to describe the particular type of “use” covered\nby this new condition. We do so to avoid confusion between this “modification use” and the\ndefinition of the broader term use in § 171.102. It is important to note that the term “modification\nuse” in the proposed and finalized § 171.204(a)(3) refers to a specific type of use within the\n§ 171.102 definition of the term use.<sup>249</sup>\nModification use focuses on actions on the EHI that\nchange it in some way. Specifically, the condition focuses on requests to modify EHI held by or\nfor a health care provider, but not to other types of “use,” such as the ability for EHI to be\nunderstood by a third party. The third party seeking modification use condition does not\n\n\nFootnote 249:\nIn § 171.102, we define “use” for purposes of the information blocking definition to mean “the ability for\nelectronic health information, once accessed or exchanged, to be understood and acted upon.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimplicate, indicate, or imply any change to the definition of use in § 171.102 for any other\npurpose under 45 CFR part 171, or to any definition or other provision of the HIPAA Rules in 45\nCFR parts 160 and 164. We recognize that HIPAA covered entities and business associates have\nan obligation under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to only disclose or use, in the sense of “use” as\ndefined in 45 CFR 160.103, PHI as and when permitted or required under subpart E of 45 CFR\npart 164 or subpart C of 54 CFR part 1600 (see 45 CFR § 164.502(a)). We have structured the\ninformation blocking regulations, including this finalized revision to the Infeasibility Exception,\nto accommodate that obligation.<sup>250</sup>\nWe note that the third party seeking modification use\ncondition does not imply or indicate any change to the HIPAA Rules (see 88 FR 23865).\n\nWe proposed to add a definition of business associate to § 171.102 because we use the\nterm in the third party seeking modification use condition. We proposed that the definition of\nbusiness associate in § 171.102 would, by cross-reference to 45 CFR 160.103, be the same as the\nHIPAA Rules’ definition of “business associate.” We emphasize that the § 171.204(a)(3) third\nparty seeking modification use condition does not operate to change a business associate’s rights\nor responsibilities under their business associate agreement (BAA) with any HIPAA covered\nentity. We also reiterate that the information blocking regulations do not require actors to violate\nBAAs or associated service level agreements. However, as we also previously explained in the\nONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25812) and in information blocking FAQ28 (available at\nHealthIT.gov <sup>251</sup>\n), terms or provisions of BAAs could constitute an interference (and thus could\n\n\nFootnote 250:\nWe discuss information blocking regulations’ accommodation of HIPAA and other privacy laws in section 4.A,\ngeneral comments.\n\n\nFootnote 251:\nIB.FAQ28.2.2021APR: “Do the information blocking regulations require actors to violate existing business\nassociate agreements in order to not be considered information blockers?” (Available at\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/faq/do-information-blocking-regulations-require-actors-violate-existing-business-associate.\n\nRetrieved Sep 14, 2023.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe information blocking) if used in a discriminatory manner by an actor to forbid or limit access,\nexchange, or use of EHI that otherwise would be a permitted disclosure under the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule. To determine whether there is information blocking, the actions and processes\n(e.g., negotiations) of the actors in reaching the BAA and associated service level agreements\nwould likely need to be reviewed to determine whether there was any action taken by an actor\nthat was likely to interfere with (“prevent, materially discourage, or otherwise inhibit”;\n§ 171.102) the access, exchange, or use of EHI, and whether the actor had the requisite intent (85\nFR 25812).\n\n*Comments.* Comments received on the proposed § 171.204(a)(3) third party seeking\nmodification use condition were generally supportive. Comments supporting this proposal\ncommended the proposal’s alignment with the policy goals expressed in the HTI-1 Proposed\nRule, including reducing the burden on actors to document each modification use request in the\nsame way that an actor would need to document its actions for the infeasible under the\ncircumstances condition of the Infeasibility Exception. Some commenters supportive of this\nproposal also expressed appreciation for the proposal’s applicability to situations where an actor\nmay be concerned about the accuracy or reliability of data that a third party would like to add to\nan individual’s designated record set maintained by the actor. A few commenters also noted that\nthe proposed condition would simplify the handling of certain requests for EHI. A few\ncommenters expressed support for the proposal’s exclusion of requests that come from health\ncare providers to their business associates.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters. We have finalized\nthe § 171.204(a)(3) third party seeking modification use condition with the minor modification\nof deleting the parenthetical “(including but not limited to creation and deletion functionality)”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom the regulatory text in § 171.204(a)(3). This is done solely for readability purposes. The\nrequests covered by this condition, as finalized, are to enable a third party EHI modification use\nfunctionality, including, but not limited to, creation and deletion functionality.\n\n*Comments.* A few of the commenters did not support the proposal. Some of these\ncommenters expressed concern that the proposal could potentially inhibit care coordination by\nmaking it too easy for an actor holding EHI to simply refuse modification use requests from third\nparties who also furnish services to the same patient(s). Some of these commenters expressed\nconcern that certain actors, such as health IT developers of certified health IT, may seek to\nmisuse the proposal to restrict access to EHI in an overly broad manner.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for bringing to our attention their concerns about\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI in support of care coordination. In developing our discrete\nproposal to provide further certainty to actors and now in finalizing this proposal, we have\nconsidered these concerns. In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule discussion of the reasons why this\ncondition is not available to an actor when the actor is a business associate of a health care\nprovider who is making the modification use request, we noted that there is often a level of trust\nand contractual protections between covered entities and business associates that removes certain\nconcerns, such as security and data provenance, that led us to propose this new condition as\nstructured (88 FR 23866). Many of these matters are addressed in business associate agreements,\nincluding security, as well as the permitted uses of the EHI (ePHI) that the covered entity grants\nthe business associate. Further, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules place certain obligations\non covered entities and their business associates that protect the privacy and security of EHI (and\nother PHI). For these reasons, we finalized this condition, as proposed, which permits actors to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeny requests to modify EHI provided the request is not from a health care provider for which\nthe actor is the business associate.\n\nThis condition was not proposed to apply, and as finalized does not apply, to an actor’s\npractice of refusing to receive or process EHI via health information exchange or refusing to\nmake EHI available for access, exchange, or use for permissible purposes. Where the manner or\nmeans of EHI use sought by a third party would not involve enabling a third party to modify\n(such as by adding to, creating, overwriting, editing, or deleting) EHI, then the condition does\nnot apply even if the request is from someone other than a health care provider to whom the actor\nis a business associate. We also clarify that the third party seeking modification use condition\napplies only where a third party seeks modification use functionality for EHI within the records\nor systems maintained by the actor. This condition cannot be satisfied where a third party seeks\naccess or exchange of EHI, even if the actor is certain that the requestor will or may make\n“modification use” of the EHI once it (or a copy of it) is in the requestor’s possession, custody,\nor control. For example, the condition does not apply to situations where a health care provider,\nor their health IT developer chooses not to accept and process (such as through an EHR’s receive\nand incorporate functions) EHI from a patient’s health plan or prior health care provider or\nanother of the patient’s current health care providers. The condition also does not apply to read-\nonly access (such as through API technology certified to any of the criteria in § 170.315(g)(7)\nthrough (10)), or to an actor’s practice of refusing to make a patient’s EHI available for access,\nexchange, or use by care coordination partners for permissible purposes. “Permissible purposes”\nis defined for purposes of the information blocking regulations in § 171.102.\n\nRegarding commenters’ concerns about entities potentially abusing the third party\nseeking modification use condition to restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI, the limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncircumstances for which this condition applies, as described above and below, will mitigate any\npotential for abuse. This condition does not pose a problem for care coordination because it is\nvery narrowly focused only on a particular manner of modification use of EHI (88 FR 23866)\nthat the health care provider or the business associate would not have to enable, and it does not\napply to a wide variety of manners by which health care providers routinely access, exchange,\nand use EHI for care coordination purposes. However, any abuse of this condition or any\ncomponent of the information blocking regulations would be of concern to ONC, and we\nencourage anyone who believes they may have experienced or observed information blocking by\nany health care provider, health IT developer of certified health IT, or health information\nnetwork or health information exchange to share their concerns with us through the Information\nBlocking Portal<sup>252</sup>\non ONC’s website, HealthIT.gov.<sup>253</sup>\nInformation received by ONC through\nthe Information Blocking Portal as well as the Health IT Feedback and Inquiry Portal<sup>254</sup>\nalso\nhelps inform the development of resources we make publicly available on ONC’s website,\nHealthIT.gov.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested that ONC provide further guidance on specific\nuse cases where the third party seeking modification use condition could apply, including\nmaterials such as FAQs, scenario-based guidance, and examples of documenting use of the\ncondition, including for behavioral health providers. One commenter recommended that\ndocumentation requirements for the condition be minimal.\n\n\nFootnote 252:\nURL https://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/6 (URL confirmed current and operational as\nof Sep 14, 2023).\n\n\nFootnote 253:\nURL to Information Blocking topic section of HealthIT.gov: https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-\nblocking.

We release educational resources on\nan ongoing basis. ONC-published resources can be found on HealthIT.gov and to date include\nfor the HTI-1 rulemaking: recorded webinars (both general and tailored for particular topics and\naudiences), fact sheets, measurement spec sheets, blog posts, and a new website hub for links to\nvarious materials and educational resources. In addition to the examples we provided in the HTI-\n1 Proposed Rule and provide in this final rule describing the applicability of this condition, we\nwill continue to provide resources such as infographics, fact sheets, webinars, and other forms of\neducational materials and outreach. Resources specific to the information blocking regulations in\n45 CFR part 171, across this and other ONC rules, are available on HealthIT.gov. The short URL\nthat redirects to the information blocking landing page is: healthit.gov/informationblocking.\n\nRegarding documentation requirements, we have not proposed or finalized a specific\ndocumentation requirement for the third party seeking modification use condition. In general,\nactors have flexibility to determine what documentation to create or keep in the event that they\nseek to claim an exception. However, as also discussed under the uncontrollable events condition\nabove, an actor would need to demonstrate for each practice for which the Infeasibility\nException is sought on the basis of the third party seeking modification use condition\n(§ 171.204(a)(3)) that the condition was met at all relevant times and that the condition in\n§ 171.204(b) was also met.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that the exceptions in subparts B and C of 45 CFR 171\nare too complex for small health care providers, do not provide additional clarity, and that ONC\nshould provide separate, simplified exceptions for health care providers.\n\n*Response.* As we noted in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, (85 FR 25819), we tailor\ninformation blocking exceptions and provide significant detail within each exception to clearly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexplain what an actor must do to meet each exception. For each exception, we typically propose\nand finalize conditions that can be consistently applied across all actors. However, there are\nconditions within certain exceptions that apply to one or a subset of actors, as applicable (85 FR\n25819). As we stated in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, the clearest and most equitable approach\nto the exceptions is to make all of the exceptions apply to all actors (85 FR 25819). Therefore,\nwe decline the commenter’s recommendation to provide “separate, simplified exceptions for\nhealth care providers.”\n\nWe believe that our explanations of the exceptions, as included in the ONC Cures Act\nrulemaking and in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and this final rule provide the necessary clarity for\nhealth care providers, including small health care providers, to understand and apply the\nexceptions. As discussed throughout this final rule, we also invest in educational outreach to\ninterested parties, including small health care providers and associations that represent them, in\nan effort to further explain the exceptions through presentations and written resources such as\nfact sheets.\n\nWe also note that the exceptions are voluntary and offer an actor certainty that a practice\nthat satisfies all of the relevant conditions of an exception will not be considered information\nblocking. Further, we reiterate that failure to meet an exception does not necessarily mean a\npractice meets the definition of information blocking. By satisfying an exception, an actor gains\nthe assurance that the actor’s practice does not constitute information blocking. An actor’s\npractice that does not meet the conditions of an exception does not automatically constitute\ninformation blocking, as the practice must still meet all the elements of the information blocking\ndefinition to be considered information blocking, including that the practice is likely to interfere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the access, exchange, or use of EHI, and that the actor acted with the requisite intent (85 FR\n25820).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters responded to our request for comment on whether the\ncondition should be of limited duration, and specifically, whether we should consider proposing\nto eliminate the condition if, at some point in the future, health information technology is capable\nof supporting lawful third-party modification use of EHI by any party with no or minimal\ninfeasibility or other concerns. The majority of comments on this subject stated either that the\nproposal should not have a sunset date, or that it would be premature to establish a sunset date at\nthis time. Two commenters stated that the condition should or could be eliminated in the future if\nthe future technology is capable of supporting the aforementioned modification use of EHI, with\nno or minimal infeasibility or other concerns.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. We agree that it would be\npremature to establish a sunset date for the condition because the appropriateness of eliminating\nthe condition depends on the continued development of health IT’s capability to support lawful\nthird-party modification use of EHI by any party and with no or minimal infeasibility or other\nconcerns. Because the pace of that continued health IT development is difficult to predict, we are\nnot establishing a sunset date for § 171.204(a)(3) at this time. If advances in health IT\ncapabilities or other changes in the interoperability and information sharing environment indicate\nto us that this condition should be modified or sunset, we would anticipate proposing such a\nchange in a future rulemaking.\n\n*Comments.* Three commenters expressed a concern that, as written, the condition would\nnot apply to requests to “exchange” EHI by adding new EHI to a system through exchange from\na third party. The commenters stated that ONC should add “exchange” of EHI to the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. The third party seeking\nmodification use condition of the Infeasibility Exception is available to most actors to address\nsituations where a third party’s request is to modify EHI stored or maintained by an actor (88 FR\n23866). The condition focuses on requests for a third party to have functionality to make\nmodification use of EHI while, and as, it is held in the records or systems of the actor. We did\nnot propose the condition to apply, and it cannot be met, where a third party is seeking to\nexchange EHI with the actor or to access a copy of EHI, even if the actor may know or\nreasonably suspect that the third party may modify (or have modified) EHI that is in records,\napplications, or systems maintained by the third party.\n\nIn situations where an actor receives EHI via exchange from a third party, whether that\nEHI is reconciled and incorporated into the record (“added” to the record) is a determination for\nthe health care provider and potentially its business associates. Any such exchange of EHI and\nsubsequent determinations to reconcile and incorporate EHI into the record (or not) is not within\nthe scope of the proposed condition. Such practices and scenarios may implicate the information\nblocking definition , but there may also be other conditions or exception that apply depending on\nthe specific facts and circumstances.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters stated that the limitation to this condition is not broad enough,\nand that ONC should expand the limitation of this condition to also apply when the actor’s\ncustomers are not HIPAA covered entities, or are not health care providers, but are maintaining\nEHI in systems licensed by an actor. Two commenters stated that the § 171.204(a)(3) third party\nseeking modification use condition should not apply in circumstances where the actor is a\nbusiness associate or contractor of the organization that has licensed the interoperability elements\nor systems responsible for maintaining EHI. Along these lines, two other commenters expressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\na concern that an actor, such as a health IT developer of certified health IT, that maintains EHI\non behalf of an HIN/HIE could use this condition to deny an HIN/HIE’s request, using third-\nparty technology, for modification use of EHI maintained by the HIN/HIE. The commenters\nsuggested that ONC clarify that the condition does not apply where a HIN/HIE requested\nmodification use of EHI held by a health care provider or their health IT developer.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. We finalized the limitation to\nthis condition to apply when the actor is a business associate of a health care provider making the\nmodification use request, and we are not at this time expanding the limitation of the condition as\nsome commenters suggested. As we noted in proposing this condition, there is often a level of\ntrust and contractual protections between covered entities and business associates that removes\ncertain concerns, such as security and data provenance, that led us to propose this new condition\n(88 FR 23866). We explained in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule discussion of the limitation of this\ncondition that covered entities (health care providers) and their business associates (as permitted\nby their BAA) need to access and modify relevant EHI held by other business associates of those\ncovered entities on a regular basis (88 FR 23866). Because our proposal focused on the\nobligations that the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules place on covered entities and their\nbusiness associates to protect the privacy and security of EHI (and other PHI), we decline to\nexpand the limitation of the condition at this time.\n\nRegarding the commenters’ concern about the application of the condition, we note that if\nthe request for modification use is from the health care provider requesting such use from an\nactor that is the health care provider’s business associate, the condition would not apply. Even if\nthe actor who is a business associate of a health care provider could provide, or currently\nprovides, items or services or engages in activities similar or identical to those the health care\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprovider wants the third party to have modification use of EHI to accomplish, the condition does\nnot apply when the actor is the business associate of the health care provider requesting\nmodification use of EHI. Likewise, the finalized condition does not apply to an actor’s denial of\nthird party modification use where the actor is a subcontractor of any business associate to a\nhealth care provider, and the health care provider requests such use of EHI maintained by or on\nbehalf of the health care provider. A “business associate” is a person or entity, other than a\nmember of the workforce of a covered entity, who performs functions or activities on behalf of,\nor provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve access by the business associate to\nPHI (§ 171.102). A “business associate” is also a subcontractor that creates, receives, maintains,\nor transmits PHI on behalf of another business associate.\n\nFor purposes of the provision “carving out” requests from a health care provider to an\nactor that is its business associate from application of § 171.204(a)(3), it does not matter whether\nthe health care provider merely licenses or otherwise obtains from the actor use of\ninteroperability elements that would be necessary to enable third party modification use of EHI\nthat the health care provider maintains, or the health care provider contracts with the actor to\nmaintain and manage on the health care provider’s behalf. If the actor is a business associate of\nthe health care provider and the provider requests modification use by a third party of EHI, then\nthe condition does not apply to the actor’s denial of that request. <sup>255</sup>\nFor these reasons, and in consideration of these and all comments received on our\ndiscrete proposal, we finalized, as proposed, a condition that permits actors to deny requests to\n\n\nFootnote 255:\nWhether other conditions in § 171.204(a) or another exception codified in subpart B or C of 45 CFR part 171\ncould be or have been satisfied in a particular situation would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the\ncase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodify EHI provided the request is not from a health care provider for which it is the business\nassociate. We have not at this time expanded the limitation to the condition as the commenters\nrequested. However, we note that we may consider amending the third party seeking\nmodification use condition or taking other appropriate steps in future rulemaking in response to\nchanging market conditions, experience with the condition in practice, or other signals that\nsuggest amending the condition may be appropriate.<sup>256</sup>\nAs a reminder, the third party seeking modification use condition does not operate to\nchange an actor’s contractual obligations to their customers. When an actor engages in a practice\nto deny modification use of EHI under the third party seeking modification use condition, they\nmay also wish to consider whether the practice violates any of their existing contractual\nobligations.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters raised issues that are out of scope for this proposal,\nincluding:\n• asking ONC to reiterate that actors cannot claim this exception to prevent requests from\nan individual or their personal representatives to amend the individual’s PHI or record as\npermitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule;\n• a request for ONC to study what entities have access to health care providers’ EHRs, why\nthose entities may request to access or change authenticated documents or clinical notes,\nhow health care providers evaluate the accuracy of data a third party wants to add to an\nindividual’s EHI, the potential benefits and harms of incorporating such data, and\n\n\nFootnote 256:\nPatterns described to us in claims or suggestions of possible information blocking submitted through the Report\nInformation Blocking Portal illustrate just one example of such signals coming to our attention. (The Report\nInformation Blocking Portal’s URL as of Jul 28, 2023, is:\nhttps://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhether this condition would be possible in a future environment in which the Trusted\nExchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) is actively exchanging data;\n• asking ONC to consider whether patients should be consulted before data from another\nhealth care provider is incorporated into their EHI;\n• asking ONC to consider what annotation mechanisms are or should be in place to create\nan audit trail for modifications to EHI;\n• asking ONC to establish incentives for third-party applications to utilize best practices\nregarding maintaining the integrity and security of electronic health information;\n• a request that the ten-business day timeline established in § 171.204(b) should be revised\nto be longer;\n• a request to include in the certification criteria for health IT the functionality to alert an\nactor when a third party seeks modifications to EHI in the actor’s system(s);\n• recommending that ONC update certification criteria to better support health care\nproviders’ ability to use third-party apps maintained in certified health IT, utilizing\nexisting APIs and support for user-created fields, while minimizing risks to data security\nand EHR performance;\n• requesting examples of how providers should store information from a third party\nseparate from the medical record, and requesting ONC work with health IT developers to\nimplement a mechanism for providers to maintain data that has not been integrated into\nthe medical record.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and reiterate our continued commitment\nto supporting EHI sharing consistent with patient preferences and applicable law. Whether\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreceived as out-of-scope comments on a proposed rule or through informal channels, the\nfeedback, and questions we receive, are appreciated and help to inform our development of\ninformation resources that we make publicly available on HealthIT.gov. Informal channels\ninclude, for example, the Health IT Feedback and Inquiry Portal<sup>257</sup>\nthat is available year-round\nand not tied to the comment period for a proposed rule.\n\nRegarding the relationship between the finalized § 171.204(a)(3) third party seeking\nmodification use condition and the HIPAA Rules, we note again, as we did in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, that the third party seeking modification use condition does not imply or indicate\nany change to the HIPAA Rules (see 88 FR 23865). Actors should note and should operate with\nawareness that a practice satisfying any information blocking exception in 45 CFR part 171\nsimply means that practice is not considered to be “information blocking” as defined in\n§ 171.103. Any actor (as defined in 45 CFR 171.102) that is also subject to any provision(s) in\n45 CFR parts 160, 162, or 164 must continue to comply with such provision(s) when and to the\nextent such provisions of the HIPAA Rules are applicable to the actor’s conduct.\n\nSummary of finalized policy: third party seeking modification use condition\nAs noted above and for the reasons stated above and in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we\nhave finalized the condition as proposed with a non-substantive edit to simplify the regulation\ntext by removing the parenthetical “(including, but not limited to, creation and deletion\nfunctionality).”\n\nWe note that for purposes of this condition, an actor may choose to verify that the\nmodification use request came from the health care provider themselves or accept the third\n\n\nFootnote 257:\nURL https://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2 (URL confirmed current and operational as\nof Sep 14, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparty’s representation of a request as coming from a health care provider. Any actor considering\nwhether to potentially avail themselves of the certainty offered by this exception will have\nflexibility to structure their communications approaches and operating procedures for\ncommunicating with the health care provider of which the actor is a business associate, or with\nthird parties representing themselves as business associates of such health care provider. This\nflexibility enables actors to operate and communicate efficiently while complying with the\nactor’s obligations under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, other applicable law, and its binding\nagreements (including its BAAs) with the health care providers who choose to request third party\nmodification use functionality either directly from the actor or through one of the health care\nprovider’s business associates. As discussed above under comments on documentation, an actor\nwould need to demonstrate for each practice for which the Infeasibility Exception is sought on\nthe basis of the third party seeking modification use condition (§ 171.204(a)(3)), that it met the\nthird party seeking modification condition and also met the § 171.204(b) responding to requests\ncondition at all relevant times.\n\nAs with every other condition in § 171.204(a), we note that the § 171.204(a)(3) third\nparty modification use condition stands alone. This means an actor’s practice could meet it\nwithout needing to meet any other § 171.204(a) condition. It also means an actor’s practice that\nfails to meet the § 171.204(a)(3) third party modification use condition could nevertheless satisfy\nanother of the conditions, such as the infeasible under the circumstances condition in\n§ 171.204(a)(5).\n\nWe emphasize that other conditions within § 171.204(a) and all of the other exceptions\nwould remain available for consideration by the actor as to their applicability to the situation and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest where the finalized § 171.204(a)(3) third party seeking modification use condition of the\nInfeasibility Exception would not be available.\n\n\n",

                  "title": "c. Infeasibility Exception – Manner Exception Exhausted",
                  "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to renumber the Infeasibility Exception's (45\nCFR 171.204) “infeasible under the circumstances” condition from paragraph (a)(3) to\nparagraph (a)(5) and to codify at (a)(4) a new “manner exception exhausted” condition (88 FR\n23867). We stated that the proposed manner exception exhausted condition would apply where\nan actor is still unable to fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI after having\nexhausted the exception in § 171.301 (which we have in this rule renamed Manner Exception,\nsee Section IV.A.1), including offering all alternative manners in accordance with § 171.301(b),\nso long as the actor does not currently provide to a substantial number of individuals or entities\nsimilarly situated to the requestor the same requested access, exchange, or use of the requested\nEHI (88 FR 23867).\n\nIn the ONC Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642), we finalized the Infeasibility Exception\nwith modifications from the proposal (84 FR 7542 and 7603) to address concerns raised by\ncommenters (see 85 FR 25866 through 25870). We finalized (85 FR 25858) three conditions that\nmore specifically address situations where the Infeasibility Exception would be appropriately\nused. One of the conditions we finalized, infeasible under the circumstances, requires the actor\nto demonstrate, through a contemporaneous written record or other documentation, its\nconsideration, in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner, of certain factors that led to its\ndetermination that complying with the request would be infeasible under the circumstances. The\nInfeasibility Exception (§ 171.204), as finalized in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, provides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassurance to an actor that if it meets applicable conditions of the exception at all relevant times,\nits practice will not be considered information blocking.\n\nAlso, in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized the “Content and Manner\nException” (now the Manner Exception) (45 CFR 171.301). Under § 171.301, for the Manner\nException to apply, an actor must fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI in any\nmanner requested, unless the actor is technically unable to fulfill the request or cannot reach\nagreeable terms with the requestor to fulfill the request (45 CFR 171.301(b)(1)(i), as originally\ncodified). If an actor and requestor reach agreeable terms and the actor fulfills a request\ndescribed in the manner condition in any manner requested: (1) Any fees charged by the actor in\nrelation to its response are not required to satisfy the Fees Exception in § 171.302; and (2) any\nlicense of interoperability elements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the request is not\nrequired to satisfy the Licensing Exception in § 171.303 (45 CFR 171.301(b)(1)(ii), as originally\ncodified) (85 FR 25877).\n\nSection 171.301(b)(2) (original codification, redesignated in this final rule as\n§ 171.301(b)) provides for fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in a manner other\nthan the manner requested. If an actor does not fulfill a request in any manner requested because\nit is technically unable to fulfill the request or cannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor to\nfulfill the request, the actor must fulfill the request in an alternative manner agreed upon with the\nrequestor consistent with § 171.301(b)(2) (original codification, now redesignated § 171.301(b))\nin order to satisfy the exception (85 FR 25877). The Manner Exception offers certainty that an\nactor's practices that fully satisfy the Manner Exception's conditions will not be considered\ninformation blocking and is meant to incentivize offering an alternative manner (with priority to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninteroperable manners based on HHS-adopted and available open standards) when the actor is\nunable to fulfill access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI in the manner initially requested.\n\nAs discussed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, actors expressed uncertainty to ONC as to\nwhether they have satisfied the infeasible under the circumstances condition in instances where\nthey contended that fulfilling a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI would be infeasible\n(85 FR 23867). Under the Infeasibility Exception, the infeasible under the circumstances\ncondition requires the actor to demonstrate that complying with the request is infeasible when\nconsidering, among other things, the financial and technical resources available to the actor and\nwhy the actor was unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI consistent with the Manner\nException. Specifically, actors have expressed concern about circumstances where the actor's\ninability to satisfy the Manner Exception's conditions rests solely on the requestor refusing to\naccept access, exchange, or use in any manner consistent with § 171.301, and fulfilling the\nrequest in the manner requested would require substantial technical or financial resources (or\nboth) in the view of the actor, including significant opportunity costs. We have observed this\nbeing more of a concern for actors with significant skills and other resources for developing\nunique technical solutions or new technological capabilities (e.g., EHR developers or HIN/HIEs)\nthan for actors with few to no such resources (e.g., small clinician office practices or safety net\nclinics), because, as noted, the infeasible under the circumstances condition of the Infeasibility\nException (§ 171.204(a)(5); previously § 171.204(a)(3)) requires actors to demonstrate their\nconsideration of the financial and technical resources available to them, as well as why the actor\nwas unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI consistent with § 171.301.\n\nAmong those actors with substantial skills and other resources to develop new, unique or\nunusual manners of supporting access, exchange, or use of EHI, we see actors who appear to be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiencing a problematic level of uncertainty about whether they will be engaging in\ninformation blocking if they decline demands from requestors for non-standard or non-scalable\nsolutions that they do not currently support even after they have offered to provide access,\nexchange, or use of EHI in the same manner(s) the actor makes generally available to its\ncustomers or affiliates, and through standards-based manners, consistent with § 171.301 –\nincluding offering terms for such manners that are consistent with the Fees (§ 171.302) and\nLicensing (§ 171.303) Exceptions. We anticipate that this uncertainty will lead actors who, again,\nhave already exhausted the Manner Exception (§ 171.301), to divert their development capacity\nto fulfilling requested manners of access, exchange, or use of EHI that they could invent to meet\nthe demands of a requestor determined to accept only the original manner they specified and who\nare unwilling or unable to agree to terms consistent with the Fees (§ 171.302) and Licensing\n(§ 171.303) Exceptions for their requested manner or any alternative manner consistent with the\nManner Exception (§ 171.301) (88 FR 23868).\n\nWe stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23868) that this new condition is necessary\nto ensure actors reasonably allocate resources toward interoperable, standards-based manners\nrather than allowing requestors, who, for whatever reason, do not build their products for\ncompatibility with open consensus standards or other industry standards to attempt to force use\nof non-standard or non-scalable solutions by simply refusing to accept access, exchange, or use\nof EHI in any other manner. This diversion of resources away from standards-based and scalable\nmanners of exchange detracts from, instead of supporting, achievement of key policy goals such\nas increased interoperability and innovation in use of open consensus standards to achieve\nsecure, seamless exchange. Where novel approaches to system interfaces or other aspects of\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI represent improvements over other available approaches, we\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanticipate these approaches will not need to be forced upon the industry but will instead find a\nnatural foothold and diffuse according to a normal innovation curve.\n\nTherefore, to reduce confusion and provide more certainty to actors, we proposed and\nhave finalized at § 171.204(a)(4) a new condition in the Infeasibility Exception, the manner\nexception exhausted condition. Actors will be able to satisfy this exception when they have\n“exhausted” the manner requested condition and alternative manner condition of the Manner\nException and meet the other requirements of the new condition. If an actor either technically\ncannot provide the access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner requested, or the actor and\nrequestor cannot reach agreeable terms on the manner requested, then the actor must attempt to\nfulfill the request using the alternative manners in § 171.301(b) (85 FR 25877) (previously\n§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)). Under the Manner Exception, for any alternative manner, the requestor must\neither specify the manner they would accept (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B)) or specifically agree\nwith the machine-readable format that they would accept (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(C)). In situations\nwhere an actor offers the alternative manners and the requestor does not specify or agree to\nreceive the EHI via the offered alternative manners (as may be the case if the requestor does not\nwant to receive the EHI in such a manner or cannot receive the EHI in such a manner), an actor\nmay now seek to satisfy the new finalized manner exception exhausted condition of the\nInfeasibility Exception.\n\nPreviously, an actor who offered all the alternative manners would likely look to the\ninfeasible under the circumstances condition of the Infeasibility Exception, which requires actors\nto demonstrate that complying with the request is infeasible when considering many factors,\nincluding the cost to the actor of complying with the request in the manner requested and the\nfinancial and technical resources available to the actor. The newly finalized manner exception\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexhausted provides actors the option of satisfying the Infeasibility Exception without needing to\nassess whether they could meet the requestor's particularized demands regarding the manner\nand/or terms in which they want to obtain access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters were supportive of ONC’s proposal to add the manner\nexception exhausted condition to the Infeasibility Exception. Commenters stated that it would\nreduce burden and allow actors to focus on innovation. Many commenters appreciated that the\ncondition encourages use of standards-based mechanisms, and that it removes the uncertainty\nthat could come about if it is technically infeasible for an actor to fulfill a request or when the\nactor has offered the alternative manners, but the requestor has not specified or agreed, as\napplicable, to access, exchange, or use of the EHI in any of those manners. Many commenters\nalso appreciated ONC’s acknowledgment that interoperable, standards-based exchange should be\nfavored over expensive, resource-intensive, one-off solutions. Other commenters expressed\nappreciation that the condition allows health IT developers of certified health IT and other actors\nthe opportunity to reach agreement on market-based terms and pricing to protect investments,\nwhile still promoting interoperability. A few commenters also expressed appreciation that the\ncondition can be met without the actor needing to demonstrate they considered the resources\navailable to the actor, and that exchanging entities will be protected from costly technical\nchanges or solutions made solely to avoid claims of information blocking.\n\nAlternately, a few commenters expressed general disagreement with the proposed\ncondition. One commenter expressed concerns that the condition could be interpreted to allow\nactors to remain in exchange patterns that do not expand interoperability across a range of\nrequestors and use cases. Another commenter noted that atypical requests may be necessary to\nachieve a particular use of EHI that is not adequately supported by existing standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their thoughtful feedback. Upon consideration of all\ncomments received related to this proposal, we have finalized the condition as proposed with two\nmodifications discussed below. We agree that the manner exception exhausted condition\nprioritizes interoperability and encourages efficiency by applying the Infeasibility Exception\nunder circumstances where the actor cannot meet, or cannot be certain that they have met, the\ninfeasible under the circumstances condition. We recognize that custom, one-off solutions can be\ncostly and inhibit investment in innovative, scalable approaches to interoperability and exchange.\n\nWe also recognize that atypical requests may be necessary to achieve a particular use of EHI and\nnote that nothing in the information blocking regulations would prevent a requestor and actor\nfrom coming to an agreement to achieve innovative solutions to interoperability challenges or\natypical use cases. To this point, we previously established the manner requested condition of\nthe Manner Exception, now codified in § 171.301(a), which permits actors and requestors to\ncome to terms on access, exchange, and use of EHI without such terms necessarily satisfying the\n§ 171.302 Fees Exception or § 171.303 Licensing Exception.\n\nIn response to concerns that this may allow actors to remain in exchange patterns that do\nnot expand interoperability, we note that satisfying the finalized manner exception exhausted\ncondition of the Infeasibility Exception requires the actor to offer a standards-based method of\nexchange, either through certified health IT or using technology and transport standards\npublished by the federal government or a standards developing organization accredited by the\nAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI). Both methods would support interoperability,\nand the use of certified health IT incrementally expands interoperability through certification to\nnew and revised certification criteria that include new and updated standards and capabilities.\n\nHow many alternative manners are required to satisfy the condition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we stated that it is important that the Manner Exception not\nbe considered exhausted if the actor offers only one alternative manner, or only the least-\ninteroperable “alternative machine-readable format” now codified in § 171.301(b)(1)(iii) (88 FR\n23869). Therefore, we proposed a second factor requiring actors to have offered all three\nalternative manners in accordance with § 171.301(b) (88 FR 23869). We requested comments on\nhow many of the alternative manners an actor should be required to offer in order to satisfy the\nproposed manner exception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception: one, two, or all\nthree alternative manners.\n\nAs explained below, we have finalized the manner exception exhausted condition of the\nInfeasibility Exception with a requirement that an actor offer two alternative manners, at least\none of which must be either the alternative manner in § 171.301(b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii). These\nalternative manners are, respectively, “[u]sing technology certified to standard(s) adopted in part\n170 that is specified by the requestor” (in other words, via health IT certified under the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program, 45 CFR part 170) or, “[u]sing content and transport standards\nspecified by the requestor and published by: (A) the Federal Government; or (B) a standards\ndevelopment organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute” (45 CFR\n171.301(b)(1)). An actor may offer both of these alternative manners to satisfy this particular\nfactor of the manner exception exhausted condition, or only one of these two and the manner\nspecified in § 171.301(b)(1)(iii), which is “[u]sing an alternative machine-readable format,\nincluding the means to interpret the electronic health information, agreed upon with the\nrequestor.” If the actor offers the EHI in at least two manners including one of either (b)(1)(i) or\n(b)(1)(ii), then this factor of the finalized manner exception exhausted condition is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Responses to our request for comment on how many alternative manners an\nactor should be required to offer before this condition would be available reflected a broad range\nof perspectives. Many commenters said two alternative manners should be enough. Other\ncommenters said just one, and a couple of commenters suggested requiring actors to exhaust all\nof the actor’s own manners of exchange prior to making use of the condition. Another\ncommenter requested that an actor be required to demonstrate that they have inventoried all of\nthe information sharing tools available that could be offered as an alternative manner and require\nthe actor to have made those available to the requestor before they can satisfy the condition. One\ncommenter asked for a specific carve-out for health care providers that would only require them\nto offer access, exchange, or use in the manners supported by their certified health IT or any\nother manner that requires minimal effort. Another commenter suggested a specific carve-out for\nhealth care providers who do not use certified health IT, stating that it should be enough for such\nactors to offer access, exchange, and use only in a machine-readable manner. One commenter\nsuggested that ONC require actors to offer a minimum of two manners for USCDI data elements,\nand only one alternative manner for any EHI beyond USCDI.\n\n*Response.* After reviewing all comments, in § 171.204(a)(4)(ii), we have finalized the\nregulatory text so that the manner exception exhausted condition can be satisfied when an actor\n(who was unable to fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI because they could not\nreach an agreement with a requestor or were technically unable to fulfill the request in the\nmanner requested) offered the requestor at least two alternative manners, one of which must use\neither technology certified to standard(s) adopted in part 170 that is specified by the requestor\n(§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)) or published content and transport standards consistent with\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy requiring actors to offer at least one of the first two alternative manners (as listed in\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)-(iii)), we are balancing the interest of the actor in achieving certainty that the\npractice will fulfill the new condition, while also ensuring that interoperable, standards-based\nexchange remains favored over other methods of exchange. We believe that requiring all three\nalternative manners, as originally proposed, would place an unequal burden on actors who are\nnot required by other government regulations or incentivized by any public or private program to\nuse certified health IT. We believe that requiring two alternative manners, one of which must be\nmore interoperable than is typically the case with a machine-readable format (i.e.,\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii)), ensures that the condition will not have the undesirable effect of\ndampening actors’ or requestors’ enthusiasm for adopting and advancing standards-based\ninteroperability.\n\nThe finalized requirement for the actor to have offered at least two alternative manners\nalso balances the interests of those commenters who requested the condition be satisfied with just\none alternative manner and those who wanted all three alternative manners. While nothing would\nstop an actor from offering a requestor all available manners at its disposal, we believe making\nthat a requirement to satisfy the manner exception exhausted condition would render the\ncondition impractical for many actors to satisfy and defeat at least a portion of our purpose in\nproposing it: to offer actors a simpler option for certainty than was already available in the\ninfeasible under the circumstances condition. We also note that an actor could respond to a\nrequest by providing as much of the EHI as possible via any manner requested or an alternative\nmanner, and still make use of the infeasible under the circumstances condition for any other EHI\nthat they are technically unable to offer via an alternative manner, so long as the practice satisfies\nall the requirements of that condition (now § 171.204(a)(5)). As a reminder, to meet the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfeasibility Exception as a whole, actors will still, regardless of the condition(s) satisfied in\nparagraph (a) in § 171.204, also need to satisfy the condition in paragraph (b): responding to\nrequests.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed confusion over what exactly is an “alternative\nmanner.” One commenter stated that, taken literally, “all alternative manners” would force an\nactor to offer tens or hundreds of possible technical solutions.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and the opportunity to address the confusion.\n\nWhen referring to “alternative manners” we do not mean all possible manners of exchange other\nthan the manner requested. Rather, we specifically mean only manners that would be consistent\nwith subparagraph (i), (ii), or (iii) of § 171.301(b)(1). Offering as few as one option per category\nis sufficient to satisfy either paragraph (b)(1) of the alternative manner condition of the Manner\nException (§ 171.301) or the “at least two alternative manners” requirement finalized as part of\nthis manner exception exhausted condition (subparagraph (a)(4)) of the Infeasibility Exception\n(§ 171.204).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter asked that ONC clarify that responding actors are responsible\nto exchange EHI for the purpose and in the manner requested, if they are able to do so, even if\nthey are not accustomed to utilizing the requested transaction pattern.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to clarify. The commenter is incorrect. An actor\nmay satisfy any of the exceptions to the information blocking definition in order to have\ncertainty that their practice is not information blocking. Under the manner requested condition\n(now § 171. 301(a)) of the Manner Exception, an actor responding to a request to exchange EHI\nfor a certain purpose and in a certain manner must only do so if they are technically able to and\nreach an agreement with the requestor. If they are not technically able to do so, or cannot reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement with the requestor, then an actor seeking certainty that their practice would not be\ninformation blocking would need to either satisfy the other conditions of the Manner Exception\nor satisfy a different exception to the information blocking definition. The exceptions to the\ninformation blocking definition are voluntary and offer an actor certainty that a practice that\nsatisfies all of the applicable requirements and conditions of an exception at all relevant times\nwill not be considered information blocking.\n\nThe manner exception exhausted condition is not available when exchange is technically\nfeasible and can be accomplished consistent with the Manner Exception, whether because the\nparties have agreed to terms for fulfillment in the manner requested (manner requested\ncondition) or because the requestor has specified and/or agreed to accept access, exchange or use\nconsistent with the Manner Exception’s alternative manner condition — even if the actor is not\naccustomed to utilizing the requested manner to support access, exchange, or use of the EHI the\nrequestor seeks, in general or for the same or similar permissible purpose a particular requestor\nseeks EHI access, exchange, or use. In other words, this condition would not be available if a\nresponding actor is able to exchange EHI in the manner requested, and the parties have either\nreached agreeable terms for such access, exchange, or use; or the requestor has specified and/or\nagreed to accept such access, exchange or use in an alternative manner consistent with the\nManner Exception. We emphasize that nothing about the manner exception exhausted condition\nprevents an actor from providing a requestor with a custom build for access, exchange, or use of\nEHI. Rather, this condition has been adopted to alleviate actor uncertainty as to whether they\nmust provide the custom build or otherwise be considered to have engaged in information\nblocking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that in cases where a requestor seeks a specific alternative manner of access,\nexchange, or use consistent with § 171.301(b)(1), and the actor declines to offer that manner\n(even if the actor is able to accommodate the requested alternative manner) and instead offers a\ndifferent alternative manner, the OIG may consider this as a factor in determining whether\ninformation blocking has occurred, particularly if the requestor is unable to access, exchange or\nuse the EHI in the offered alternative manner. For example, if a requestor specifies a FHIR-based\nAPI as its preferred alternative manner of access, exchange, or use, and the actor is capable of\ndoing so, then the actor should prioritize fulfilling the request via FHIR, even if the actor is also\ncapable of fulfilling the request via another alternative manner, such as C-CDA document\nexchange. ONC has consistently maintained this policy approach because it best ensures that\nEHI is made available where and when it is needed (for further discussion, see the ONC Cures\nAct Final Rule at 85 FR 25877).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter stated that if an actor is unable to reach agreeable terms with a\nrequestor for access, exchange, or use of EHI, or is technically unable to fulfill a request in the\nmanner requested, and then proceeds to offer one or more alternative manners and the requestor\nis still not satisfied, then the burden should shift to the requestor to demonstrate and justify why\nthe alternatives proposed by the actor are infeasible or otherwise insufficient to meet their needs.\n\nFurther, the commenter stated that the actor who received the request should have a duty to\nrespond to the requestor only after receiving a written statement setting forth such justification.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. We decline to adopt this suggestion, however,\nbecause we find it inappropriate to entirely shift the burden to the requestor. Our information\nblocking regulatory scheme, consistent with the statutory information blocking definition,\nsupports policy goals of discouraging interference with EHI access, exchange, or use, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencouraging routine, interoperable EHI sharing for permissible purposes consistent with patients’\nprivacy preferences. Although we recognize there is substantial variation in actors’ and\nrequestors’ circumstances, we do not believe our policy goals would be well served by\nidentifying as “reasonable and necessary” any actor’s practice of demanding a requestor to\njustify to the actor their need or preference for a different manner of EHI access, exchange, or\nuse than the actor prefers to offer (42 U.S.C. 300jj—52). A key aim of our information blocking\nregulatory scheme is to discourage information blocking by actors and make it easier for\nrequestors to obtain, for any permissible purpose, EHI access, exchange, or use in a manner that\nmeets the requestor’s needs. The condition, as finalized, requires the actor to offer only two\nalternative manners, at least one of which is standards-based. It, therefore, allows the actor\nenough flexibility to avoid developing one-off, unique, custom solutions unless the actor wants\nto do so. The actor who satisfies the § 171.301 Manner Exception by meeting the manner\nrequested condition would not need to also satisfy any condition in the § 171.204 Infeasibility\nException, assuming all requested EHI was provided consistent with the Manner Exception. The\n§ 171.301(a) manner requested condition also, we reiterate, allows the actor and requestor to\ncome to any mutually agreeable terms, thereby allowing for those requestors, able and willing to\ndo so, to satisfy any financial incentive the actor would require to develop any requested manner,\nhowever unique or one-off, the requestor might want developed.\n\nComment. At least one commenter stated that this condition should still be available in\ncircumstances where the only applicable option is a “machine-readable format,” in other words,\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. As stated above, we have finalized this condition\nwith a requirement that the actor offer at least two “alternative manners” from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)-(iii), one of which must be either the alternative manner in § 171.301(b)(1)(i)\nor (b)(1)(ii). Because a machine-readable format is the option of last resort, and the least-\ninteroperable of all the alternative manners, we believe that allowing a requestor to offer only a\nmachine-readable format would be at odds with the purpose of the new condition. We note that\nan actor who is able only to offer access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner consistent with\n§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii) would not be able to make use of this condition but could still conform its\npractice to another applicable condition (for example, the infeasible under the circumstances\ncondition of the Infeasibility Exception) in order to have certainty that the practice would not\nconstitute information blocking. Moreover, even a practice that does not satisfy any exception\ndoes not automatically constitute information blocking. The facts and circumstances of any\nsituation or allegation would need to be evaluated, and whether the practice constitutes\ninformation blocking depends on the unique facts and circumstances of the practice.\n\nWhat counts as a “substantial number”?\nWe proposed, as the third factor of the manner exception exhausted condition, that the\ncondition would be available only if “the actor does not provide the same access, exchange, or\nuse of the requested electronic health information to a substantial number of individuals or\nentities that are similarly situated to the requestor.” In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we stated that\n“this factor as a whole serves a similar function to the § 171.204(a)(5) (originally codified in\n§ 171.204(a)(3)) infeasible under the circumstances condition's factor considering whether the\nactor's practice is non-discriminatory, and the actor provides the same access, exchange, or use\nof electronic health information to its companies or to its customers, suppliers, partners, and\nother persons with whom it has a business relationship” (88 FR 23870). We noted that the intent\nof the third factor is to provide a basic assurance that actors would not be able to misuse the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§ 171.204(a)(4) manner exception exhausted condition to avoid supplying some particular\nrequestor(s) with manner(s) of access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI that would be more\naccurately characterized as generally available than as new, unique, or unusual (88 FR 23870).\n\nGiven that intent, we stated that the proposed regulatory language of subparagraph (iii) of the\ncondition “while on its face may seem indefinite and is designed to address any potential request,\nis intended to ensure that the actor offers any requestor … the same access the actor provides to a\nsubstantial number of its customers …” (88 FR 23870). We requested comment on whether we\nshould further define “substantial number” for purposes of this condition.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters responded to this proposed provision of the manner\nexception exhausted condition. Some suggested we keep the “substantial number” flexible and\nnot further define it. One commenter suggested that we set a certain percentage such that an actor\nproviding the same access, exchange, or use to a percentage of its customers would not be able to\ndeny the requestor the same access, exchange, or use and still make use of this condition.\n\nAnother commenter suggested that even one customer should be enough, because just one\ncustomer can constitute the bulk of an actor’s business, or one customer can request a more\ninnovative manner that should be made available to all requestors without the use of the\ncondition to cover an actor’s practice of denying such access, exchange, or use. One requestor\nstated that “substantial number” was an inappropriate metric for the factor, because “generally\navailable” or other terms indicating the state of a product or service are not typically dependent\non the number of users but rather the actor’s ability to service any requests for such functionality.\n\nThe same commenter noted that lack of adoption of a given feature may occur for many reasons\nthat have no bearing on the usefulness of the feature, and therefore any functionality that is\nconsidered usable by customers should be considered normal and customary practice, even if\n\n\n\n\n\n\nonly one customer uses it. The commenter expressed concerns that the adoption level could be\nkept artificially low by telling initial requestors “no,” thereby preventing the particular feature\nfrom being considered “generally available” or similar. Another commenter said that if a\nfunctionality is considered usable by customers, then having any customer use it should be\nconsidered normal and customary practice, and it shouldn’t matter if, for a time, they are the only\ncustomer using that feature.\n\nOther commenters supported keeping the term “substantial number” without further\nspecifying a specific number. These commenters stated that such an approach allows the right\nlevel of flexibility, with one commenter remarking that it permits actors to consider the specific\nmeans of access, exchange, or use of EHI contemplated by each request and the specific use case\nfor which the request is made. Another commenter supported ONC’s reasoning for not using a\nfixed number to define “substantial number,” referring to the reasoning laid out in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (which is also discussed below).\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback and input. We have finalized in\n§ 171.204(a)(4)(iii) the term “substantial number” without further specificity. We believe this\nallows the appropriate amount of flexibility for all actor types, who may have very different\nnumbers of requestors, to satisfy this condition based on what number of requestors is substantial\nfor that actor. As we stated in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, using “substantial number” rather than a\nspecific number is important to recognize variation in actors’ operational contexts, including\ntheir organizational sizes. What may be a trivial number to a large health IT developer of\ncertified health IT might be an important or consequential (“substantial”) number for a small\nHIN/HIE (88 FR 23870). In addition, while we believe that calculating a percentage may be\nhelpful to an actor in determining whether it provides a substantial number of customers the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequested access, we do not believe establishing a specific percentage would be helpful given the\nwide variation in the number of customers an actor may have. For example, an actor with a large\nnumber of customers who provides the access to dozens of customers might only be providing\nsuch access to ten percent of its customers. Further, we did not propose such an approach for\nconsideration.\n\nIn response to commenters who suggested we use a specific number, such as one, we\nnote that in some cases, even one customer could be a substantial number, if, for example, it\nrepresents a large portion of the actor’s deployments or is considered “generally available” as\npart of an actor’s line of business (see below and 88 FR 23870 for a discussion of “generally\navailable/general availability”). Simply stating one, or more than one, could be overly broad and\nend up capturing one-off manners, custom builds, or highly customized deployments that are not\neasily replicable for another requestor without abandoning open consensus standards or\ninteroperable manners. In other words, we believe that “substantial number” is flexible enough to\ninclude as few as one customer, when appropriate, and as many as all of a given actor’s\ncustomers. Further, providing a fixed number could be considered arbitrary.\n\nIn response to commenters who noted that if a functionality is used by even one\ncustomer, it should be offered even if, for a time, there is only one customer using it. We agree\nthat there may be instances where just one customer is using a particular functionality that is\nsuitable and scalable for use by requestors beyond that one customer. However, in other\ninstances, a functionality may be in use by only one customer because it is a custom build that\nwould be difficult to replicate or scale, or because it is an obsolete product that this one customer\ncontinues to find sufficient for their needs. We, therefore, believe setting the standard that an\nactor cannot meet the manner exception exhausted condition if any one customer is using a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequested build could too often prevent the condition from applying when a requestor seeks a\nmanner that is not generally available or interoperable. Moreover, in the free market, especially\nuseful features would be expected to attract the notice of developers and their customers, with\nthe best features eventually being adopted by more than one customer.\n\nFinally, in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule preamble, we stated that we chose to structure the\n§ 171.204(a)(4)(iii) factor to align with the concept of whether the manner requested, including\ninvolved interoperability elements, is in a stage of development or overall lifecycle that would\nroughly approximate the “general availability” phase of the software release lifecycle, or a\nconceptually analogous phase for non-software interoperability elements (88 FR 23870).\n\nHowever, we recognize that not all actors are developers, and we intend this condition of the\nInfeasibility Exception to be available for all types of § 171.102 actors. As we stated in the HTI-\n1 Proposed Rule, health care providers, for example, do not typically develop software for the\nmarket and, in our observation, are likely to characterize components of their health IT systems\nin more operational terms—such as what has “gone live” in their particular implementation—\nthan in software release lifecycle terms. We believe avoiding the specific lifecycle term also\navoids potential for misunderstandings among actors and requestors, or for gamesmanship on the\npart of actors, around when different actors consider a particular interoperability element to enter\nor to be withdrawn from “general availability” as the term is widely used in the software sector.\n\nWe finalize “substantial number” with the same analysis and guidance found in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule (see 88 FR 23870 through 23871).\n\nWhat does “provide” mean in this context?\nComments. We received three comments requesting clarification of the term “provides”\nas used in the manner exception exhausted condition. A couple of commenters asked ONC to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclarify that this condition includes only current methods of sharing data, and not former,\nreplaced, or outdated methods of exchange. Another commenter noted that clarification of the\nterm “provide” in this context is even more important, given other proposals related to\ninformation blocking that also include concepts like “making available” or “providing.” One\ncomment speculated the definition of provide included in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule at § 171.102\n(information blocking definitions) was included for purposes of this condition, indicating that it\nwas unclear why the definition was proposed and that if finalized in the proposed form, it may\nadd confusion to the provisions of the conditions of information blocking exceptions in general.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We use the word “provide” in\n§ 171.204(a)(4)(iii) without further definition. We unintentionally included a definition of\nprovide in § 171.102 (information blocking definitions) in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule. We have\nnot finalized any definition of the word “provide” in § 171.102. Further, we emphasize that the\ndefinition of provide finalized in § 170.102 (health information technology certification program\ndefinitions) is not applicable for 45 CFR part 171.\n\nWe offer the following points of clarification specific, and limited in effect, to our use of\nthe word “provide” in § 171.204(a)(4)(iii). First, as we stated in the preamble of the HTI-1\nProposed Rule, our use of “provide” in the present tense is both precise and deliberative. This\nfactor tests for whether the actor currently provides the same manner to a substantial number of\nindividuals or entities who are similarly situated to any given requestor. Looking only at what the\nactor currently provides excludes manners that are nearing or have exceeded the end of their\nsupported life cycles (88 FR 23870). We recommend reviewing the examples in the HTI-1\nProposed Rule related to “provide” in context of § 171.204(a)(4)(iii) and note that they remain\nappropriate as further explanation of our finalized policy (88 FR 23870).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should “similarly situated” be determined?\nIn the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we discussed that the concept of “similarly situated” is\nfamiliar because we also use the phrase in the Fees Exception (§ 171.302) and Licensing\nException (§ 171.303). We noted that it would serve here, as it does there, to indicate that\ndifferent specific individuals or entities within a class of such individuals or entities who are\nsimilarly situated to one another should be treated in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner\n(88 FR 23871). We also stated that it is not our intent for the “individuals or entities that are\nsimilarly situated to the requester” criteria of this new proposed condition to be used in a way\nthat differentiates the same access to EHI simply based on the requestor's status, such as\nindividual (e.g., a patient) or entity (e.g., a healthcare system) (88 FR 23871).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested that ONC provide more specific information on\nthe types of characteristics that would designate entities as similarly situated and provide\nexamples or guidance on ways for actors to easily group and document that entities are similarly\nsituated. One commenter expressed concern about the lack of clarity related to the “similarly\nsituated” clause. Another commenter argued that the term was inappropriate and what should\nmatter is not the requesting entity’s circumstances but its intended purpose of use for the\nrequested interoperability functionality, whether the use aligns with what the functionality was\ndesigned to support, and whether the use requires any substantially new development work.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and have adjusted the finalized policy to address\ncommenters’ concerns. As we noted in the preamble to the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, “similarly\nsituated” in the manner exception exhausted condition’s third factor was meant to function in a\nfashion similar to the non-discrimination provisions in the Fees and Licensing Exceptions (88\nFR 23871). However, with the use of the term “similarly situated,” we were proposing to permit\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertain discrimination of requestors based on the similarity of their situations to those already\nbeing provided access, exchange, or use. As a comparison, we did not permit any discrimination\nunder a parallel construction of one of the factors used for the analysis under the infeasibility\nunder the circumstances condition of the Infeasibility Exception (compare “Whether the actor's\npractice is non-discriminatory and the actor provides the same access, exchange, or use of\nelectronic health information to its companies or to its customers, suppliers, partners, and other\npersons with whom it has a business relationship;” 45 CFR 171.204(a)(5)(i)(D)).\n\nWe provided guidance in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule on our thinking of how a\ndetermination of similarly situated would work. We first provided an example of categorizing\nrequestors into “similarly situated” categories based on the size of the healthcare entity. We then\nspecified that even within these different categories, requestors would not be treated differently\nbased on extraneous factors, such as whether any of them may be competitors of the responding\nactor or may obtain more of their health IT from the actor's competitors than from the actor (88\nFR 23871). Finally, we noted that it was not our intent for the “individuals or entities that are\nsimilarly situated to the requester” criteria to be used in a way that differentiates the same access\nto EHI simply based on the requestor's status, such as individual (e.g., a patient) or entity (e.g., a\nhealthcare system).\n\nBased on comments received and further consideration of our proposal and examples, we\nhave revised the condition to exclude certain factors from a similarly situated determination and\nare providing additional clarification and guidance. Consistent with the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we\nclarify that “similarly situated” cannot be used to discriminate against requestors based on\nwhether the requestor is a competitor of the actor or whether the requestor will or might use the\nrequested access, exchange, or use in a way that facilitates competition with the actor. Similarly,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas we noted above and in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23871), an actor cannot discriminate\nin providing a form of access, exchange, or use of EHI that it currently provides to a substantial\nnumber of individuals or entities solely based on the requestor’s status. In this regard, we are\nspecifically clarifying in regulation text (§ 171.204(a)(4)(iv)) that such statuses include requests\nby individuals, as we define that term in § 171.202(a), and the health care provider type and size.\n\nRegarding health care provider type (e.g., radiology specialty practice or long-term post-acute\ncare facility) and size, we believe further clarity is necessary based on comments and the\nexample we provided in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and recited above. While the example in the\nHTI-1 Proposed Rule may have suggested that size groupings are acceptable, we clarify that\nsuch groupings as “similarly situated” would be appropriate in terms of administering costs and\nlicensing agreements under the respective Fees and Licensing Exceptions but would not be\nappropriate for discriminating in actually providing access, exchange, or use of EHI that the\nactor provides to a substantial number of individuals or entities. Costs associated with providing\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI or costs associated with licensing interoperability elements, can\nlogically vary based on the size of the entity, so it makes sense to use this category for the Fees\nand Licensing Exceptions. However, we don’t see a similar reason to discriminate based on the\nentity’s size when an actor seeks to satisfy this condition of the Infeasibility Exception because if\nan actor already provides such access to a substantial number of entities, there is not a parallel\ncorrelation that would make it infeasible to provide such access to a “differently” sized\nrequestor.\n\nAs an example, if a solo practitioner requests access, exchange, or use of certain EHI in\nthe same manner that an actor provides such access, exchange, or use of the same EHI to a large\nhospital system, then the actor would not be able to discriminate based on the difference between\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe requestors (large hospital system versus solo practitioner) and still use this condition to cover\nthe practice.\n\nOverall, these adjustments are responsive to comments and provide further clarity for the\nconcept of “similarly situated” as it applies to this condition under the Infeasibility Exception.\n\nOther Comments\nComment. One commenter asked that actors be required to report any requests that they\nhave rejected.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment but decline to finalize such a policy at this time as\nwe did not propose such an approach.\n\nComment. A few commenters asked ONC to explain why the first requirement of this\nnew condition restates “technical inability” as the reason for the infeasibility under the Manner\nException when the Manner Exception itself provides that an actor must fulfill the EHI request\nin the manner requested “unless the actor is technically unable to fulfill the request or cannot\nreach agreeable terms with the requestor to fulfill the request in the manner requested.” A\ncommenter asked ONC to explain how this alternative requirement in the manner exception\nexhausted condition is materially different from the options for meeting the first requirement.\n\n*Response.* There is no substantive difference between the “technical inability” under the\nManner Exception and this new condition. However, this requirement has been restated as it falls\nunder a new condition and under a different exception. ONC’s intent in including the technical\ninfeasibility requirement is to ensure that an actor who cannot, for technical reasons, fulfill a\nrequest for any access, exchange, or use of EHI in any manner requested is able to use this\ncondition (provided all other relevant provisions are also met) and an actor who does have the\ntechnical capability to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner requested but\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor may also make use of this new condition\n(provided all other relevant provisions are also met). In other words, an actor who can\ntechnically fulfill the request but cannot reach agreeable terms can still make use of this\ncondition, so long as all other relevant provisions are met.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in response to this new condition (and in\nresponse to other proposals in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule) advocating we review or revise\nparagraph (b) of the Infeasibility Exception, which requires an actor that does not fulfill a request\nfor access, exchange, or use of EHI consistent with any of the conditions in paragraph (a) of\n§ 171.204 “provide to the requestor in writing the reason(s) why the request is infeasible” within\nten business days of receipt of the request. One commenter noted that requests often come in\nwithout the needed level of detail, meaning the developer must ask questions and wait for\nanswers from the requestor before determining whether the request is feasible. In such instances,\nthe commenter stated, the timeliness rests on the requestor and not the responding actor, and\ntherefore a ten-day time frame is insufficient. The commenter further contends that the ten-day\nclock should “toll” until sufficient information about the request has been received. Other\ncommenters expressed agreement that ten days was too short, too inflexible, and unrealistic.\n\nAnother commenter asked ONC to clarify that where an actor intends to apply the manner\nexception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception that the ten-day time frame begins\nonly after the actor and requestor have not been able to agree on an acceptable alternative\nmanner under the Manner Exception. Another commenter noted that the ten-day time frame was\nso unrealistic as to preclude the use of the exception in situations where it would otherwise be\nrelevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* While we appreciate the comments, we did not propose any changes to the ten-\nday time frame in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule and are not finalizing any changes to paragraph (b)\nof § 171.204 in this final rule. We may consider these comments in relation to future regulatory\naction and guidance.\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the HTI-1 Proposed Rule, we proposed to add in § 171.301(c) a TEFCA manner\ncondition to the proposed revised and renamed Manner Exception codified in 45 CFR 171.301.\n\nThe proposed condition was stated as follows: “If an actor who is a QHIN, Participant, or\nSubparticipant offers to fulfill a request for EHI access, exchange, or use for any purpose\npermitted under the Common Agreement and Framework Agreement(s) from any other QHIN,\nParticipant, or Subparticipant using Connectivity Services, QHIN Services, or the specified\ntechnical services in the applicable Framework Agreement, then: (i) The actor is not required to\noffer the EHI in any alternative manner; (ii) Any fees charged by the actor in relation to fulfilling\nthe request are not required to satisfy the exception in § 171.302; and (iii) Any license of\ninteroperability elements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the request is not required\nto satisfy the exception in § 171.303” (88 FR 23872).\n\nIn proposing this condition, we sought to offer actors certainty that fulfilling, or even\nattempting to fulfill, requests for EHI using Connectivity Services, QHIN Services, or the\nspecified technical services in the applicable Framework Agreement (“TEFCA means”) would\nsatisfy the Manner Exception when an actor and requestors are parties to the Common\nAgreement or a Framework Agreement under the Common Agreement. As proposed, this would\nhave been the case even when the EHI may have exceeded the minimum data classes and\nelements required by the Common Agreement as of the date a particular request is fulfilled,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassuming the TEFCA means could support the requested access, exchange, or use of the EHI.\n\nWe stated that the proposed condition could be satisfied regardless of whether the requestor\ninitially requested access, exchange, or use via TEFCA means or some other manner (88 FR\n23872). We noted that another important feature of the proposal was that it could be satisfied by\nthe actor either fulfilling or offering to fulfill the requestor’s request for EHI, again, assuming the\nTEFCA means could support the requested access, and exchange, or use of the EHI. We stated\nthat the approach aligns with the Cures Act’s goals for interoperability and the establishment of\nTEFCA by acknowledging the value of TEFCA in promoting access, exchange, and use of EHI\nin a secure and interoperable way.\n\nWe stated that the proposed condition would identify as “reasonable and necessary” an\nactor’s practice of prioritizing use of TEFCA means, in lieu of other feasible manners, for all\nEHI for which access, exchange, or use can be supported by TEFCA means for both the actor\nand requestor, so long as the requestor is a TEFCA entity (QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant)\nand the purpose is permitted under the TEFCA governing agreements. This would be true\nregardless of whether the request is initially made through TEFCA means or otherwise; and\nregardless of whether all of the particular data classes or exchange purposes are yet required by\nTEFCA’s governing agreements to be returned in response to a TEFCA request (88 FR 23873).\n\nThe condition was designed to provide a clear, efficient regulatory path to prioritize exchange\namongst QHINs, Participants, and Subparticipants in TEFCA using TEFCA means of sharing\nany and all EHI that TEFCA means can support.\n\nWe requested comment on this proposal and received a substantial number of responses\nfrom commenters. These comments are summarized and addressed below.\n\nSummary of Finalized Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the reasons explained below, rather than include this condition as part of the Manner\nException, we have finalized a new subpart to the information blocking exceptions – Subpart D,\n“Exceptions That Involve Practices Related to Actors’ Participation in The Trusted Exchange\nFramework and Common Agreement (TEFCA).” The new subpart consists of three sections,\n§ 171.400 “availability and effect of exceptions,” which mirrors §§ 171.200 and 171.300, stating\nthat a practice shall not be treated as information blocking if the actor satisfies an exception to\nthe information blocking provision as set forth in this subpart D by meeting all applicable\nrequirements and conditions of the exception at all relevant times. We have reserved § 171.401\nfor definitions in future rulemaking and reserved § 171.402 for future use as well. At § 171.403,\nwe finalized a TEFCA Manner Exception that is based on the TEFCA manner condition\nproposed in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule.\n\nSimilar to the proposed condition, the new TEFCA Manner Exception (§ 171.403)\nprovides that an actor’s practice of limiting the manner in which it fulfills a request for access,\nexchange, or use EHI to providing such access, exchange or use only via TEFCA will not be\nconsidered information blocking when the practice follows these conditions:\n(a) The actor and requestor are both part of TEFCA;\n(b) The requestor is capable of such access, exchange, or use of the requested EHI from\nthe actor via TEFCA;\n(c) The request for access, exchange, or use of EHI is not via the standards adopted in 45\nCFR 170.215 or version approved pursuant to 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8); and\n(d) Any fees charged by the actor and the terms for any license of interoperability\nelements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the request are required to satisfy,\nrespectively, the Fees Exception (§ 171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first condition, in § 171.403(a), that the actor and requestor are both part of TEFCA,\nsimply means that both the actor and the requestor must be either a QHIN, Participant, or\nSubparticipant, as those terms are defined in the Common Agreement as published at 88 FR\n76773. For brevity, in the preamble, we will refer to these three terms collectively as “TEFCA\nentities” or a “TEFCA entity.” This exception will not be available in any situation where the\nactor, or the requestor, is not a part of TEFCA.\n\nThe second condition, in § 171.403(b), requires that the requestor must be capable of\nreceiving (accessing, exchanging, or using, depending on the requestor’s request) the EHI from\nthe actor, via TEFCA. In the Proposed Rule, we used the term “TEFCA means” to describe\nfulfilling requests for EHI using Connectivity Services, QHIN Services, or the specified\ntechnical services in the applicable Framework Agreement (88 FR 23872, as those terms are\ndefined at 88 FR 76773). In this final rule and in the regulation text, we describe an actor’s\npractice of responding to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI “via TEFCA” to indicate that\nan actor may use any of the services described by “TEFCA means” consistent with the terms that\nboth the actor and requestor separately agreed to for access to such TEFCA means, and\nconsistent with the other conditions of the exception.\n\nAs finalized in § 171.403(b), the exception’s condition for responding to requests for EHI\nthat the requestor can obtain from the actor via TEFCA uses “via TEFCA” to communicate that\nthe actor makes the EHI available, and the requestor is able to obtain the requested access,\nexchange, or use of the requested EHI using—what we referenced in the HTI-1 Proposed Rule as\nmaking EHI available through “TEFCA means” (88 FR 23872). This includes where Participants\nand Subparticipants may be exchanging EHI within the same QHIN or across different QHINs.\n\nIn cases where the requestor is not capable of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI via\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTEFCA, for example because the requestor does not support such exchange methods or its QHIN\ndoes not, an actor would not be able to make use of this exception.\n\nThe third condition, in § 171.403(c), excludes requests from the exception where the\nrequestor seeks to access, exchange, or use EHI via the “Application Programming Interface\nStandards,” (or API standards) (45 CFR 170.215) adopted by ONC on behalf of the Secretary or\nanother version of those standards approved pursuant to the “Standards Version Advancement\nProcess” (45 CFR 170.405(b)(8)) under the ONC Health IT Certification Program. When a\nrequestor seeks to access EHI via those API standards (essentially FHIR-based standards), an\nactor cannot use this exception. In other words, the third condition functions as a carve-out in\nthat the exception is not available if the requestor requested access, exchange, or use of EHI via\nthe API standards.\n\nThe fourth and final requirement for this condition, in § 171.403(d), states that any fees\nan actor charges, and any licensing terms an actor sets, must comply with the Fees Exception (§\n171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303). This exception in § 171.403 would not be\navailable in any situations where all four of these conditions are not satisfied.\n\nRather than finalize the proposed definitions, in order to maintain consistency between\nthe most current version of the Common Agreement and this regulation, we have decided to refer\nto the definitions used in the Common Agreement (88 FR 76773) for the terms used in this\nexception. The relevant definitions are similar to, or the same as, the terms we proposed to define\nin the proposed TEFCA manner condition. For example, when we refer to Framework\nAgreement(s), we mean any one or combination of the Common Agreement, a Participant-QHIN\nAgreement, a Participant-Subparticipant Agreement, or a Downstream Subparticipant\nAgreement, as applicable. A Qualified Health Information Network (QHIN) is, as defined in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmost recent version of the Common Agreement, a health information network (as defined in §\n171.102) that is a U.S. entity that has been designated by the Recognized Coordinating Entity\n(RCE) and is a party to the Common Agreement countersigned by the RCE. Both Participant and\nSubparticipant are defined as they are in the Common Agreement (88 FR 76773). In some cases,\nsuch as with the term Connectivity Services, the definition proposed is different from the most\nrecent version of the Common Agreement, where it is defined as the technical services provided\nby a QHIN consistent with the requirements of the then-applicable QHIN Technical Framework\nand pursuant to the Common Agreement with respect to all Exchange purposes. The Common\nAgreement also defines Individual Access Services (IAS) as the services provided to an\nIndividual by a QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant that has a direct contractual relationship\nwith such Individual in which the QHIN, Participant or Subparticipant, as applicable, agrees to\nsatisfy that Individual’s ability to access, inspect, or obtain a copy of that Individual’s Required\nInformation using TEFCA Exchange. We decided to reserve 171.401 for possible future use to\nincorporate these definitions into the regulatory framework.\n\nTimeliness of Exception\nComments. Some commenters stated that it would be premature to adopt this proposal.\n\nCommenters noted that TEFCA is in its early stages and has not yet launched. Others suggested\nONC take a “wait and see” approach, monitor TEFCA deployments for utility, completeness,\ntimeliness, ease of access, security, privacy, transparency, and consumer participation, and then\nfinalize an exception only if real world experience demonstrates a need. A commenter noted that\nTEFCA is a voluntary program that does not support the full breadth of use cases for EHI, and\nthat such an exception will designate other pathways as “less interoperable” even if they have\nequal or greater utility compared to exchange through TEFCA. Another commenter appreciated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONC’s support for greater interoperability, but also stated it was too soon to establish this\ncondition because it could result in less sharing of information in the early stages of TEFCA’s\ndevelopment. The commenter suggested, as an alternative, that TEFCA-based exchange should\nbe included as a preferred approach to sharing EHI, but not in a way that enables an actor to deny\na request if the requestor cannot receive it via TEFCA-based exchange.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. The policy as proposed (88 FR 23873) and as\nfinalized in the new TEFCA Manner Exception is only available when both the actor and the\nrequestor are in TEFCA, which we believe eliminates the concerns about the timeliness of\nidentifying as reasonable and necessary the practices that satisfy the exception. Entities will join\nTEFCA with the expectation that they will exchange EHI using TEFCA when possible. This\nexception reinforces that practice. No actor is required to join TEFCA, so those that do so will do\nso with the knowledge that this exception is available in certain circumstances. As a voluntary\nexception, no actor is required to make use of the exception – which we believe further negates\nthe timeliness concerns. In addition, an actor will not be able to use this exception if, for\nwhatever reason, the requestor is not capable of accessing, exchanging, or using the requested\nEHI via TEFCA. In such cases, an actor would need to provide the EHI in the manner requested,\nor in an alternative manner agreed upon with the requestor or use another exception to cover the\npractice to attain certainty that the actor’s practice will not be considered information blocking.\n\nFees and Licensing Terms Concerns\nComments. Many commenters expressed concern that we did not propose to apply the\nrestrictions found in the Fees Exception (§ 171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303) to\nthis condition. These commenters contended that, without such application, actors would be able\nto charge outrageous fees or set unreasonable licensing terms for interoperability elements. Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommenters noted that such fees could interfere with an individual’s right to access their EHI. A\ncouple of commenters asserted that, as proposed, the condition could result in applications that\ncharge patients for their services as the only realistic way for patients to get their EHI. Some\ncommenters further asserted that because the only fees that are prohibited in the Common\nAgreement are fees charged between QHINs, Participants and Sub-participants would be able to\ncharge fees for exchange of EHI that would not need to satisfy the Fees Exception.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and believe the commenters raised valid\nconcerns. In fact, when proposing the TEFCA manner condition, we mistakenly assumed that all\nactors participating in TEFCA would have already reached overarching agreements on fees and\nlicensing such that there would be no need for application of the Fees and Licensing Exceptions.\n\n(See 88 FR 23872, “[the proposal] facilitates an actor reaching agreeable terms with a requestor\nto fulfill an EHI request and acknowledges that certain agreements have been reached for the\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI (for example, by using standards consistent with the Common\nAgreement or applicable flow-down Framework agreements that the actor and requestor have\nagreed to abide by)” (emphasis added)). In fact, the Common Agreement is silent on fees except\nto forbid QHINs from charging fees to other QHINs. Therefore, to correct our misunderstanding\nand in consideration of comments, we have finalized the exception to include that any fees\ncharged by the actor, and any licensing of interoperability elements, must satisfy the Fees\nException (§ 171.302) and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303). It was never our intent to permit\nfees or licensing agreements that would not satisfy the information blocking regulations, either\nby being agreed to ahead of time, as we presumed, or by satisfying the Fees and Licensing\nExceptions.\n\nConcerns Regarding EHI Accessibility and Fees for Individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Many requestors expressed concerns that the proposed TEFCA condition\nwould interfere with an individual’s access to their own EHI. One commenter stated that the\ncondition could be used to elect out of participating in Individual Access Services in a national\nnetwork capacity. The commenter stated that while responding to individual requests via TEFCA\nis required (by the Common Agreement), QHINs are not required to initiate support for\nIndividual Access Services. One commenter expressed concerns that the exception will make it\nmore difficult for patients to get provider and payer data, and that patients who do not understand\nhow networks function will be disadvantaged compared to others. A few commenters expressed\nconcern about patient matching within the TEFCA network. One commenter expressed concerns\nabout sensitive data, citing reproductive health care as an example, and how a patient could\ncontrol access to such EHI. Some commenters indicated they were especially concerned with\npatient privacy and the ability for applications to charge for access to patient data or possibly\n“traffic” EHI through “dark data” exchanges. A commenter encouraged ONC to focus on FHIR-\nbased interoperability. A few commenters expressed concerns that the proposal would allow\nactors to charge individuals for access to their own data. Another commenter expressed\nsignificant concerns that the exception would permit charging fees to Individual Access Services\n(IAS) providers who are looking to access healthcare data on behalf of individuals.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. Consistent with our proposal, the policy, as\nfinalized, is applicable only when both the actor and the requestor are part of TEFCA (88 FR\n23873, see also 88 FR 23917-23918). We would like to assure commenters that this exception\ncannot be used in any case when an individual is requesting EHI, because an individual cannot\nbe a QHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant under TEFCA. If the individual is using TEFCA’s\nIndividual Access Services to query for or retrieve EHI via TEFCA instead of seeking to access,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use EHI directly from their health care provider’s portal or FHIR APIs, then the\nQHIN, Participant, or Subparticipant, in its role as an IAS provider, would be querying via\nTEFCA, not the individual. Furthermore, as described previously, the finalized exception\nincludes the requirement that any fees charged for the access, exchange, or use of the EHI must\nsatisfy the Fees Exception (§ 171.302), which specifically prohibits charging a patient (including\na third-party app on the patient’s behalf) for API or other electronic access to the patient’s EHI\n(§ 171.302(b)(1) and (2)). Regarding patient privacy, all § 171.102 actors are required to protect\npatients’ privacy and restrict the access, exchange, and use of EHI as required by all applicable\nlaw, including, but not limited to, the HIPAA Privacy Rule for actors to whom the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule applies.\n\nPatient matching within TEFCA is addressed by applicable policy and technical\nprocedures as well as associated agreements under TEFCA. For purposes of information\nblocking, any actor who receives a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI that the actor\nknows, or reasonably suspects, is misidentified or mismatched and who seeks certainty as to the\nconditions under which they can withhold such EHI without engaging in information blocking\nwill want to consult the Preventing Harm Exception in 45 CFR 171.201, which recognizes this\ntype of risk in § 171.201(c)(2).\n\nConcerns Regarding Interoperability and FHIR APIs\nComments. Many commenters expressed concerns with the limited manner of exchange\ninitially available in TEFCA and noted that when TEFCA officially launches, the Common\nAgreement will require only IHE document-based exchange. Commenters stated that restricting\nTEFCA entities to IHE document-based exchange would limit the use of EHI exchanged in that\nmanner, would limit interoperability by not requiring the use of modernized exchange protocols\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike FHIR, and could even disincentivize joining TEFCA. Others noted that our proposal would\npush actors to one exchange mechanism over another, which would remove choice and\noptionality and could potentially eliminate or discourage use of other exchange options, such as\nFHIR APIs, that may be preferable for some use cases. A few commenters noted that many\nhealth IT developers of certified health IT plan to connect their customers to TEFCA such that\ntheir customers will have to actively choose to opt out. Commenters expressed concerns that\nmost actors will likely be Participants or Sub-participants and, therefore, “subject to this\nexception.” As a result, one of these commenters stated that most of the information blocking\nregulations would be folded into the TEFCA framework, which lags behind today’s use of FHIR\nAPIs.\n\nOther commenters noted that requestors may have practical reasons to ask for EHI in\nways other than what TEFCA supports. Commenters encouraged ONC to advance support for\nHL7 FHIR within TEFCA as quickly as possible to allow third-party applications to access data\nmore easily on behalf of individuals. A few commenters noted that section 4003(a) of the Cures\nAct defined interoperability as health information technology that enables the secure exchange of\nelectronic health information with, and use of electronic health information from, other health\ninformation technology without special effort on the part of the user. The commenters claimed\nthat the proposed TEFCA condition would require special effort on the part of the user,\nparticularly with the use of IHE document protocol. Other commenters stated that entities should\nbe able to choose the best interoperability mechanisms and request data in any format the current\nsource can reasonably support using an exchange mechanism both can support. A commenter\nstated that, because there may be a delay before TEFCA widely implements the use of FHIR for\nall of the stated “exchange purposes,” organizations should be able to negotiate for the manner of\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccess that best suits their requirements. In particular, the commenter stated that organizations\nshould be allowed to prioritize using EHR systems’ SMART on FHIR patient API endpoints,\nand for population-level use cases, bulk FHIR export, even if TEFCA supports access to such\nEHI in another manner.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. Currently, TEFCA includes IHE\ndocument-based exchange, but publicly available documents note that FHIR exchange is a\nTEFCA priority and is planned for availability in 2024. IHE document-based exchange is a\nlongstanding standard for exchanging EHI. For example, organizations supporting health\ninformation exchange nationally (e.g., CommonWell Health Alliance, eHealth Exchange,\nCarequality) generally use IHE profiles such as Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD)<sup>258</sup>\nand Cross-Community Access (XCA)<sup>259</sup>\nto enable clinical document exchange between disparate\ncommunities.<sup>260</sup>\nHowever, as many commenters pointed out, FHIR-based exchange has certain\nadvantages over IHE document-based exchange. Over time, QHINs, Participants, and\nSubparticipants may well be required to support broader uses of FHIR-based exchange, but it is\nalso likely that many Participants and Subparticipants will continue to use document-based\nexchange instead of FHIR-based exchange for several transition years.<sup>261</sup>\nIn addition, the\ninformation blocking exceptions are all voluntary and are not “required” of any actor. The\nexceptions serve to offer certainty to actors that by conforming a practice to the conditions of an\n\n\nFootnote 258:\nIHE Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) profile - available in the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical\nFramework Volume 1: Integration Profiles at:\nhttps://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_TF_Rev17-0_Vol1_FT_2020-07-20.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 259:\nIHE Cross-Community Access (XCA) profile - available in the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework\nVolume 1: Integration Profiles at: https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_TF_Rev17-\n0_Vol1_FT_2020-07-20.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 260:\nhttps://rce.sequoiaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/QTF_0122.pdf\n\n\nFootnote 261:\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/tefca/coming-in-hot-tefca-will-soon-be-live-and-add-support-for-fhir-based-\nexchange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexception, such practice will not constitute information blocking. A Participant or Subparticipant\nin TEFCA is not “subject to” any exceptions, but if such entity is an actor (as defined in §\n171.102), the new finalized exception would be available along with all the other exceptions.\n\nIn consideration of both our stated goal to incentivize TEFCA participation and\ncomments suggesting that ONC should be promoting the use of FHIR-based APIs (for example,\nthe standards codified in 45 CFR 170.215, “Application Programming Interface Standards”), we\nhave limited the finalized exception’s availability. Specifically, in instances where an actor that\nis part of TEFCA receives a request to access, exchange, or use EHI via the API standards\nadopted in 45 CFR 170.215, including updated versions of such standards as may be approved\nfor voluntary use in the ONC Health IT Certification Program pursuant to 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8),\nthe Standards Version Advancement Process, the actor cannot meet the finalized TEFCA\nManner Exception. We finalized this policy in § 171.403(c), providing a limitation on the use of\nthe exception in that it does not apply to a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI via the\nstandards adopted in 45 CFR 170.215, including version(s) of those standards approved pursuant\nto 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8). This approach ensures that requestors seeking to access, exchange, or\nuse EHI via FHIR-based APIs can request such access and be assured that an actor cannot use\nthe TEFCA Manner Exception to limit the manner in which it fulfills the request to only via\nTEFCA. As many commenters noted, FHIR APIs advance interoperability to a greater degree\nthan IHE document-based exchange, which is a currently permitted exchange mechanism under\nTEFCA. With the goals of the proposed condition to acknowledge agreements reached by parties\nand to promote both interoperability and TEFCA adoption (88 FR 23872-23873), the FHIR-\nbased API limitation in § 171.403(c) is necessary to achieve these goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is crucial to note that an actor (e.g., a health IT developer of certified health IT) that\nparticipates in the ONC Health IT Certification Program cannot simply “turn off” API\ncapabilities, outside of TEFCA, to avoid offering such access, exchange, or use to a requestor.\n\nAny developer that has chosen to participate in the Program is subject to the Conditions of\nMaintenance and Certification requirements in subpart D of 45 CFR part 170. The API\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.404 apply to health IT\ndevelopers that certify health IT to FHIR-based API certification criteria. Such developers would\nnot be compliant with the API Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements if they\ndo not, among other requirements, publish APIs and allow EHI access, exchange, and use\nthrough the APIs. Any actor with certified health IT who has deployed “certified API\ntechnology” (as defined in § 170.404(c)) or other API technology using the standards and\nimplementation specifications adopted in § 170.215, who disables, disconnects, or otherwise\n“turns off” such API technology or requestors’ connections in order to avoid offering such\naccess, exchange, or use after joining TEFCA would do so explicitly outside the applicability of\nthe TEFCA Manner Exception finalized in § 171.403 and such practices could constitute\ninformation blocking.\n\nThe TEFCA Manner Exception, as finalized, is not in conflict with the PHSA section\n3000(9) definition of “interoperability” or with other ONC regulations. The exception only\napplies to entities that choose to voluntarily participate in TEFCA and agree to the\ninteroperability means available under TEFCA, while also preserving the availability of\ninteroperable FHIR APIs to requestors for the access, exchange, and use of EHI.\n\nIn sum, we believe that the proposed approach would not have led to most of the negative\nconsequences for FHIR API adoption theorized by commenters. However, to address such\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconfusion and concern and continue to incentivize TEFCA participation, in § 171.403(c), we\nhave finalized the explicit limitation condition within the exception to remove any doubt about\nperceived conflicts between TEFCA and FHIR API adoption. ONC has been and will continue to\nbe at the forefront of driving both TEFCA and FHIR API adoption across the industry and the\nFederal Government.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters noted that some EHI requestors who will likely be part of\nTEFCA may not have the technical capability to make requests or receive responses for certain\npermitted but optional exchange purposes.\n\n*Response.* In situations where a requestor does not support the capability to make or\nreceive requests or perform other transmissions for certain Exchange Purposes (including those\nthat do not require a response), the TEFCA Manner Exception would not be available because\nthe requestor would not have such access, exchange, or use of the EHI consistent with the\nrequestor capability condition in paragraph (b) of § 171.403.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that the proposed TEFCA manner condition could\ninterfere with state reporting requirements, because, for example, some states require payers to\nexchange data within a specified network based on existing federal rules. One commenter stated\nthat the condition risked discriminating against mechanisms of exchange and interoperability that\nare feasible and even required to be used by regional or local authorities. Another commenter\nstated that the inclusion of this exception demonstrates that there may be conflicting or confusing\nmandates under different federal programs, making compliance with information blocking\nregulations more difficult. The commenter urged ONC to continue to review how all federal and\nstate laws, regulations, and programs interact to relieve the unnecessary burden of varying\nrequirements that may not align. A commenter stated that the proposed condition risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscriminating against exchange mechanisms and interoperability pathways that are otherwise\ncommercially and technically feasible, and in some cases, required under law. The commenter\nnoted that a diversion of such exchanges to TEFCA would result in the loss of useful information\nthat should be added to the patient’s record to provide additional context for clinical care.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. We remind commenters that the exceptions exist\nas a voluntary means for actors to gain assurance that their practice(s) does not constitute\ninformation blocking; and similarly, participating in TEFCA is voluntary. Compliance with an\nexception set forth in subpart B, C, or newly finalized D of 45 CFR part 171, would mean that an\nactor’s practice does not meet the definition of information blocking in § 171.103. However, this\nwould not, in or of itself, immunize the actor from any other consequences to which they are\nsubject to for violating, ignoring, or otherwise failing to comply with other applicable laws.\n\nIn response to concerns that the exception risks discriminating against exchange\nmechanisms and interoperability pathways that are otherwise commercially and technically\nfeasible, we note that a requestor can request EHI in any manner, and an actor may seek to\nsatisfy the manner requested condition of the Manner Exception (§ 171.301(a)) and respond in\nthat manner, if the actor and requestor can come to agreeable terms for the access, exchange,\nand/or use of the particular EHI. In such instances, the terms of the agreement need not satisfy\nthe Fees Exception (§ 171.302) or the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303), and would meet the\nmanner requested condition of the Manner Exception (§ 171.301). Using the TEFCA Manner\nException is voluntary, and in cases where a requestor would be unable to use its preferred\nexchange method it could negotiate with the actor under the manner requested condition (§\n171.301).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TEFCA Manner Exception does not require actors to use TEFCA to meet public\nhealth reporting requirements under other applicable laws. Similarly, the TEFCA Manner\nException does prohibit the use of other exchange methods. Rather, it acknowledges an\nexchange method (manner) that both the actor and requestor have voluntarily chosen to use, and\nare capable of using, as a method that would be reasonable and necessary for purposes of not\nbeing considered information blocking. As noted above, actors are still responsible for their other\nlegal obligations, such as under state law.\n\nRegarding the concern about exchanging requested EHI only via TEFCA when doing so\nwould result in the loss of some of the responsive EHI that the actor has and can (consistent with\napplicable law and patient privacy preferences) make available to the requestor for the\npurpose(s) applicable to the request, then this exception is not available to the actor. The\nfinalized TEFCA Manner Exception applies only to the EHI that the actor is actually able to\nmake available for access, exchange, or use via TEFCA and that the requestor is capable of\naccessing, exchanging, or using, as applicable, via TEFCA (§ 171.403(b)).\n\nIncentivizing TEFCA Participation\nComments. Some commenters encouraged ONC to consider that while this condition will\nbe useful for those already in TEFCA, it will not meaningfully incentivize participation in\nTEFCA. As an example, some state agencies that do not have the technological resources to\nadopt TEFCA technical services will contract with a third-party entity and end up passing the\ncost of the contracts on to others, including health care providers. Some commenters asked for a\n“safe harbor” period to allow participants to fully embrace TEFCA. A commenter expressed\nconcern that the condition will discourage third-party apps from joining TEFCA because they\nwill have more flexibility to request data outside of TEFCA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany other commenters, however, agreed that the proposal will incentivize and\naccelerate use of the available, interoperable, and secure TEFCA technical services by TEFCA\nentities. Commenters noted that the proposal would reinforce the transition to standards-based\nexchange and prevent actors from unnecessarily devoting limited time and resources to fulfilling\nburdensome, customized solutions. A commenter appreciated strong regulatory incentives to join\nTEFCA.\n\nA commenter expressed concern that the proposed condition could be used to coerce use\nof TEFCA or be used as a defense to evade fulfilling a request for access, exchange, or use of\nEHI when the requestor does not use TEFCA for a permitted purpose for data beyond USCDI\nv1. Another commenter suggested ONC use the policy exactly that way and require only the\nactor be a part of TEFCA. The commenter contended that if the requestor can receive the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI via TEFCA and is eligible to join TEFCA, the actor should only be\nrequired to offer EHI via TEFCA in order to satisfy the exception (in other words, make the\nrequestor join TEFCA to get the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. We recognize that this condition incentivizes, to\ndiffering degrees for different actors, joining TEFCA, and that not all entities will be ready,\nwilling, or able to join TEFCA as soon as the first technical services under TEFCA go “live.”\n\nHowever, we do not agree that a safe harbor period is needed, as both joining TEFCA and using\nthe exceptions are voluntary and function only to offer actors certainty that their practices that\nmeet all relevant conditions of an exception, at all relevant times, will not constitute information\nblocking.\n\nAt this time, we decline to use this exception as a means to propel requestors into joining\nTEFCA or to justify, to us or to actors, why they are not yet TEFCA entities. Such an approach is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeyond what our proposal or finalized exception is intended to achieve and may actually\nundermine and frustrate the intent of the information blocking statute and implementing\nregulations. We also recognize the concern that some actors may wish to use the exception to\nevade fulfilling a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI when the requestor does not use\nTEFCA for a permitted purpose beyond USCDI v1. Attempts to misuse the exception in that way\nwould not be successful because, for the exception to apply to an actor’s practice of making EHI\navailable only via TEFCA, the requestor must be capable via TEFCA of, as applicable,\naccessing, exchanging, or using the requested EHI from the actor. The condition in § 171.403(b),\nas finalized, addresses concerns about limits to what EHI requestors can access via TEFCA by\nensuring the condition is only available when the EHI the requestor seeks can, in practice, be\naccessed, exchanged, or used by the requestor via TEFCA.\n\nStructuring the Exception Within the Existing Regulatory Framework\nIn creating a new subpart and finalizing a separate exception, we have made it easier for\nactors and requestors to understand when an actor’s fulfillment of EHI access, exchange, or use\nonly via TEFCA would not constitute information blocking. By creating a new subpart, we are\nclearly delineating that the exception is available only to TEFCA participants. Also, by removing\nit from the Manner Exception, we avoid introducing confusion about when an actor must offer\nalternative manners and in what order they must do so. Further, in creating this new subpart, we\nleave room for identifying other reasonable and necessary activities related to TEFCA that do not\nconstitute information blocking, should we propose them in future rulemakings.\n\nEHI That Can Be Made Available Versus EHI That Must Be Made Available Via TEFCA\nComments. Some commenters stated that because TEFCA only requires the exchange of\nthe USCDI, the exception will be of limited utility. Another commenter asked for clarity that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEHI can exceed the base set of EHI required by TEFCA. Other commenters appreciated that the\ncondition would not be limited to a subset of EHI, so long as the EHI could be accessed,\nexchanged, or used by the requestor, as applicable.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. As finalized, the exception can be satisfied when\nany EHI requested by the requestor can be made available to the requestor via TEFCA for the\nrequested access, exchange, or use of the EHI, including where the EHI requested is beyond\nwhat is represented by the data elements within any USCDI version. Nothing in this exception\nrestricts how much or which EHI can be shared via TEFCA or limits the exception’s application\nto the minimum data elements that TEFCA’s terms require TEFCA entities to make available in\nresponse to TEFCA queries. If an actor is capable of sharing all the requested EHI via TEFCA,\nand, importantly, the requestor is capable of accessing, exchanging, or using all of the EHI via\nTEFCA, as applicable, then the exception could apply to the practice (if all other conditions are\nalso satisfied). Similarly, if an actor is capable of providing access, exchange, or use of some, but\nnot all, of the requested EHI via TEFCA, the exception can cover the practice for the EHI that\nthe actor is capable of providing via TEFCA and the requestor is capable of accessing,\nexchanging, or using (as applicable). The actor could then provide the remaining EHI in a\ndifferent manner, for example, by using any of the methods in the Manner Exception\n(§ 171.301), or resolve the request through other means or applicable information blocking\nexceptions.\n\nOther Concerns and Observations from Commenters\nComments. A couple of commenters stated that, in some cases, one business unit may\nsign up for TEFCA, in which case the entire organization would also become part of TEFCA.\n\nThe commenters stated that in such cases, a requestor may be unaware that they are considered a\n\n\n\n\n\n\npart of TEFCA, may not have the technical capability to connect their IT systems to the TEFCA\nnetwork, and will want to receive EHI in another manner.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for the feedback. The § 171.403(b) requestor\ncapability condition of the finalized TEFCA Manner Exception ensures that the exception is only\navailable when the requestor is capable via TEFCA of accessing, exchanging, or using, as\napplicable, the requested EHI from the actor at the time the request is made. We cannot\nanticipate every corporate arrangement; however, if a requester’s organization is a party to the\nCommon Agreement or a Framework Agreement, it is the requester’s responsibility to resolve its\napproach to EHI access, exchange, and use within the organization.\n\nAgreed Upon by the Requestor\nComments. Several commenters noted that, under the Manner Exception, a requestor\nmust agree to access, exchange, or use of EHI if the actor offers to fulfill the request in any\nalternative manner. The commenters stated that, in the proposed TEFCA manner condition,\nrequestors would not be required to agree to receive the EHI via TEFCA. They noted that this\nshifts the balance of power towards actors and away from requestors. Commenters expressed\nconcerns that the requestor cannot counter with an alternative manner and are forced to accept\nvia TEFCA. Other commenters appreciated that the condition would simplify responses for\nmany actors who participate in TEFCA and allow requestors and actors to exchange EHI more\nefficiently.\n\n*Response.* In the Manner Exception, one policy objective is to ensure the requestor\nreceives the EHI in either the manner requested or in an alternative manner to which the\nrequestor agrees. This policy assumes that the requestor would not agree to an alternative manner\nunless that manner allowed them the access, exchange, or use of EHI which they sought in the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfirst place. In finalizing the TEFCA Manner Exception, this policy objective is fulfilled by two\nconditions. The requestor has agreed to be part of TEFCA and the requester capability condition,\nwhich states that the requestor is capable, via TEFCA, of accessing, exchanging, or using, as\napplicable, the EHI requested from the actor. Although the requestor does not have to agree to\nreceive the EHI via TEFCA, the requestor did voluntarily join TEFCA, and assuming the\nrequestor has the necessary capabilities, the requestor will still be able to access, exchange,\nand/or use the EHI, as applicable. In other words, even if the requestor does not agree to a\nspecific instances of access, exchange, or use of EHI via TEFCA, the TEFCA Manner Exception\nis still available to the actor for providing such access via TEFCA, so long as an actor has\nsatisfied all of the conditions of the exception at all relevant times. We believe this approach\nbalances the policy interest of promoting interoperability and TEFCA participation with the\ninterest in ensuring EHI moves in a manner that is usable by the requestor.\n\nWe also note that the comment and similar comments assume that TEFCA participation\nwill not streamline information exchange. Those who join TEFCA are voluntarily seeking to get\nthe benefits of scalable nationwide trust and infrastructure services for IHE-based and, as the\ntransition to FHIR takes place, FHIR API exchange. Thus, those who join TEFCA would be\nmotivated to fulfill as much of their information sharing obligations and practices as they are\nable to in order to reduce the overhead associated with achieving interoperability outside of\nTEFCA. In short, rather than hampering information sharing, we believe that encouraging\nexchange via TEFCA will make it easier for both actors and requestors to achieve access,\nexchange, and use of the EHI.\n\nFinally, to clarify the distinction between the Manner Exception (§ 171.301) and its\nconditions (a) manner requested and (b) alternative manner, we have finalized a new subpart D,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Exceptions That Involve Practices Related to Actors’ Participation in The Trusted Exchange\nFramework and Common Agreement (TEFCA)” and finalized the TEFCA Manner Exception\nwithin that subpart at § 171.403.\n\nConcerns about TEFCA Policies\nComments. A commenter asked for clarification about how to distinguish exchange that\noccurs pursuant to a Framework Agreement versus an intra-QHIN agreement. The same\ncommenter also asked how actors will be able to ascertain whether a request made for a certain\npurpose (e.g., health care operations) outside the TEFCA network aligns with the same purpose\nthat they (the actors) would be offering to respond to under TEFCA; and how to handle\nsituations where a requestor does not support the capability to make or receive requests or\nperform other transmissions for certain Exchange Purposes that do not require a response (e.g.,\nPayment, Public Health, or health care operations). Another commenter asked ONC to clarify\nwhich purposes are permitted under TEFCA as applied to this exception. One commenter asked\nthat ONC clarify that if the EHI being requested or the exchange purpose for which it was\nrequested are not part of the current required parameters of TEFCA, the condition will still be\navailable.\n\n*Response.* QHIN-to-QHIN exchange would be covered by this exception because both\nparties, the QHINs, are “part of TEFCA,” having signed the Common Agreement to become a\nQHIN. Exchange within QHINs (in other words, exchange between Participants or\nSubparticipants who have joined the same QHIN) would also qualify for this exception. In\naddition, the purpose of the request is not relevant for the information blocking definition, nor is\nthe status of the parties beyond their being “part of TEFCA.” So long as the actor can respond to\nthe request via TEFCA, and the requestor participates in TEFCA and is capable of access,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use of the EHI, as applicable, then the condition can be satisfied, assuming all the\nother conditions of the exception are also met. In situations where a requestor does not support\nthe capability to make or receive requests or perform other transmissions for certain Exchange\nPurposes that do not require a response, then the TEFCA Manner Exception would not be\navailable because the requestor would not be able to access, exchange, or use the EHI if\ntransmitted via TEFCA, and thus the second condition of the exception, requestor capability\n(§ 171.403(b)) would not be met.\n\nTEFCA Directory\nONC requested comment on whether an actor should be required to search a directory\nprior to responding via TEFCA (88 FR 23873).\n\nComment. One commenter expressed concerns that the directory would be unreliable, or\nthat actors may not be recognized due to naming issues. Another commenter asked if QHINs\nwould be permitted to leverage their own provider directories.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback. At this time, for reasons such as\nthose mentioned by the commenter as well as due to the logistical complexities of providing real-\ntime access to an easily usable directory for purposes of identifying requestors of EHI, we have\nnot finalized a requirement that an actor search the TEFCA directory as a condition of the\nexception. Actors should be able to determine whether requestors are part of TEFCA through\ncustomary business interactions, such as those that occur when parties engage in exchanging\nEHI. Actors may also choose to use their own resources, such as provider directories, to make\naffirmative determinations of whether a requestor is part of TEFCA. However, it ultimately\nremains the actor’s responsibility in making a positive determination as to whether a requestor is\npart of TEFCA for the purposes of satisfying this exception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Comments\nComments. A few commenters recommended that ONC restrict the scope of the proposed\nexception such that it covers only those reasonable activities that are necessary to comply with\nand implement the Common Agreement, and not to extend it to other practices. Commenters\nnoted this would still incentivize TEFCA participation without inadvertently inhibiting\ninnovation and competition.\n\n*Response.* While we appreciate the commenter’s position and agree that such an\nexception may incentivize TEFCA participation, the finalized TEFCA Manner Exception will\nprovide certainty to actors that the practice of making EHI available for access, exchange, and\nuse via TEFCA to other TEFCA participants, and consistent with the relevant outlined\nconditions, will not be information blocking. We may consider proposing additional TEFCA\nexceptions in future rulemakings.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed support for the exception, stating that it would\nreduce burden on physicians who connect to a QHIN by allowing physicians to rely on that\nconnection as a substitute for fulfillment of tailored requests for EHI by redirecting the requestor\nto the QHIN.\n\n*Response.* We want to clarify that, as proposed and as finalized, the TEFCA Manner\nException does not permit physicians to redirect all requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI\nto a QHIN. However, TEFCA participation and meeting the exception in applicable\ncircumstances may allow physicians to redirect a significant portion of EHI requests. The\nexception outlines the specific circumstances under which an actor, who is part of TEFCA, may\nrespond to a requestor, who is also part of TEFCA, via TEFCA services regardless of the manner\nrequested, unless the requestor asked for the access via the standards adopted in 45 CFR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.215, including versions of those standards approved pursuant to 45 CFR 170.405(b)(8).\n\nFurther, the requestor must be capable of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI, as applicable\nto the circumstances, via TEFCA. Therefore, there will be circumstances when both the actor\nand requestor may be part of TEFCA, but the exception would not apply because the requestor\ncannot, for technical reasons or due to TEFCA-related agreements, access, exchange, or use the\nEHI via TEFCA. We also emphasize, again, that individuals cannot be “part of TEFCA;” thus, if\nthe requestor is an individual, the TEFCA Manner Exception will not be available to any actor.\n\nComment. A commenter suggested ONC simplify the information blocking regulations\nand create separate exceptions/conditions for providers different from those for developers and\nnetworks and explore provider-targeted exception options not tied to certified Health IT Module\nuse or TEFCA participation.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment, but we did not propose exceptions specific to any\none of the three categories of actors (health care provider, HIN/HIE, and health IT developer of\ncertified health IT), and decline to adopt such an approach in this final rule. The exceptions\naddress reasonable and necessary activities that are not considered information blocking and are\ndesigned to be used by any of the regulated actors where appropriate. Generally, they are not\ncontingent on the use of certified health IT. Further, all of the exceptions set forth in subparts B\nand C of 45 CFR part 171 are available to any actor, when they are satisfied, regardless of\nwhether the actor has chosen to become a part of the TEFCA ecosystem. Health care providers\ninterested in learning more about any or all of the information blocking exceptions can find more\ninformation about the exceptions at https://www.healthit.gov/topic/information-blocking, The\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexceptions themselves can be found in their entirety in 42 CFR part 171 (available online at:\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-171?toc=1).<sup>262</sup>\nComments Beyond the Scope of the Proposal\nComments. A commenter asked for clarification regarding the participation of entities in\nTEFCA that are acting on behalf of other entities, like business associates, and the data sharing\nrequirements for those entities.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. The regulations and requirements governing\nTEFCA are out of scope for the proposal.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter asked ONC to better explain the controls that are in place to\nensure that QHIN requested data does not violate HIPAA. Another commenter asked ONC to\naddress how patients will provide consent for the networked sharing of their data via TEFCA,\nand how patients will even be informed about what of their data has been shared by whom, to\nwhom, and for what use. A few commenters asked ONC to incorporate privacy-protective\npractices into the Common Agreement.\n\n*Response.* These comments are beyond the scope of the proposal. However, we offer the\nfollowing information in response to these comments about TEFCA. TEFCA includes strong\nprivacy protections within the Common Agreement, Qualified Health Information Network\nTechnical Framework (QTF), and standard operating procedures. Most connected entities under\nTEFCA will be HIPAA covered entities or business associates of covered entities, and thus will\nalready be required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Common Agreement requires\neach non-HIPAA entity that participates in TEFCA to protect individually identifiable\n\n\nFootnote 262:\nURLs retrieved Oct 26, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninformation that it reasonably believes is TEFCA information in substantially the same manner\nas HIPAA covered entities protect PHI, including having to comply with most provisions of the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule as if they were subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Further, in some ways,\nthe TEFCA requirements related to the Individual Access Services (IAS) exchange purpose\nrequire that IAS providers meet an even higher bar of privacy than HIPAA, including providing\nindividuals with the right to delete their data.\n\nFor additional information about TEFCA requirements related to privacy, we refer\nreaders to the most recent versions of the Common Agreement, QTF, and standard operating\nprocedures. ONC’s official website, HealthIT.gov, also provides additional information about\nTEFCA.\n\nComment. A commenter suggested ONC align with the approach taken by CMS in its\npromoting interoperability programs to explicitly name TEFCA as an optional alternative for\nclaiming credit under the HIE Objective.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. We are uncertain how or in what manner the\ncommenter recommends we align the TEFCA Manner Exception with the approach CMS\nimplemented for TEFCA participation under the promoting interoperability programs. However,\nas mentioned above, this comment is beyond the scope of the proposal.\n\nComment. One commenter requested ONC to consider how it can address patient portals\nthat cannot share a full record set with a patient, and interoperability concerns that arise from\nportal configurations.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. Although ONC does consider and regulate the\ninteroperability capabilities of health IT as it relates to patient portals through the “view,\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” certification criterion (45 CFR 170.315(e)(1)) of the\nProgram, this comment is beyond the scope of the proposal.\n\n\n",

There is no monetary cost for a user\naccount and license agreement.\n\nSummary: With the adoption and maturing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), there are\nopportunities to better support public health surveillance as well as to better support the delivery\nof relevant public health information to clinical care. Electronic Case Reporting (eCR) can\nprovide more complete and timely case data, support disease/condition monitoring, and assist in\noutbreak management and control. It can also improve bidirectional communications through the\ndelivery of public health information in the context of a patient’s condition and local disease\ntrends and by facilitating ad hoc communications, as well as reduce health care provider burden\nby automating the completion of legal reporting requirements. The purpose of this FHIR IG is to\noffer opportunities to further enable automated triggering and reporting of cases from EHRs, to\nease implementation and integration, to support the acquisition of public health investigation\nsupplemental data, and to connect public health information (e.g., guidelines) with clinical\nworkflows.

The RCTC are the first step in a two-step process to determine reportability. The\nRCTC are single factor codes that represent any event that may be reportable to any public health\nagency in the United States. A second level of evaluation still must be done against jurisdiction-\nspecific reporting regulations, to confirm whether the event is reportable and to which public\nhealth agency or agencies. The RCTC currently includes ICD 10 CM, SNOMED CT, LOINC,\nRxNorm, CVX, and CPT, representing condition-specific diagnoses, resulted lab tests names, lab\nresults, lab orders for conditions reportable upon suspicion, and medications for select\nconditions.\n\nVocabulary standards for representing electronic health information – 45 CFR 170.207\n• HL7 Standard Code Set CVX - Vaccines Administered, updates through June 15, 2022.\n\nURL: https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx\nThis is a direct access link.\n\nSummary: The CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)\ndeveloped and maintains the CVX (vaccine administered) code set.

In order to fairly evaluate whether an\ninformation collection should be approved by the OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA\nrequires that we solicit comment on the following issues:\n1. Whether the information collection is necessary and useful to carry out the proper\nfunctions of the agency.\n\n2. The accuracy of the agency’s estimate of the information collection burden.\n\n3. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and\n4.
