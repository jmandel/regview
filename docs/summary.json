This final rule implements certain provisions of the Cures Act, including\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health information technology\n(health IT) developers, the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health\nproviders, and reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking.\n\nThe final rule also implements parts of section 4006(a) of the Cures Act to support patients’\naccess to their EHI in a form convenient for patients, such as making a patient’s EHI more\nelectronically accessible through the adoption of standards and certification criteria and the\nimplementation of information blocking policies that support patient electronic access to their\nhealth information at no cost. Additionally, the final rule modifies the 2015 Edition health IT\ncertification criteria and ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) in other ways to\nadvance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.\n\nIn addition to fulfilling the Cures Act’s requirements, the final rule contributes to\nfulfilling Executive Order (EO) 13813. The President issued EO 13813 on October 12, 2017, to\npromote health care choice and competition across the United States. Section 1(c) of the EO, in\nrelevant part, states that government rules affecting the United States health care system should\nre-inject competition into health care markets by lowering barriers to entry and preventing\nabuses of market power. Section 1(c) also states that government rules should improve access to\nand the quality of information that Americans need to make informed health care decisions. For\n\n\n\n\nexample, as mentioned above, the final rule establishes application programming interface (API)\nrequirements, including for patients’ access to their health information without special effort.\n\nThe API approach also supports health care providers’ independence to choose the “provider-\nfacing” third-party services they want to use to interact with the certified API technology they\nhave acquired. In addition, the final rule provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services’\n(Secretary) interpretation of the information blocking definition as established in the Cures Act\nand the application of the information blocking provision by identifying reasonable and\nnecessary activities that would not constitute information blocking. Many of these activities\nfocus on improving patient and health care provider access to EHI and promoting competition.\n\n\n",

Throughout the years,\nwe have worked to improve the Program with a focus on ways to reduce burden, offer flexibility\nto both developers and providers, and support innovation. This approach has been consistent\nwith the principles of EO 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (February 2,\n2011), which instructs agencies to “periodically review its existing significant regulations and\ndetermine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed\nso as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving\nthe regulatory objectives.” To that end, we have historically, where feasible and appropriate,\ntaken measures to reduce burden within the Program and make the Program more effective,\nflexible, and streamlined.\n\nWe reviewed and evaluated existing regulations and identified ways to administratively\nreduce burden and implement deregulatory actions through guidance. In this final rule, we have\n\n\n\n\nfinalized new deregulatory actions that will reduce burden for health IT developers, providers,\nand other stakeholders. We have finalized five deregulatory actions in section III.B: (1) removal\nof a requirement to conduct randomized surveillance on a set percentage of certified products,\nallowing ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) more flexibility to identify the\nright approach for surveillance actions; (2) removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal\nRegulations (CFR); (3) removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor (ONC-AA) from the\nProgram; (4) removal of certain 2015 Edition certification criteria; and (5) removal of certain\nProgram requirements. We have not finalized a sixth deregulatory action we proposed, related to\nrecognition of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Software Precertification Program, as\ncomments and the early stage of development of the FDA program indicate finalization would be\npremature at this time.\n\n\n",

However, the CCDS definition also\nbegan to be used colloquially for many different purposes. As the CCDS definition’s relevance\ngrew outside of its regulatory context, it was often viewed as a ceiling to the industry’s collective\n\n\n\n\ndata set for access, exchange, and use. In addition, we noted in the NPRM that as we continue to\nmove toward value-based care, the inclusion of additional data classes beyond the CCDS would\nbe necessary. In order to advance interoperability, we proposed to remove the CCDS definition\nand its references from the 2015 Edition and replace it with the “United States Core Data for\nInteroperability1\n” (USCDI). We proposed to adopt the USCDI as a standard, naming USCDI\nVersion 1 (USCDI v1) in § 170.213 and incorporating it by reference in § 170.299. The USCDI\nstandard would establish a set of data classes and constituent data elements required to support\ninteroperability nationwide. To achieve the goals set forth in the Cures Act, we indicated that we\nintended to establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and collaborative process to expand\nthe USCDI, including providing stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the USCDI’s\nexpansion. We also noted that once the USCDI is adopted by the Secretary in regulation, health\nIT developers would be allowed to take advantage of a new proposed flexibility we called the\n“Standards Version Advancement Process” (SVAP) (see 84 FR 7497 through 7500, see also\nsection VII.B.5 of this final rule). In order to advance interoperability, we have finalized the\nadoption of the USCDI standard. Because the USCDI is adopted as a standard and the SVAP is\nfinalized, the SVAP will allow a developer to voluntarily have their products certified to newer,\nNational Coordinator approved versions of the USCDI in the future without waiting for\nrulemaking to update the version of the USCDI listed in the regulations.\n\n\n",

Certification to these 2015 Edition DS4P\ncriteria only required security tagging of Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA)\n\n\n\n\ndocuments at the document level. As noted in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62646),\ncertification to these criteria is not linked to meeting the Certified EHR Technology definition\n(CEHRT) used in CMS programs.\n\nSince the 2015 Edition final rule, the health care industry has engaged in additional field\ntesting and implementation of the DS4P standard. Stakeholders also shared with ONC—through\npublic forums, listening sessions, and correspondence—that only tagging C-CDA documents at\nthe document level did not permit providers the flexibility to address more complex use cases for\nrepresenting patient privacy preferences. Based on public comment, in this final rule, we have\nchanged the names of the two current 2015 Edition DS4P criteria to Security tags – Summary of\nCare (send) and Security tags – Summary of Care (receive). We also updated the requirements\nfor these criteria to support security tagging at the document, section, and entry levels. This\nchange better reflects the purpose of these criteria and enables adopters to support a more\ngranular approach to security tagging clinical documents for exchange.\n\nIn finalizing this more granular approach for security tagging Consolidated Clinical\nDocument Architecture (C-CDA) documents, we note that we do not specify rules or\nrequirements for the disposition of tagged data or any requirements on health care providers\nrelated to data segmentation for privacy. The use cases for which health IT certified to these\ncriteria might be implemented would be driven by other applicable Federal, State, local, or tribal\nlaw and are outside the scope of the certification criteria. We recognize that the tagging of\ndocuments is not a fully automated segmentation of the record but rather a first, technological\nstep or tool to support health IT developers implementing technology solutions for health care\nproviders to replace burdensome manual processes for tagging sensitive information.\n\nWe also proposed to adopt a new 2015 Edition certification criterion, “consent\nmanagement for APIs” in § 170.315(g)(11), to support data segmentation and consent\n\n\n\n\nmanagement through an API in accordance with the Consent Implementation Guide (IG).\n\nHowever, in response to comments, we have chosen not to finalize our proposal for this criterion\nat this time.\n\n\n",

These provisions align closely\nwith our core purpose to promote interoperability and to support care coordination, patient\nengagement, and health care quality improvement initiatives. Advancing health IT that promotes\nand supports patient care when and where it is needed continues to be a primary goal of the\nProgram. This means health IT should support patient populations, specialized care, transitions\nof care, and practice settings across the care continuum.\n\nWe have explored how we might work with the health IT industry and with specialty\norganizations to collaboratively develop and promote health IT that supports medical specialties\nand sites of service. Over time, we have taken steps to make the Program modular, more open\nand accessible to different types of health IT, and better able to advance functionality that is\ngenerally applicable to a variety of care and practice settings. We considered a wide range of\nfactors specific to the provisions in the Cures Act to support providers of health care for children.\n\nThese include: the evolution of health IT across the care continuum, the costs and benefits\nassociated with health IT, the potential regulatory burden and compliance timelines, and the need\nto help advance health IT that benefits multiple medical specialties and sites of service involved\nin the care of children. In consideration of these factors, and to advance implementation of\nsection 4001(b) of the Cures Act specific to pediatric care, we held a listening session where\n\n\n\n\nstakeholders could share their clinical knowledge and technical expertise in pediatric care and\npediatric sites of service. Through the information learned at this listening session and our\nanalysis of the health IT landscape for pediatric settings, we identified existing 2015 Edition\ncriteria, as well as new or revised 2015 Edition criteria proposed in the Proposed Rule, that could\nbenefit providers of pediatric care and pediatric settings. In this final rule, we have identified the\nalready existing 2015 Edition certification criteria and the new or revised 2015 Edition criteria\nadopted in this final rule that support the voluntary certification of health IT for pediatric care\nand pediatric settings. We also elaborate on our next steps to support pediatric care and pediatric\nsettings through the development, adoption, certification, and use of health IT, including the\ncontinued support of a pediatrics health IT webpage on www.healthit.gov/pediatrics and the\nfuture development of informational resources.\n\nWe also recognize the significance of the opioid epidemic confronting our nation and the\nimportance of helping to support the health IT needs of health care providers committed to\npreventing inappropriate access to prescription opioids and to providing safe, appropriate\ntreatment. Therefore, we requested public comment on how our existing Program requirements\nand the proposals in the Proposed Rule may support use cases related to Opioid Use Disorder\n(OUD) prevention and treatment and if there were additional areas that we should consider for\neffective implementation of health IT to help address OUD prevention and treatment.

              "text": "We have established in this final rule, certain Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements for health IT developers based on the Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements outlined in section 4002 of the Cures Act. The Program’s Conditions\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements express initial requirements for health IT\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers and their certified Health IT Module(s) as well as ongoing requirements that must be\nmet by both health IT developers and their certified Health IT Module(s) under the Program. In\nthis regard, we have implemented the Cures Act Conditions of Certification requirements with\nfurther specificity as it applies to the Program and implemented any accompanying Maintenance\nof Certification requirements as standalone requirements to ensure that the Conditions of\nCertification requirements are not only met but continually being met through the Maintenance\nof Certification requirements. In this rule, we capitalize “Conditions of Certification” and\n“Maintenance of Certification” when referring to Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements established for the Program under section 4002 of the Cures Act for ease of\nreference and to distinguish from other conditions.\n\nInformation Blocking\nSection 4002 of the Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirement under the Program, not take any action that constitutes\ninformation blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We\nhave adopted the information blocking Condition of Certification requirement in § 170.401 as\nproposed. As finalized, the Condition of Certification requirement prohibits any health IT\ndeveloper under the Program from taking any action that constitutes information blocking as\ndefined by section 3022(a) of the PHSA. We have also finalized that definition in § 171.103.\n\nAssurances\nSection 4002 of the Cures Act also requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition of\nCertification requirement under the Program, provide assurances to the Secretary that, unless for\nlegitimate purpose(s) as specified by the Secretary, the developer will not take any action that\nconstitutes information blocking as defined in section 3022(a) of the PHSA or any other action\nthat may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of EHI. We have finalized our\n\n\n\n\nproposed implementation of this provision through several Conditions of Certification and\naccompanying Maintenance of Certification requirements, which are set forth in § 170.402. We\nhave also adopted more specific Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements,\nwhich are also set forth in § 170.402, for certified health IT developers to provide assurances to\nthe Secretary that it does not take any other action that may inhibit the appropriate exchange,\naccess, and use of EHI. These requirements serve to provide further clarity under the Program as\nto how health IT developers must meet our requirements as promulgated under the Cures Act.\n\nCommunications\nThe Cures Act also requires as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement\nunder the Program that health IT developers do not prohibit or restrict communications about\ncertain aspects of the performance of health IT and the developers’ related business practices.\n\nWe have finalized (in § 170.403) provisions that permit developers to impose certain types of\nlimited prohibitions and restrictions that strike a balance between the need to promote open\ncommunication about health IT, and related developer business practices, with the need to\nprotect the legitimate business interests of health IT developers and others. The provisions\nidentify certain narrowly-defined types of communications, such as communications required by\nlaw, made to a government agency, or made to a defined category of safety organization, which\nwill receive “unqualified protection” under our Program. Under this policy, developers will be\nprohibited from imposing any prohibitions or restrictions on such protected communications.\n\nBased on public comment received, we have also finalized provisions that allow health IT\ndevelopers certified under the Program to place limitations on certain types of communications,\nincluding screenshots and video.\n\nWe have adopted Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed in § 170.403(b)\nwith modifications. A health IT developer must not impose or enforce any contractual\n\n\n\n\nrequirement that contravenes the requirements of this Condition of Certification. Furthermore, if\na health IT developer has contracts/agreements in existence that contravene the requirements of\nthis Condition of Certification, the developer must notify all affected customers, other persons,\nor entities that the prohibition or restriction within the contract/agreement will not be enforced by\nthe health IT developer. In response to comments, we have finalized in § 170.403(b)(2)(ii) that\nhealth IT developers are required to amend their contracts/agreements to remove or make void\nsuch provisions only when the contracts/agreements are next modified for other purposes and not\nwithin the proposed period of time from the effective date of this final rule.\n\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs)\nAs a Condition of Certification requirement in section 4002 of the Cures Act requires\nhealth IT developers to publish APIs that allow “health information from such technology to be\naccessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor\ntechnology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.” The Cures Act’s API Condition\nof Certification requirement also states that a developer must, through an API, “provide access to\nall data elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable\nprivacy laws.” The Cures Act’s API Condition of Certification requirement in section 4002\nincludes several key phrases and requirements for health IT developers that go beyond the\ntechnical functionality of the Health IT Modules they present for certification. This final rule\ncaptures both the technical functionality and behaviors necessary to implement the Cures Act\nAPI Condition of Certification requirement. Specifically, we have adopted new standards, new\nimplementation specifications, a new certification criterion, and have modified the Base EHR\ndefinition. In addition, we have finalized detailed Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements for health IT developers.\n\nReal World Testing\n\n\n\n\nThe Cures Act also added a new Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement\nthat health IT developers must successfully test the real world use of health IT for\ninteroperability in the type(s) of setting(s) in which such technology would be marketed. This\nprovision is critical to advancing transparency regarding Health IT Modules’ performance and to\nusers having information that could be crucial to their decisions to acquire certified health IT.\n\nAs discussed in section VII.B.5 of this final rule, we have established in § 170.405 real\nworld testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements that include Maintenance\nof Certification requirements to update Health IT Modules certified to certain certification\ncriteria (see § 170.405(b)(3) through (7) and section IV.B of this final rule preamble) to ensure\nthis certified technology meets its users’ needs for widespread and continued interoperability.\n\nAs finalized, real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements\napply to health IT developers with one or more Health IT Module(s) certified to specific\ncertification criteria focused on interoperability and data exchange that are listed in § 170.405(a),\nas discussed in section VII.B.5 of this final rule. Under these Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements, health IT developers must submit publicly available annual real\nworld testing plans as well as annual real world testing results for health IT certified to the\ncriteria identified in § 170.405(a). We have also finalized a flexibility that we have named the\nStandards Version Advancement Process (SVAP). Under this flexibility, health IT developers\nwill have the option to update their health IT that is certified to the criteria identified in §\n170.405(a) to use more advanced version(s) of the adopted standard(s) or implementation\nspecification(s) included in the criteria, provided such versions are approved by the National\nCoordinator for use in health IT certified under the Program. Similarly, we have finalized our\nproposal (84 FR 7497 through 7500) that health IT developers presenting health IT for initial\ncertification to one of the criteria listed in § 170.405(a) would have the option to certify to\n\n\n\n\nNational Coordinator-approved newer version(s) of one or more of the Secretary-adopted\nstandards or implementation specifications applicable to the criterion. All health IT developers\nvoluntarily opting to avail themselves of the SVAP flexibility must ensure that their annual real\nworld testing plans and real world testing results submissions address all the versions of all the\nstandards and implementation specifications to which each Health IT Module is certified. In\naddition, we have finalized in § 170.405(b)(8)(i) the requirement that health IT developers with\nexisting certifications to criteria listed in § 170.405(a) who wish to avail themselves of the SVAP\nflexibility must notify both their ONC-ACB and their affected customers of their plans to update\ntheir certified health IT, and the update’s anticipated impact on their existing certified health IT\nand customers, specifically including but not limited to whether, and if so for how long, the\nhealth IT developer intends to continue supporting the prior version(s)3\nof the standard(s) to\nwhich the Health IT Module has already been certified, in addition to the National Coordinator-\napproved newer version(s) included in a planned update.\n\nWe have finalized our proposal (84 FR 7501) to establish in § 170.523(p) a new PoPC for\nONC-ACBs that requires ONC-ACBs to review and confirm that each health IT developer with\none or more Health IT Module(s) certified to any one or more of the criteria listed in §\n170.405(a) submits real world testing plans and real world results on a timeframe that allows for\nthe ONC-ACB to confirm completeness of all plans and results by applicable annual due dates.\n\nThe specific annual due dates finalized in § 170.523(p) differ from those proposed as, and for the\nreasons, discussed in section VII.B.5 of this final rule preamble. Once completeness is\nconfirmed, ONC-ACBs must make the plans available to ONC and the public via the Certified\n3\nIn the near term, many of these prior versions are likely to be the same versions adopted by the Secretary and\nincorporated by reference in subpart B of 45 CFR part 170. Over time, however, we anticipate increasing frequency\nof prior versions certified including National Coordinator-approved newer versions of these Secretary-adopted\nstandards.\n\n\n\n\nHealth IT Product List (CHPL).4\nWe have also finalized, with clarifying revisions, the PoPC\nproposed in § 170.523(m) to require ONC-ACBs to aggregate and report to ONC no less than\nquarterly all updates successfully made to support National Coordinator-approved newer\nversions of Secretary-adopted standards in certified health IT pursuant to the developers having\nvoluntarily opted to avail themselves of the SVAP flexibility. We also finalize in § 170.523(t)\nthe new PoPC for ONC-ACBs that requires them to ensure that developers seeking to take\nadvantage of the SVAP flexibility provide the advance notice required in § 170.405(b)(8) to all\naffected customers and its ONC-ACB, and comply with all other applicable requirements.\n\nAttestations\nSection 4002(a) of the Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements under the Program, provide to the Secretary an\nattestation to all of the other Conditions of Certification required in section 3001(c)(5)(D) of the\nPHSA, except for the “EHR reporting criteria submission” Condition of Certification\nrequirement in § 3001(c)(5)(D)(vii). We have finalized regulation text implementing the Cures\nAct’s “attestations” Condition of Certification requirement in § 170.406. Under § 170.406 as\nfinalized by this rule, health IT developers will attest twice a year to compliance with the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements (except for the EHR reporting criteria\nsubmission requirement, which would be metrics reporting requirements separately implemented\nthrough a future rulemaking). We believe requiring attestations every six months under §\n170.406(b) will properly balance the need to support appropriate enforcement with our desire to\nlimit the burden on health IT developers. In this regard, we have also identified methods to make\n4\nAlthough real world testing plans and results will not be immediately available upon publication of this final rule,\nan overview of the CHPL is available at https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/resources/overview (last accessed 07/12/2019).\n\nFor additional information on how to navigate the CHPL, please refer to the CHPL Public User Guide.\n\n\n\n\nthe process as simple and efficient for health IT developers as possible (e.g., 30-day attestation\nwindow, web-based form submissions, and attestation alert reminders).\n\nWe have also finalized that attestations will be submitted to ONC-ACBs. We have\nfinalized a new PoPC in § 170.523(q) that an ONC-ACB must review these submissions for\ncompletion and share the health IT developers’ attestations with us. We would then make the\nattestations publicly available through the CHPL.\n\nEHR Reporting Criteria Submission\nThe Cures Act specifies that health IT developers be required, as Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements under the Program, to submit reporting criteria on\ncertified health IT in accordance with the EHR Reporting Program established under section\n3009A of the PHSA, as added by the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR Reporting\nProgram. Once we establish such program, we will undertake rulemaking to propose and\nimplement the associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health IT\ndevelopers.\n\nEnforcement\nSection 4002(a) of the Cures Act adds (in section 3001(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA) Program\nrequirements aimed at addressing health IT developers’ actions and business practices through\nthe Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, which expands the current focus\nof the Program requirements beyond the certified health IT itself. Equally important, Cures Act\nsection 4002(a) also provides that the Secretary may encourage compliance with the Conditions\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance.\n\nWe, therefore, have finalized our proposed enforcement framework for the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 to encourage consistent\ncompliance with the requirements. More specifically, we have finalized our proposed corrective\n\n\n\n\naction process in § 170.580 for ONC to review potential or known instances where a Condition\nor Maintenance of Certification requirement under the Program has not been met or is not being\nmet by a health IT developer. We have also finalized in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 our proposal to\nutilize, with minor modifications, the processes previously established for ONC direct review of\ncertified health IT in the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. Where we identify noncompliance, our first priority will be to work with the health\nIT developer to remedy the matter through a corrective action process. However, under certain\ncircumstances, ONC may ban a health IT developer from the Program and/or terminate the\ncertification of one or more of its Health IT Modules.\n\n\n",

          "text": "Section 4004 of the Cures Act added section 3022 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj–52, “the\ninformation blocking provision”). Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA defines practices that\nconstitute information blocking when engaged in by a health care provider, or a health\ninformation technology developer, exchange, or network. Section 3022(a)(3) authorizes the\nSecretary to identify, through notice and comment rulemaking, reasonable and necessary\nactivities that do not constitute information blocking for purposes of the definition set forth in\nsection 3022(a)(1).\n\nWe identify eight reasonable and necessary activities as exceptions to the information\nblocking definition, each of which does not constitute information blocking for purposes of\nsection 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA. The exceptions apply to certain activities that are likely to\ninterfere with, prevent, or materially discourage the access, exchange, or use of EHI, but that\nwould be reasonable and necessary if certain conditions are met.\n\nIn developing and finalizing the final exceptions, we were guided by three overarching\npolicy considerations. First, the exceptions are limited to certain activities that we believe are\n\n\n\n\nimportant to the successful functioning of the U.S. health care system, including promoting\npublic confidence in health IT infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI, and\nprotecting patient safety and promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to\nprovide health care services to consumers. Second, each exception is intended to address a\nsignificant risk that regulated individuals and entities (i.e., health care providers, health IT\ndevelopers of certified health IT, health information networks, and health information\nexchanges) will not engage in these reasonable and necessary activities because of potential\nuncertainty regarding whether they would be considered information blocking. Third, and last,\neach exception is intended to be tailored, through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to\nthe reasonable and necessary activities that it is designed to exempt.\n\nThe eight exceptions are set forth in section VIII.D of this final rule. The five exceptions\nfinalized in §§ 171.201-205, and discussed in section VIII.D.1.a-e of this final rule, involve not\nfulfilling requests to access, exchange, or use EHI. These exceptions are intended to prevent\nharm and protect patient safety, promote the privacy and security of EHI, excuse an actor from\nresponding to requests that are infeasible, and address activities that are reasonable and necessary\nto promote the performance of health IT. The three exceptions finalized in §§ 171.301-303, and\ndiscussed in section VIII.D.2.a-c of this final rule, involve procedures for fulfilling requests to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI. These exceptions describe when an actor’s practice of limiting the\ncontent of its response to or the manner in which it responds to a request to access, exchange, or\nuse EHI will not be considered information blocking; when an actor’s practice of charging fees,\nincluding fees that result in a reasonable profit margin, for accessing, exchanging, or using EHI\nwill not be considered information blocking; and when an actor’s practice to license\ninteroperability elements for EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used will not be considered\ninformation blocking.\n\n\n\n\nAn actor will not be subject to enforcement actions under the information blocking\nprovision for civil monetary penalties (CMP) or appropriate disincentives if the actor’s practice\nsatisfies at least one exception. In order to satisfy an exception, each relevant practice by an actor\nat all relevant times must meet all of the applicable conditions of the exception. However, failure\nto meet the conditions of an exception does not automatically mean a practice constitutes\ninformation blocking. A practice failing to meet all conditions of an exception only means that\nthe practice would not have guaranteed protection from CMPs or appropriate disincentives. The\npractice would instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to assess the specific facts and\ncircumstances (e.g., whether the practice would be considered to rise to the level of an\ninterference, and whether the actor acted with the requisite intent) to determine whether\ninformation blocking has occurred.\n\nIn addition to establishing the exceptions, we have defined and interpreted terms that are\npresent in section 3022 of the PHSA (such as the types of individuals and entities covered by the\ninformation blocking provision). We have also finalized new terms and definitions that are\nnecessary to implement the information blocking provision. We have codified the information\nblocking section in a new part of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 171.\n\n\n",

A regulatory\nimpact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically significant effects\n($100 million or more in any one year). OMB has determined that this final rule is an\n\n\n\n\neconomically significant rule as the costs associated with this final rule could be greater than\n$100 million per year. Accordingly, we have prepared an RIA that to the best of our ability\npresents the costs and benefits of this final rule.\n\nWe have estimated the potential monetary costs and benefits of this final rule for health\nIT developers, health care providers, patients, ONC-ACBs, ONC-ATLs, and the Federal\nGovernment (i.e., ONC), and have broken those costs and benefits out into the following\ncategories: (1) deregulatory actions (no associated costs); (2) updates to the 2015 Edition health\nIT certification criteria; (3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for a\nhealth IT developer; (4) oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements; and (5) information blocking.\n\nWe note that we have rounded all estimates to the nearest dollar and all estimates are\nexpressed in 2017 dollars as it is the most recent data available to address all cost and benefit\nestimates consistently. We also note that we did not have adequate data to quantify some of the\ncosts and benefits within this RIA. In those situations, we have described the non-quantified\ncosts and benefits of our provisions; however, such costs and benefits have not been accounted\nfor in the monetary cost and benefit totals below.\n\nWe estimated that the total cost for this final rule for the first year after it is finalized\n(including one-time costs), based on the cost estimates outlined above and throughout this RIA,\nwould, on average, range from $953 million to $2.6 billion with an average annual cost of $1.8\nbillion. We estimate that the total perpetual cost for this final rule (starting in year two), based on\nthe cost estimates outlined above, would, on average, range from $366 million to $1.3 billion\nwith an average annual cost of $840 million.\n\nWe estimated the total annual benefit for this final rule, based on the benefit estimates\noutlined above, would range from $1.2 billion to $5.0 billion with primary estimated annual\n\n\n\n\nbenefit of $3.1 billion.\n\n\n",

          "text": "The Secretary issued an interim final rule with request for comments on January 13,\n2010, (75 FR 2014), which adopted an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and\ncertification criteria. On March 10, 2010, we published a proposed rule (75 FR 11328) that\nproposed both a temporary and permanent certification program for the purposes of testing and\ncertifying health IT. A final rule establishing the temporary certification program was published\non June 24, 2010, (75 FR 36158), and a final rule establishing the permanent certification\nprogram was published on January 7, 2011, (76 FR 1262). We have issued multiple rulemakings\nsince these initial rulemakings to update standards, implementation specifications, certification\ncriteria, and the certification program, a history of which can be found in the October 16, 2015\nfinal rule titled, “2015 Edition Health Information (Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015\nEdition Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT Certification\nProgram Modifications” (80 FR 62602) (“2015 Edition final rule”). A final rule corrections and\nclarifications notice was published for the 2015 Edition final rule on December 11, 2015, (80 FR\n76868), to correct preamble and regulatory text errors and clarify requirements of the Common\n\n\n\n\nClinical Data Set (CCDS), the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework, and\nthe mandatory disclosures for health IT developers.\n\nThe 2015 Edition final rule established a new edition of certification criteria (“2015\nEdition health IT certification criteria” or “2015 Edition”) and a new 2015 Edition Base EHR\ndefinition. The 2015 Edition established the capabilities and specified the related standards and\nimplementation specifications that CEHRT would need to include to, at a minimum, support the\nachievement of “meaningful use” by eligible clinicians, eligible hospitals, and critical access\nhospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (EHR Incentive Programs)\n(now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability (PI) Programs)5\nwhen the 2015 Edition is\nrequired for use under these and other programs referencing the CEHRT definition. The 2015\nEdition final rule also made changes to the ONC HIT Certification Program. The final rule\nadopted a proposal to change the Program’s name to the “ONC Health IT Certification Program”\nfrom the ONC HIT Certification Program, modified the Program to make it more accessible to\nother types of health IT beyond EHR technology and for health IT that supports care and practice\nsettings beyond the ambulatory and inpatient settings, and adopted new and revised PoPC for\nONC-ACBs.\n\nAfter issuing a proposed rule on March 2, 2016, (81 FR 11056), we published a final rule\ntitled, “ONC Health IT Certification Program: Enhanced Oversight and Accountability” (81 FR\n72404) (“EOA final rule”) on October 19, 2016. The EOA final rule finalized modifications and\nnew requirements under the Program, including provisions related to our role in the Program.\n\nThe final rule created a regulatory framework for our direct review of health IT certified under\nthe Program, including, when necessary, requiring the correction of non-conformities found in\n5\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/d/2018-16766/p-4\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT certified under the Program and suspending and terminating certifications issued to\nComplete EHRs and Health IT Modules. The final rule also sets forth processes for us to\nauthorize and oversee accredited testing laboratories under the Program. In addition, it includes\nprovisions for expanded public availability of certified health IT surveillance results.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, the Secretary published a proposed rule titled, “21st\nCentury Cures\nAct: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program”\n\n(84 FR 7424) (“Proposed Rule”). The Proposed Rule proposed to implement certain\nprovisions of the Cures Act that would advance interoperability and support the access,\nexchange, and use of electronic health information and is the subject of this final rule.\n\n\n",

      "text": "*Comments.* Numerous commenters expressed support for the overall direction of the\nProposed Rule. Numerous commenters also expressed support for the policy goals expressed in\nthe Proposed Rule, including: reduced health care costs; improved public health surveillance;\nimproved care coordination, continuity of care, and shared access of data between patient and\nprovider; improved quality and patient safety; increased cost and quality transparency; greater\nefficiencies; and better health outcomes for patients. A few commenters also commended our\ninterest in ways to use health IT to address opioid use disorders. Many commenters also\nappreciated detailed context for the provisions in the Proposed Rule. Many commenters stated\nthat the proposed provisions and standards will provide opportunities for innovation as well as\nincrease the ability of health care providers to connect new tools and services to their systems.\n\nA number of commenters commended our responsiveness to the health care community,\nincluding patients, in drafting the rule. A few commenters suggested that the existing language in\nthe rule should remain mostly unchanged as ONC drafts the final rule. Many commenters\ncommended us for collaborating with public- and private-sector partners in developing the\n\n\n\n\nProposed Rule. Specifically, some commenters expressed appreciation for our work with CMS\nand their companion Interoperability and Patient Access Proposed Rule. A number of\ncommenters shared that they look forward to working with us and CMS as the health care\nindustry progresses toward an interoperable system, making it easier for small independent\npractices and providers to move to value-based care.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters. This final rule\nmaintains the direction of the Proposed Rule, and we too look forward to ongoing collaboration\nwith public and private sector partners as we implement the provisions of this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters recommended that the final rule include additional\nresources to assist with readability and ease of understanding.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. As we did with the Proposed Rule,\nwe are providing resources such as infographics, fact sheets, webinars, and other forms of\neducational materials and outreach. Many of the education materials can be found on\nwww.HealthIT.gov/curesrule.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed the opinion that the use of EHRs—and health\nIT, more generally—has negatively affected the quality of health care delivery and that the\nProposed Rule will exacerbate this issue. Some of these commenters stated that the need to input\ninformation into EHRs during office visits has resulted in clinicians spending less time\ncommunicating with patients, and some noted the impact of data entry on clinician burnout. A\nfew commenters made a similar point that use of EHRs has reduced productivity and, as a result,\nincreased health care spending.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We are aware of the challenges\nstakeholders have experienced in using EHRs and health IT more broadly. In the Cures Act,\nCongress identified the importance of easing regulatory and administrative burdens associated\n\n\n\n\nwith the use of EHRs and health IT. Specifically, through section 4001(a) of the Cures Act,\nCongress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a goal, develop a\nstrategy, and provide recommendations to reduce EHR-related burdens that affect care delivery.\n\nTo that end, on November 28, 2018, we, in partnership with CMS, released a draft\nStrategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT\nand EHRs6\nfor public comment. This draft strategy reflects input HHS received through several\nwide-reaching listening sessions, written input, and stakeholder outreach. We released the final\nreport on February 21, 2020. Reflective of public comment, the final Strategy on Reducing\nRegulatory and Administrative Burdens Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs7\ntargets\nburdens tied to regulatory and administrative requirements that HHS can directly impact through\nthe rulemaking process. The report’s strategies, recommendations, and policy shifts aim to give\nclinicians more time to focus on what matters – caring for their patients. Based on stakeholder\ninput, the final strategy outlines three overarching goals designed to reduce clinician burden: (1)\nreduce the effort and time required to record health information in EHRs for clinicians; (2)\nreduce the effort and time required to meet regulatory reporting requirements for clinicians,\nhospitals, and health care organizations; and (3) improve the functionality and intuitiveness (ease\nof use) of EHRs.\n\nIn addition to the final strategy mentioned above, we refer readers to section III of this\nfinal rule, Deregulatory Actions for Previous Rulemakings, for more information on how we\nhave worked to improve the Program with a focus on ways to reduce burden, offer flexibility to\nboth health IT developers and providers, and support innovation.\n\n6\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-\n11/Draft%20Strategy%20on%20Reducing%20Regulatory%20and%20Administrative%20Burden%20Relating.pdf\n7\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2020-02/BurdenReport_0.pdf\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments from a variety of stakeholders to extend the\n60-day comment period for the Proposed Rule, stating that due to the depth and complexity of\nthe policies proposed, it would be critical for the public to have extended time to provide\nsufficient and thoughtful comments to advance shared goals and shape the interoperability\nlandscape.\n\n*Response.* In response to stakeholder inquiries to extend the 60-day public comment\nperiod and based on the stated goals of the Proposed Rule to improve interoperability and patient\naccess to health information for the purposes of promoting competition and better care, we\nextended the comment period for the Proposed Rule for an additional 30 days which ended on\nJune 3, 2019.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters recommended delaying the final rule by issuing an\nInterim Final Rule (IFR) with comment. Commenters noted that many organizations are\nproviding comments that include new information blocking exceptions and that we will not be\nable to incorporate such suggestions into the final rule without an opportunity for comment.\n\nSeveral commenters stated that an IFR was appropriate due to the significance and breadth of the\nProposed Rule, as well the magnitude of changes proposed and that an IFR would allow for\nadditional opportunity for stakeholder comment.\n\nSeveral commenters recommended that ONC consider issuing a Supplemental Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) to seek additional comments on the information blocking\nprovisions. Some of these commenters stated that new definitions and terms introduced in the\nProposed Rule need additional clarification and an SNPRM would enable ONC to propose such\nclarifications and seek feedback on modified proposals.\n\n*Response.* We recognize the importance of allowing enough time for comment given the\nbreadth of the Proposed Rule and acknowledge the comments requesting the issuance of an IFR\n\n\n\n\nor a SNPRM. We believe that the advance posting of the Proposed Rule on the ONC website, the\ninitial 60-day comment period, and the 30-day extension, provided adequate time for comment,\nespecially given the large volume of comments received.\n\nAs discussed in the information blocking section of the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7508), after\nhearing from stakeholders and based on our findings from our 2015 Report to Congress,8\nwe\nconcluded that information blocking is a serious problem and recommended that Congress\nprohibit information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to deter these\nharmful practices. Congress responded by enacting the Cures Act on December 13, 2016, with\nmany provisions specifying a need for swift implementation. It has been three years since the\nCures Act was enacted and information blocking remains a serious concern. This final rule\nincludes provisions that will address information blocking and cannot be further delayed.\n\nWe have taken multiple actions to address some expressed concerns regarding the timing\nof the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements as well as the\ncomprehensiveness of the information blocking proposals. These actions include some burden\nreduction by removing certain certification criteria, narrowing the scope of certain certification\ncriteria, and increasing the compliance timeline with criteria. For purposes of information\nblocking, we have established compliance date for 45 CFR part 171 that is six months, rather\nthan sixty days, after the date this final rule publishes in the Federal Register. We have also\nfocused the scope of EHI, and provided new and revised exceptions that are actionable and\nreduce burden. One of these new exceptions (see § 171.301(a) and section VIII.D.2.a of this final\nrule) includes a provision by which, until 24 months after this rule is published in the Federal\nRegister, an actor’s conduct can satisfy the conditions of the Content and Manner Exception (§\n8\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf\n\n\n\n\n171.301) if they provide at least the content that is within the USCDI in response to a request for\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI. Because of these reasons and those noted above, we decline to\nissue an IFR or SNPRM. Rather, we have issued this final rule to support interoperability,\nempower patient control of their health care, and instill competition in health care markets.\n\n\n",

              "title": "2. Executive Orders 13771 and 13777",
              "text": "Since the inception of the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), we have\naimed to implement and administer the Program in the least burdensome manner that supports\nour policy goals. Through the years, we have worked to improve the Program with a focus on\nways to reduce burden, offer flexibility, and support innovation. This approach has been\nconsistent with the principles of Executive Order (EO) 13563 on Improving Regulation and\nRegulatory Review (February 2, 2011), which instructs agencies to periodically review its\nexisting significant regulations and “determine whether any such regulations should be modified,\nstreamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective\nor less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.” To that end, we have historically\ntaken measures where feasible and appropriate to reduce burden within the Program and make\nthe Program more effective, flexible, and streamlined.\n\nFor example, in the 2014 Edition final rule (77 FR 54164, Sept. 4, 2012), we revised the\ncertified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) definition to provide flexibility and create\nregulatory efficiencies by narrowing required functionality to a core set of capabilities (i.e., the\nBase EHR definition) plus the additional capabilities each eligible clinician, eligible hospital, and\ncritical access hospital needed to successfully achieve the applicable objective and measures\nunder the EHR Incentive Programs (now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability (PI)\n\n\n\n\nPrograms). ONC has also supported more efficient testing and certification methods and reduced\nregulatory burden through the adoption of a gap certification policy. As explained in the 2014\nEdition final rule (77 FR 54254) and the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62681), as modified by\nthe 2015 final rule with corrections and clarifications at 80 FR 76868, where applicable, gap\ncertification allows for the use of a previously certified health IT product’s test results for\ncertification criteria identified as unchanged. Developers have been able to use gap certification\nfor more efficient certification of their health IT when updating from the 2011 Edition to the\n2014 Edition and from the 2014 Edition to the 2015 Edition.\n\nONC introduced further means to reduce regulatory burden, increase regulatory\nflexibility, and promote innovation in the 2014 Edition Release 2 final rule (79 FR 54430)\npublished on September 11, 2014. The 2014 Edition Release 2 final rule established a set of\noptional 2014 Edition certification criteria that provided flexibility and alternative certification\npathways for health IT developers and providers based on their specific circumstances. The 2014\nEdition Release 2 final rule also simplified the Program by discontinuing the use of the\n“Complete EHR” certification concept beginning with the 2015 Edition (79 FR 54443).\n\nIn the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not “carry forward” certain 2014 Edition\ncertification criteria into the 2015 Edition, such as the “image results,” “patient list creation,” and\n“electronic medication administration record” criteria. We determined that these criteria did not\nadvance functionality or support interoperability (80 FR 62682 through 62684). We also did not\nrequire all health IT to be certified to the “meaningful use measurement” certification criteria for\n“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation” (80 FR 62604 and\n62605), which the 2014 Edition had previously required. Based on stakeholder feedback and\nProgram administration observations, we also permitted testing efficiencies for the 2015 Edition\n“automated numerator recording” and “automated measure calculation” criteria by removing the\n\n\n\n\nlive demonstration requirement of recording data and generating reports (80 FR 62703). Health\nIT developers may now self-test their Health IT Modules’ capabilities and submit the resulting\nreports to the ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratory (ONC-ATL) to verify compliance with the\n“meaningful use measurement” criterion.9\nIn order to further reduce burden for health IT\ndevelopers, in our 2015 Edition final rule, we adopted a more straightforward approach to\nprivacy and security certification requirements and clarified which requirements apply to each\ncriterion within the regulatory functional areas (80 FR 62605).\n\n\n",

          "title": "B. Deregulatory Actions",
          "text": "On January 30, 2017, the President issued EO 13771 on Reducing Regulation and\nControlling Regulatory Costs, which requires agencies to identify deregulatory actions. This\norder was followed by EO 13777, titled “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda” (February\n24, 2017). EO 13777 provides further direction on implementing regulatory reform by\nidentifying a process by which agencies must review and evaluate existing regulations and make\nrecommendations for repeal or simplification.\n\nIn order to implement these regulatory reform initiatives and policies, ONC reviewed and\nevaluated existing regulations in the year leading to the issuance of the 21st\nCentury Cures Act:\nInteroperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program Proposed\nRule (Proposed Rule) (84 FR 7424 through 7610). During our review, we sought to identify\nways to further reduce administrative burden, to implement deregulatory actions through\nguidance, and to put forth deregulatory actions in this final rule that will reduce burden for health\nIT developer, providers, and other stakeholders.\n\nPrior to publishing the Proposed Rule, on August 21, 2017, ONC issued Relied Upon\n9\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/test-method/automated-numerator-recording and https://www.healthit.gov/test-\nmethod/automated-measure-calculation\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Program Guidance.10\nHealth IT developers are permitted to use “relied upon\nsoftware”11\nto demonstrate compliance with certification criteria adopted at 45 CFR part 170,\nsubpart C. Historically, in cases where a Health IT Module is paired with multiple “relied upon\nsoftware” products for the same capability, health IT developers were required to demonstrate\ncompliance for the same certification criterion with each of those “relied upon software”\nproducts in order for the products to be listed on the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL).\n\nWith the guidance issued on August 21, 2017, health IT developers could demonstrate\ncompliance with only one “relied upon software” product for a criterion/capability. Once the\nhealth IT developer demonstrates compliance with a minimum of one “relied upon software”\nproduct, the developer can have multiple, additional “relied upon software” products for the\nsame criterion/capability listed on the CHPL (https://chpl.healthit.gov/). This approach reduces\nburden for health IT developers, ONC-ATLs, and ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-\nACBs).\n\nOn September 21, 2017, ONC announced a deregulatory action to reduce the overall\nburden for testing health IT to the 2015 Edition certification criteria.12\nONC reviewed the 2015\nEdition test procedures and changed 30 of the 2015 Edition test procedures from requiring ONC-\nATL evaluation to requiring only attestation by health IT developers that their product has\ncapabilities conformant with those specified in the associated certification criterion/criteria.13\nThis deregulatory action reduced burden and costs program-wide, while still maintaining the\nProgram’s high level of integrity and assurances. The total testing cost savings for health IT\n10\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/relieduponsoftwareguidance.pdf\n11\n“Relied upon” software is defined in the 2011 final rule establishing the permanent certification program (76 FR\n1276).\n\n12\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/healthit-certification/certification-program-updates-support-efficiency-reduce-\nburden/\n13\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/policy/selfdeclarationapproachprogramguidance17-04.pdf\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers have been estimated between $8.34 and $9.26 million. ONC-ATLs also benefitted by\nhaving more time and resources to focus on tool-based testing (for interoperability-oriented\ncriteria) and being responsive to any retesting requirements that may arise from ONC-ACB\nsurveillance activities. Health care providers and other users of certified health IT did not lose\nconfidence in the Program because health IT developers were still required to meet certification\ncriteria requirements and maintain their products’ conformance to the full scope of the associated\ncriteria, including when implemented in the field and in production use. ONC and ONC-ACBs\ncontinue to conduct surveillance activities and respond to end-user complaints.\n\n\n",

              "text": "ONC-ACBs are required under § 170.556 to conduct surveillance of certified health IT to\nensure that health IT continues to conform with and function as required by the full scope of the\ncertification requirements. Surveillance is categorized as either reactive surveillance (for\nexample, complaint-based surveillance) or randomized surveillance. Previously finalized\nregulations in § 170.556(c)(2) required ONC-ACBs to proactively surveil two percent of the\ncertificates they issue annually. As discussed in the Proposed Rule, in the time since the two\npercent randomized surveillance requirement was finalized, stakeholders had expressed concern\nthat the benefits of in-the-field, randomized surveillance may not outweigh the time commitment\n\n\n\n\nrequired by providers, particularly if no non-conformities are found (84 FR 7434). We noted in\nthe Proposed Rule that, in general, health care providers had expressed that reactive surveillance\n(e.g., surveillance based on user complaints) is a more logical and economical approach to\nsurveillance. Consistent with our September 21, 2017, exercise of enforcement discretion on\nimplementation of randomized surveillance by ONC-ACBs,14\nwe proposed in the Proposed Rule\nto eliminate certain regulatory randomized surveillance requirements (84 FR 7434).\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we specifically proposed to revise § 170.556(c) by changing the\nrequirement that ONC-ACBs must conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance to specify that\nONC-ACBs may conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance (84 FR 7434). We further\nproposed to remove § 170.556(c)(2), which specified that ONC-ACBs must conduct randomized\nsurveillance for a minimum of two percent of certified health IT products per year. We also\nproposed to remove the requirements in § 170.556(c)(5) regarding the exclusion and exhaustion\nof selected locations for randomized surveillance. Additionally, we proposed to remove the\nrequirements in § 170.556(c)(6) regarding the consecutive selection of certified health IT for\nrandomized surveillance. As noted in the Proposed Rule, without these regulatory requirements,\nONC-ACBs would still be required to perform reactive surveillance, and would be permitted to\nconduct randomized surveillance of their own accord, using the methodology identified by ONC\nwith respect to scope (§ 170.556(c)(1)), selection method (§ 170.556(c)(3)), and the number and\ntypes of locations for in-the-field surveillance (§ 170.556(c)(4)).\n\n*Comments.* A substantial number of commenters supported removing the requirements\nfor randomized surveillance. Many commenters supported the proposal to revise § 170.556(c) by\nchanging the requirement that ONC-ACBs must conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance to\n14\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/ONC_Enforcement_Discretion_Randomized_Surveillance_8-30-17.pdf\n\n\n\n\nspecify that ONC-ACBs may conduct in-the-field, randomized surveillance, including the\nremoval of § 170.556(c)(2). Commenters noted that since ONC-ACBs would still be required to\nperform reactive surveillance, and would be permitted to conduct randomized surveillance of\ntheir own accord, the regulatory requirement to conduct randomized surveillance on a specified\nportion of certified health IT would be unnecessary. Commenters supporting this proposal\npraised the deregulatory action as allowing more flexibility for ONC-ACBs. A number of\ncommenters were generally supportive of the proposal and applied the caveat that if an ONC-\nACB did voluntarily conduct randomized surveillance, they should not do so repeatedly on the\nsame Health IT Module. These commenters indicated a preference that the requirements in\n§ 170.556(c)(6) regarding the consecutive selection of certified health IT for randomized\nsurveillance remain. Several commenters were supportive of removing randomized surveillance\nrequirements and indicated they found this appropriate in view of the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification enhancements to the Program as directed by the Cures Act, while\nothers noted that reactive surveillance may be more effective in surfacing and correcting non-\nconformities. A number of commenters did not support the proposal, with many expressing\nconcerns that this could be or be perceived to be a reduction in oversight of developers or could\nreduce providers’ confidence that certified Health IT Modules would meet their needs. While a\nmajority of commenters speaking to surveillance burdens on health care providers indicated the\nremoval of mandatory randomized surveillance would, on the whole, reduce burden on health\ncare providers, several expressed concerns about whether providers can discern when a product\ndoes not meet certification requirements or know where and how to report their concerns about\ntheir certified health IT’s conformance to Program requirements. A few commenters suggested\nthat the increased emphasis on reactive surveillance (particularly in some commenters’ view\nbecause ONC is removing randomized surveillance requirements in advance of the full\n\n\n\n\nimplementation of the EHR Reporting Program called for by section 4002 of the Cures Act)\nindicates a need for additional guidance to help providers and particularly clinicians understand\nhow to recognize and report potential non-conformities in the certified health IT they use.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and reiterate our continued commitment\nto sustaining the integrity of our Program, including ensuring robust oversight of certified health\nIT products while avoiding unnecessary burdens on all program stakeholders. Having considered\nall comments received, in context of the totality of updates we proposed to the Program, we have\nconcluded that the removal of the regulatory requirements for ONC-ACBs to conduct\nrandomized surveillance is consistent with enhancing Program efficiency while maintaining its\nefficacy. We leave ONC-ACBs the option to conduct randomized surveillance as they determine\nnecessary or appropriate to support continued conformance to Program requirements by Health\nIT Modules they have certified. We also note that ONC-ACBs that choose to conduct\nrandomized surveillance will still be required to use the methodology identified by ONC with\nrespect to scope (§ 170.556(c)(1)), selection method (§ 170.556(c)(3)), and the number and types\nof locations for in-the-field surveillance (§ 170.556(c)(4)). While we appreciate concerns that\nremoval of requirements in § 170.556(c)(6) regarding the consecutive selection of certified\nhealth IT creates a potential that the same Health IT Module(s) could be selected for randomized\nsurveillance in consecutive years, we are unaware of evidence suggesting that ONC-ACBs\nchoosing to implement randomized surveillance would do so in a manner that would tend to\nerode its efficacy by over-sampling some products at the expense of under-sampling others.\n\nRather than retain a regulatory provision intended to counterbalance a regulatory requirement for\nrandomized surveillance of a required minimum percent of certified products each year, we\nbelieve it is more appropriate at this time to remove the restriction on consecutive selection of\nthe same Health IT Module(s) or location(s) for randomized surveillance and monitor the results\n\n\n\n\nof this and other Program enhancements finalized in this rule for any indication that we may\nneed to further adjust regulatory requirements in the future.\n\nWe thank commenters for bringing to our attention that health care providers may be\nuncertain about how or where they can engage the ONC Health IT Certification Program for\nassistance when the certified health IT they rely on is not performing its certified functions as\nthey expect and their health IT developer is unresponsive or fails to resolve non-conformities\nwith Program requirements. Reactive surveillance by ONC-ACBs, informed and focused by end-\nuser complaints, has always been an essential component of the Program’s oversight and\nassurance of continued conformity of certified Health IT Modules when deployed in the field.\n\nWhile we encourage users to begin seeking troubleshooting and issue resolution support from the\ndeveloper of their health IT—because the developer is often in the best position to act most\npromptly to resolve problems with their products’ performance—we also encourage the user to\nshare their concerns with the ONC-ACB that certified the health IT in question when the\ndeveloper has not addressed users’ concerns that their certified health IT is not performing as it is\ncertified to perform. As we recognize that users may in some circumstances need, or for\npurposes potentially including but not limited to their own preferences may wish, to share their\nconcerns about their certified health IT’s performance or other health IT matters directly with\nONC, we invite health IT users and all other interested parties to share their health IT-related\nfeedback or concerns with ONC through the Health IT Feedback Form on our HealthIT.gov\nwebsite.15\nDepending on the nature of a specific feedback message, we may contact the submitter\nfor additional information and, in some instances, may share the information provided with other\nappropriate entities — such as but not limited to the ONC-ACBs who certify the products about\n15\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/form/healthit-feedback-form\n\n\n\n\nwhich we receive feedback, as they are often in the best position to assess and respond to\nfeedback expressing concerns about conformance of specific certified criteria used by Health IT\nModules in production environments. All information submitted through the Health IT Feedback\nForm is carefully reviewed and helps us to improve our awareness and ability to address health\nIT-related issues and challenges. Also, we note for clarity that persons sharing health IT-related\nconcerns with ONC via the Health IT Feedback Form have the option to remain anonymous and\nthis option has been chosen by some submitters. However, we wish to note that anonymous\nsubmissions will prevent us from acquiring additional information to fully follow up on a matter\nif the submission does not include sufficient detail on which to act. In general, submitters should\nprovide as much detail as possible about the developer, product name, and version of the\ncertified health IT as well as their specific concerns about the certified health IT’s performance.\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the March 4, 2019 Proposed Rule, we also proposed to remove the 2014 Edition from\nthe Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which includes standards and functionality now\nsignificantly outmoded (84 FR 7434). We noted that removal of the 2014 Edition would make\nthe 2015 Edition the new baseline for health IT certification. The 2015 Edition, including the\nadditional certification criteria, standards, and requirements adopted in this final rule, will better\nenable interoperability and the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information, as\ndiscussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7434), and its adoption and implementation by providers\nis expected to yield the estimated costs savings described (84 FR 7563 and 7564) within the\nRegulatory Impact Analysis (section XIV) of the Proposed Rule and in the Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis section (section XIII) of this final rule.\n\nTo implement the removal of the 2014 Edition from the CFR, we proposed (84 FR 7434\nand 7435) to remove the 2014 Edition certification criteria (§ 170.314) and related standards,\n\n\n\n\nterms, and requirements from the CFR. In regard to terms, we proposed to retire the 2014\nEdition-related definitions found in § 170.102, including the “2014 Edition Base EHR,” “2014\nEdition EHR certification criteria,” and “Complete EHR, 2014 Edition.” As explained in the\n2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62719), the ability to maintain Complete EHR certification is only\npermitted with health IT certified to the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Because this concept\nwas discontinued for the 2015 Edition, we proposed (84 FR 7435) to remove § 170.545 and any\nreferences to Complete EHR from the regulation text in conjunction with the removal of the\n2014 Edition. We also proposed (84 FR 7435) to remove references to the 2014 Edition from the\nCommon Clinical Data Set (CCDS) definition and effectively replace it with a new government-\nunique standard, the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). We proposed (84 FR\n7435) to remove the standards and implementation specifications found in §§ 170.200, 170.202,\n170.204, 170.205, 170.207, 170.210, and 170.299 that are only referenced in the 2014 Edition\ncertification criteria. Adopted standards that are also referenced in the 2015 Edition would\nremain. Finally, we proposed (84 FR 7435) to remove requirements in § 170.550(f) and any other\nrequirements in subpart E, §§ 170.500 through 170.599, which are specific to the 2014 Edition\nand do not apply to the 2015 Edition.\n\nAs discussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7435), in order to avoid regulatory conflicts,\nwe took into consideration the final rule released by CMS on November 16, 2017, titled\n“Medicare Program; CY 2018 Updates to the Quality Payment Program; and Quality Payment\nProgram: Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance Policy for the Transition Year” (82 FR\n53568). This Quality Payment Program (QPP) final rule permits eligible clinicians to use EHR\ntechnology certified to either the 2014 or 2015 Edition certification criteria, or a combination of\nthe two for the CY 2018 performance period. This QPP final rule also states that the 2015\nEdition certified EHR technology (CEHRT) will be required starting with the CY 2019 QPP\n\n\n\n\nprogram year (82 FR 53671). Therefore, we proposed (84 FR 7435) the effective date of removal\nof the 2014 Edition certification criteria and related standards, terms, and requirements from the\nCFR would be the effective date of this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of the comments received supported removing the 2014\nEdition certification criteria from the Code of Federal Regulations. Commenters supporting\nthe removal noted that it will reduce confusion and acknowledges that standards and\nfunctionality in the 2014 Edition are now significantly outmoded. Some commenters\nrequested the removal be delayed until the end of CY 2019.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. We have finalized the removal of\nthe 2014 Edition from the CFR as proposed, including making the removal effective as of the\neffective date of this final rule (60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register).\n\nThe 2015 Edition was the sole edition permitted to meet the CEHRT definition beginning in\nthe CY 2019 program year. This final rule is published in CY 2020. Therefore, the removal is\nnot in conflict with CMS’ regulatory requirements for QPP.\n\nTo finalize removal of the 2014 Edition from the CFR, we have removed, effective as of\nthe effective date of this final rule, the 2014 Edition certification criteria in § 170.314. We also\nfinalized removal of terms and definitions specific to the 2014 Edition from § 170.102, including\nthe “2014 Edition Base EHR,” “2014 Edition EHR certification criteria,” and “Complete EHR,\n2014 Edition” definitions. As explained in the 2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62719), the\n“Complete EHR\" concept was discontinued for the 2015 Edition. Therefore, in conjunction with\nthe removal of the 2014 Edition, we also remove in this final rule § 170.545 and all other\nreferences to “Complete EHR\" from the regulation text. Moreover, in finalizing the removal of\nthe 2014 Edition from the CFR, we also finalize removal of the standards and implementation\nspecifications found in §§ 170.200, 170.202, 170.204, 170.205, 170.207, 170.210, and 170.299\n\n\n\n\nthat are referenced only in the 2014 Edition certification criteria. Adopted standards that are also\nreferenced in the 2015 Edition, as modified by this final rule, remain in the CFR. We also\nretained the CCDS definition in § 170.102 but removed the standards and implementation\nspecifications that reference the 2014 Edition. Additionally, we finalized the removal of\nrequirements in § 170.550(f) and any other requirements in subpart E, §§ 170.500 through\n170.599, that are specific to the 2014 Edition and do not apply to the 2015 Edition.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We proposed to remove the ONC-AA from the Program (84 FR 7435). The ONC-AA's\nrole is to accredit certification bodies for the Program and to oversee the ONC-ACBs. However,\nyears of experience and changes with the Program have led ONC to conclude that, in many\nrespects, the role of the ONC-AA to oversee ONC-ACBs is now duplicative of ONC's oversight.\n\nMore specifically, ONC's experience with administering the Principles of Proper Conduct\n(PoPC) for ONC-ACBs as well as issuing necessary regulatory changes (e.g., ONC-ACB\nsurveillance and reporting requirements in the 2015 Edition final rule) has demonstrated that\nONC on its own has the capacity to provide the appropriate oversight of ONC-ACBs. Therefore,\nwe believe removal of the ONC-AA will reduce the Program’s administrative complexity and\nburden.\n\n*Comments.* All but one commenter specifically addressing this proposal were in support\nof removing the ONC-AA. The one commenter opposed to the proposal stated concerns related\nto de-coupling accreditation to ISO/IEC 17065 standards (an internationally recognized standard\nfor bodies certifying products, processes, and services to provide assurance of compliance with\nspecified requirements such as initial testing, inspection, and quality management systems) from\nspecific assessment of a certification body’s ability to apply their accredited ISO/IEC 17065\ncapabilities to the Program’s certification scheme requirements. The commenter noted that this\n\n\n\n\nmight place a greater burden on ONC staff than did the Program structure that included an ONC-\nAA. Finally, one of the commenters in support of removing the ONC-AA from the Program\nrequested additional clarification about criteria and processes that will be used for accreditation\nof certification bodies following removal of the ONC-AA from the Program.\n\n*Response.* We thank all commenters for their thoughtful feedback. Upon consideration of\nall comments received on this proposal, we have finalized it as proposed. As noted in the\npreamble to the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7435), ONC’s experience with administering the PoPC\nfor ONC-ACBs as well as issuing necessary regulatory changes (e.g., ONC-ACB surveillance\nand reporting requirements in the 2015 Edition final rule) has demonstrated that ONC on its own\nhas the capacity to provide the appropriate oversight of ONC-ACBs. Therefore, we believe\nremoval of the ONC-AA will reduce the Program’s administrative complexity and burden while\nmaintaining its effectiveness. We anticipate providing updated information about ONC’s updated\nprocesses for approval and oversight of certification bodies through familiar mechanisms\nincluding but not necessarily limited to the HealthIT.gov website prior to the effective date of\nthis final rule, and on an ongoing basis as needed or otherwise appropriate to ensure effective\ntransparency about this aspect of the Program.\n\nTo finalize this deregulatory action, we have removed the definition for “ONC-Approved\nAccreditor or ONC-AA” from § 170.502. We also removed §§ 170.501(c), 170.503, and 170.504\nregarding requests for ONC-AA status, ONC-AA ongoing responsibilities, and reconsideration\nfor requests for ONC-AA status. Regarding correspondence and communication with ONC, we\nhave revised § 170.505 to remove specific references to the “ONC-AA” and “accreditation\norganizations requesting ONC-AA status.” We also have finalized our proposal to sunset the\npolicies reflected in the final rule titled “Permanent Certification Program for Health Information\nTechnology; Revisions to ONC-Approved Accreditor Processes” (76 FR 72636), and to remove\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.575, which established a process for addressing instances where the ONC-AA engages in\nimproper conduct or does not perform its responsibilities under the Program. Because the\nregulations promulgated in this prior final rule relate solely to the role of the ONC-AA, we have\nfinalized the removal of those requirements. Accordingly, we also revised the application process\nfor ONC-ACB status in § 170.520(a)(3) to require documentation, with an appropriate scope,\nthat confirms that the applicant has been accredited to ISO/IEC 17065 by any accreditation body\nthat is a signatory to the Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) with the International\nAccreditation Forum (IAF), in place of the ONC-AA accreditation documentation requirements.\n\nSimilarly, instead of requiring the ONC-AA to evaluate the conformance of ONC-ACBs to\nISO/IEC 17065, we revise § 170.523(a) to simply require ONC-ACBs to maintain accreditation\nin good standing to ISO/IEC 17065. This means that ONC-ACBs would need to continue to\ncomply with ISO/IEC 17065 and requirements specific to the ONC Health IT Certification\nProgram scheme.\n\n\n",

This 2015 Edition “problem list” criterion functionally remains relatively the same\nas the 2011 Edition and has exactly the same functionality as the 2014 Edition “problem list”\ncriterion. We proposed to remove this criterion because the criterion no longer supports the\n“recording” objective and measure of the CMS PI Programs as such objective and measure no\nlonger exist.16\nAdditionally, we stated the functionality is sufficiently widespread among health\n16\nBy stating in the NPRM that the objective and measure no longer exist, we meant in the CMS PI (formerly EHR\n\n\n\n\ncare providers since it has been part of certification and the Certified EHR Technology definition\nsince the 2011 Edition and has not substantively changed with the 2015 Edition. Furthermore, we\nstated in the Proposed Rule that the functionality is essential to clinical care and would be in\nEHR systems absent certification, particularly considering the limited certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed support for removing the “problem list”\ncertification criterion from the 2015 Edition and “Base EHR” definition. Several of those\nexpressing support for the removal of this criterion specifically noted that the inclusion of the\nsame data elements in the USCDI should suffice to ensure continued ability of certified health IT\nto record and facilitate access and exchange of these data. However, a few commenters\nexpressed concern that removing this and other requirements would be a disincentive to maintain\nthe functionality in the future, and some commenters expressed concern about ONC’s ability to\ncontinue to provide effective oversight and require correction if developers do not ensure the\nfunctionalities perform safely and effectively. Commenters stated that while many developers\nwill still continue to support the functionalities proposed for removal, eliminating the\ncertification requirement may allow for developers to provide a “stripped-down” product at a\nlower price point and, in absence of CEHRT definition to guide the providers, mislead\nindependent and small providers into unwittingly acquiring certified health IT that does not fully\nmeet their needs.\n\n*Response.* As discussed in the preamble to the Proposed Rule, a criterion specific to the\n“problem list” functionality was first adopted in the 2011 Edition, specifically to ensure support\nfor the associated meaningful use Stage 1 objective and the measure for recording problem list\nIncentive) Programs. The authority citation for this statement is the December 15, 2015 CMS Final Rule “Medicare\nand Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program-Stage 3 and Modifications to Meaningful Use\nin 2015 Through 2017” (80 FR 62761 and 62785).\n\n\n\n\ninformation under the CMS PI Programs. The “recording” objective and measure is no longer a\npart of the CMS PI Programs. However, the functionality remains widespread among EHR\nsystems used by health care providers. While this prevalence may be due in part to its inclusion\nin the Certified EHR Technology definition, without substantive changes, since the 2011 Edition,\nwe believe the more significant reason that this functionality is widely available is because it is\nessential to clinical care, and therefore, that the market will and should drive its continued\npresence in EHR systems regardless of certification requirements. While we also appreciate the\nconcerns of commenters about the need for health IT to support the accurate recording of\npatients’ problems and the standards-based exchange of that information, we reiterate that the\ninteroperability-focused criteria that will remain in the Base EHR definition and reference the\nUSCDI will ensure that any system of certified health IT meeting the Base EHR definition is\ncapable of using and exchanging data on a patient’s problems using content, format, and other\nstandards applicable to each mode of exchange (e.g., standardized API and C-CDA). Moreover,\nthese interoperability-focused criteria will be subject not only to the Program’s familiar initial\ncertification testing and in-the-field reactive surveillance requirements but also to the new\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements for developers to test annually their\ncertified Health IT Modules’ interoperability performance in the types of real world settings for\nwhich they are sold.\n\nAfter consideration of all comments received, and for the reasons noted in the preamble\nto the Proposed Rule and above, we have finalized the removal of the “problem list” certification\ncriterion (§ 170.315(a)(6)). We further note that upon the effective date of this final rule, the\n“problem list” certification criterion is removed from the 2015 Edition and the criterion will no\nlonger be included in the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design” criterion. This criterion, in §\n170.315(g)(3), specifies the user-centered design testing that must be applied to particular EHR\n\n\n\n\nfunctionality submitted for certification. However, in response to specific commenters’ concerns\nabout the impact of removing the functionally-based problem list criterion on our ability to take\naction where developers may retain the functionality, but fail to ensure it does not pose a danger\nto patient safety or public health, we note that our responsibility, pursuant to section 3001(b) of\nthe PHSA, includes ensuring certified health IT does not pose a risk to patient safety or public\nhealth, and is not limited to measuring the conformity of the health IT to specific certification\ncriteria. As discussed in the “ONC Health IT Certification Program: Enhanced Oversight and\nAccountability” (EOA) rule which was proposed in 81 FR 11056, and finalized in 81 FR 72404\nin 2016, ONC has the authority to address suspected or confirmed non-conformities to the\nrequirements under the ONC Health IT Certification Program if the certified health IT is causing\nor contributing to serious risks to public health or safety (81 FR 72406). The EOA final rule\nestablished in § 170.580 a regulatory framework for ONC’s direct review of health IT certified\nunder the Program, which expressly addresses the potential for ONC to initiate direct review if\nwe have a reasonable belief that certified health IT may not conform to the requirements of the\nProgram because the certified health IT may be causing or contributing to conditions that present\na serious risk to public health or safety.\n\nWith respect to health care providers’ selection of certified health IT products, we would\nencourage all providers to consider the Base EHR or Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT)\ndefinition as a useful starting point. Certain health care payment programs, including the CMS PI\nPrograms, require the use of certified health IT. CMS refers to the minimum set of required\ncertification functionalities that the health IT used by eligible clinicians must have in order to\nqualify for the CMS incentive programs as CEHRT.\n\nUsing certified health IT improves care coordination through the electronic exchange of\nclinical-care documents. It provides a baseline assurance that the technology will perform\n\n\n\n\nclinical-care and data-exchange functions in accordance with interoperability standards and user-\ncentered design.\n\n\n",

The\n“medication list” criterion that we proposed to remove does not require use of a specific\nvocabulary standard to record medications.\n\n*Comments.* Comments on the proposal to remove the “medication list” criterion were\nsomewhat mixed. While a number of comments expressed support for the removal of the\n“medication list” criterion from the 2015 Edition as duplicative of medication data included in\nthe USCDI a number of commenters expressed concerns with, and a few commenters indicated\nopposition to, the removal of the “medication list” criterion. A few commenters raised concerns\nspecific to elimination of the “medication list” criterion in view of the need to respond to the\nopioids crisis. One commenter expressed concern in the context of both the medication list and\nthe drug-formulary and preferred drug lists criteria as to whether the removal of these criteria\ncould potentially impact patients’ drug costs. Several comments also expressed the same\nconcerns for eliminating the “medication list” that were expressed in regard to removal of the\n“problem list” criterion, which are summarized above, regarding whether developers will\ncontinue to include the functionality and maintain its safe performance.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. Upon consideration of all comments\n\n\n\n\nreceived on this proposal, we have finalized the removal of the “medication list” criterion (§\n170.315(a)(7)). The “recording” objective and measure of the CMS PI Programs that the\n“medication list” criterion was originally adopted to support has since been retired from the CMS\nPrograms. However, the functionality remains widespread among EHR systems used by health\ncare providers. While this prevalence may be due in part to its inclusion in the Certified EHR\nTechnology definition since the 2011 Edition, we believe this functionality is widely available\nand used in more significant part because it is essential to clinical care and, therefore, the market\nwill and should drive its continued presence in EHR systems regardless of certification\nrequirements. While we also appreciate the concerns of commenters about the need for health IT\nto support clinicians’ ability to access, maintain, use, and exchange accurate and up-to-date\ninformation on their patients’ current medication lists and medication history, we repeat for\nclarity and emphasis that the interoperability-focused criteria that will remain in the Base EHR\ndefinition, and their inclusion of the USCDI, will ensure that any system of certified health IT\nmeeting the Base EHR definition is capable of using and exchanging data on a patient’s\nmedications using content, format, and other standards applicable to each mode of exchange\n(e.g., standardized API consistent with § 171.315(g)(10), or exchange of C-CDA documents\nusing the transport standards and other protocols in § 171.202). We recognize the critical\nimportance of providers’ and patients’ ability to have, use, and exchange medications\ninformation to avoid harms that can arise from interactions and duplications of therapeutic\neffects amongst newly prescribed drugs and those the patient may already be taking. While the\nclinical importance of maintaining and referencing current, reconciled medication lists is not\nlimited to those medications with significant risks of misuse or dependency, we agree that it is\nhighlighted by the urgent need to ensure opioids are prescribed and used only with due care\nwhen clinically necessary. We believe this clinical importance supports the expectation that the\n\n\n\n\nmarket will ensure this functionality is maintained and will drive innovations that improve its\nusability for the clinicians who use it in the course of caring for their patients. Moreover, the\ninclusion of medication information in interoperability-focused criteria in § 170.405(a) will\nensure certified health IT can access, use, and exchange medications data according to applicable\ncontent and formatting standards, which the “medication list” functionality did not ensure. This\ninteroperability of the data is critical to reducing clinician burden related to manually entering\nupdated drug lists and necessary to enable use of medication information by clinical decision\nsupport functionalities. The interoperability-focused criteria will also be subject not only to the\nProgram’s familiar initial certification testing and in-the-field reactive surveillance requirements\nbut also to the new Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements for developers to\ntest annually their certified Health IT Modules’ interoperability performance in the types of real\nworld settings for which they are marketed.\n\nWe note that once removed from the 2015 Edition, the criterion will no longer be\nincluded in the 2015 Edition “safety-enhanced design” criterion in § 170.315(g)(3). However, as\nnoted above in context of the “problem list” criterion, ONC’s responsibility, pursuant to section\n3001(b) of the PHSA, includes ensuring certified health IT does not pose a risk to patient safety\nor public health. Our responsibility for certified health IT and patient safety or public health is\nnot limited to measuring the conformity of the health IT to specific certification criteria. As\ndiscussed in the EOA rule, ONC has the authority to address suspected or confirmed non-\nconformities to the requirements under the Health IT Certification Program if the certified health\nIT is causing or contributing to serious risks to public health or safety (81 FR 72406). The EOA\nfinal rule established in § 170.580 a regulatory framework for ONC’s direct review of health IT\ncertified under the Program, which expressly addresses the potential for ONC to initiate direct\nreview if we have a reasonable belief that certified health IT may not conform to the\n\n\n\n\nrequirements of the Program because the certified health IT may be causing or contributing to\nconditions that present a serious risk to public health or safety.\n\n\n",

We\nhad previously adopted a 2015 Edition “smoking status” certification criterion that does not\nreference a standard. However, the CCDS definition, which we proposed to remove from\nregulation in favor of adopting the new USCDI standard, required smoking status to be coded in\naccordance with a standard value set of eight SNOMED CT® codes defined in § 170.207(h). As\nwith other functionality that was included in 2014 Edition, we believe this functionality is now\nwidespread. Further, smoking status data will continue to be required to be available for access\nand exchange via the USCDI.\n\n*Comments.* Comments on this proposal were mixed, with a number of commenters\nexpressing support for the removal of “smoking status” criterion in the Program and several\nnoting that it is not needed or duplicative in the context of Program requirements to support the\nUSCDI. A few commenters stated concerns that eliminating the requirement would provide a\ndisincentive for developers to maintain the function in the future. Several commenters expressing\nconcerns about removal of this criterion noted its importance to patient care and to public health,\nraising points such as the use of smoking status as a key determinant to classify cases of some\nreportable conditions, such as carbon monoxide poisoning. Concerns raised by commenters\nopposed to removing smoking status data from providers’ EHR systems included potential for\nadditional provider burden, such as that related to providing complete case reporting data and\nresponding to public health requests for additional information on patient smoking status during\n\n\n\n\ncase investigation processes.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. Upon consideration of the comments,\nwe have finalized the removal of the “smoking status” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(11)). While we\ncontinue to believe that accurate, up-to-date information on a patient’s smoking status and\nhistory has significant clinical value, we believe that its importance to clinical care provides\nadequate motivation for the market to drive ongoing availability and enhancement of this\nfunctionality over time. Because smoking status information is included in the USCDI, all\nsystems of certified health IT meeting the Base EHR definition will now be required to be able to\nexchange and use smoking status information according to applicable content and formatting\nstandards. The “smoking status” recording functionality criterion we have removed did not\nensure smoking status information was captured in a structured, interoperable manner and\ninteroperability of this data is critical to reducing clinician burden related to maintaining\ncomplete, current smoking status information. It is also necessary to enable use of smoking status\ninformation by clinical decision support and public health reporting functionalities. We believe\nthat interoperability and exchange of smoking status information through the interoperability-\nfocused certification criteria that reference the USCDI standard will better facilitate innovation\nand improvement in health IT’s ability to meet clinicians’ and patients’ needs than would\ncontinuation of the “smoking status” functionally-based recording criterion.\n\nRemoval of Specific USCDI Smoking Status Code Set\nAlong with the “smoking status” criterion, we proposed to remove the requirement to\ncode smoking status according to the eight smoking status SNOMED CT® codes referenced in\nthe value set adopted in § 170.207(h). These eight codes reflected an attempt to capture smoking\nstatus in a consistent manner. Stakeholder feedback indicated that these eight codes do not\nappropriately and accurately capture all clinically relevant patient smoking statuses.\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, we proposed to no longer require use of only the specific eight SNOMED CT®\ncodes for representing smoking status and remove the value set standard by deleting and\nreserving § 170.207(h).\n\n*Comments.* Comments specifically addressing this proposal were generally supportive of\nremoving the specific value set of eight SNOMED CT® codes, though many also noted the\nimportance of continuing to require health IT certified under the Program to retain the ability to\ninclude or access, exchange, and use appropriately standardized smoking status information.\n\nSeveral comments made specific suggestions related to broadening or revising the vocabulary\nstandard requirements for smoking status information going forward. Other commenters\nsuggested adding other forms of tobacco use, including smokeless and second hand, as well as e-\ncigarette (vaping) use.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all commenters’ input and note that no comments received\nraised concerns that are not addressed by inclusion of smoking status information in the USCDI,\nwhich all interoperability-focused criteria within the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, as\nrevised through this final rule, reference. As is the case with patient problems, medications, and\nmedication allergies, we believe having smoking status information available for standards-based\nexchange is an important facilitator of better care and more effective public health reporting with\nless data-related burden on clinicians and less need for follow-up by public health professionals\nto compensate for case reporting data that is incomplete or is not fully interoperable. As is the\ncase with the other removed criteria that were focused on internal recording capabilities, we\nbelieve the market can, will, and should be the primary driver for the ongoing maintenance and\nenhancement of functionalities for end users to record or modify these data. Furthermore, the\nProgram’s focus is more appropriately spent on ensuring that certified health IT supports\ninteroperable access, use, and exchange of these data as the key facilitator for more coordinated\n\n\n\n\npatient care and for ongoing innovation and improvement in both provider- and patient-facing\nfunctionalities. Because comments on revisions or enhancements to smoking status data\nstandardization moving forward are outside the scope of this section, we will not address them in\nspecific detail here. However, we note that the USCDI v1 references as the standard for smoking\nstatus information SNOMED CT®, U.S. Edition.17\nHaving considered all comments received on this proposal, we have finalized the removal\nof the eight-code value set standard and removed and reserved § 170.207(h).\n\n\n",

Although several commenters supported the removal of this criterion in principle, a\nnumber of comments expressed concerns about the effect of removal of the “drug-formulary and\npreferred drug list checks” and other criteria from the Program on health care providers’ ability\nto comply with CMS and State-specific regulatory requirements for successful participation in\nthe Medicare Quality Payment Program (QPP), or the Medicare or Medicaid PI Programs. One\ncommenter, noting that the Drug-Formulary and Preferred Drug List Checks criterion is\nassociated with the CMS e-prescribing objective measures that CMS has finalized for 2019 and\nsubsequent performance years specifically, recommended coordination with CMS to ensure\nalignment across the policies maintained by these two components of HHS.\n\n17\nFor more information on finalized policy regarding adoption of the USCDI standard, see section IV.B.1 of this\nfinal rule.

As discussed in the Proposed Rule (84\nFR 7437), the 2015 Edition “drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” criterion does call\nfor functionality to check drug formulary and preferred drug lists, but does not require use of any\nspecific interoperability standards. The 2015 Edition “drug-formulary and preferred drug list\nchecks” criterion does not include functionality or advance interoperability beyond what was\nrequired by the 2014 Edition “drug-formulary checks” criterion. While we believe this\nfunctionality is fairly ubiquitous now due in part to the widespread adoption of health IT\ncertified to the 2014 Edition, we do not believe it is necessary to continue to require certification\nto it under the Program in order to ensure it remains widely available. Instead, we believe,\nprescribers’ and patients’ interest in assuring patients can get the medications they need at the\nbest available value will provide adequate motivation for the market to drive ongoing availability\nand enhancement of this functionality over time, including through increasing use of relevant\ninteroperability standards essential to making this functionality more affordable and seamlessly\nreliable at scale than is feasible in the absence of interoperability driven by ubiquitous use of\nopen standards. Because the “drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” criterion we\nproposed to remove does not require use of standards or directly drive interoperability, we do not\nbelieve its continued inclusion in the Program would provide sufficient value to providers or\npatients to justify the burden on developers and providers of meeting Program compliance\nrequirements specific to this criterion. We also recognize the importance of ensuring alignment\nbetween ONC Health IT Certification Program regulations and the CMS regulations that\nreference them. We have been and will continue to work in close partnership with our CMS\ncolleagues to ensure that our regulations remain aligned, and that we provide affected\nstakeholders with the information they need to understand how the rules work together and how\nto succeed under CMS’ PI Programs using health IT certified under ONC’s Program. We,\n\n\n\n\ntherefore, permit ONC-ACBs to issue certificates for this criterion up until January 1, 2022 to\nalign with the requirements of the CMS Medicaid PI Program, as this criterion is associated with\nmeasures under the Medicaid program that will continue through 2021; after 2021 there will be\nno further incentives under the Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program (84 FR 42592).

We will\ncontinue to work in close partnership with our CMS colleagues to ensure that our regulations\nremain aligned and that we provide affected stakeholders with the information they need to\nunderstand how the rules work together and how to succeed under CMS incentive programs\nusing health IT certified under ONC’s Program. CMS has identified this criterion as supporting\nthe coordination of care through patient engagement objective and measure, which is expected to\nremain operational for Medicaid until January 1, 2022; after 2021 there will be no further\nincentives under the Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program (84 FR 42592). We,\n\n\n\n\ntherefore, will permit ONC-ACBs to issue certificates for this criterion up until January 1, 2022\nto align with the requirements of the CMS Medicaid PI Program (84 FR 42592). We have\nincluded a provision in § 170.550(m)(1) to only allow ONC-ACBs to issue certificates for this\ncriterion until January 1, 2022.\n\nLimiting certificates to this criterion for this period will help spur further innovations in\npatient engagement while helping to reduce regulatory burdens and costs for health IT\ndevelopers and health care providers. The other 2015 Edition certification criteria that support\npatient engagement, such as the 2015 Edition “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty,”\n\n“API,” and “patient health information capture” certification criteria better support\ninteroperability and innovation in patient engagement. We have seen developers integrate secure\nmessaging functionality as part of other patient engagement features, such as patient portals, and\nintegrate messaging with access to and exchange of clinical and administrative data. These\nintegrated technologies currently in use offer more comprehensive options for providers and\npatients to interact and share information via a secure platform and may render the separate\n“secure messaging” criterion and functionality redundant to robust integrated options. We also\nbelieve removing the standalone “secure messaging” criterion will encourage the market to\npursue other innovative means of offering patient engagement and interaction functionalities that\nproviders and patients want, with the convenience and efficiency they demand. Thus, we believe\nthat the removal of this criterion will help reduce burden and costs without negative impact on\ncurrent or future innovations in patient engagement and secure information exchange. In\nresponse to the concern about new market entrants being able to receive data needed to serve\ntheir customers, we note that the “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” criterion remains\navailable for patients who wish to send their health information to a third party of the patient’s\nchoice. Other remaining interoperability-focused criteria, such as “transitions of care,” ensure\n\n\n\n\nthat systems of health IT certified to at least those criteria remaining in the “Base EHR”\ndefinition will remain capable of supporting providers’ use of new entrant and other third party\nhealth IT of their choosing without requiring that health IT to integrate or interface with their\ncertified health IT.\n\n\n",

We also stated that such a “recognition” could, depending on the final\nframework of the FDA Software Precertification Pilot Program, be applicable to the\nfunctionally-based 2015 Edition “clinical” certification criteria (§ 170.315(a)). We noted in the\nProposed Rule that the proposed “recognition” could also be appropriate to address any or all of\nthe following functionally-based 2015 Edition criteria in the event their proposed removal were\nnot finalized: “problem list” (§ 170.315(a)(6)), “medication list” (§ 170.315(a)(7)), “medication\nallergy list” (§ 170.315(a)(8)), “drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks” (§\n21\nhttps://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/DigitalHealthPreCertProgram/Default.htm\n\n\n\n\n170.315(a)(10)),” and “smoking status” (§ 170.315(a)(11)).\n\nWe noted (84 FR 7439) that despite proffered benefits including alignment with both\nEOs 13563 and 13771 regarding deregulatory, less burdensome, and more effective regulatory\nschemes and programs, and serving as a regulatory relief for those health IT developers\nqualifying as small businesses under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (84 FR 7587 and 7588), there\nmay be reasons not to adopt such a “recognition” approach. We noted as examples of such\nreasons that stakeholders may not agree that the FDA Software Precertification Program\nsufficiently aligns with our Program, and that stakeholders may have operational concerns.\n\nAccordingly, we welcomed comments on these and other aspects of our proposed “recognition”\napproach, including the 2015 Edition certification criteria that should be eligible for\n“recognition.”\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters commended ONC’s efforts to recognize the\nFDA Software Precertification Program. However, most commenters expressed concerns that\nFDA’s program was not yet mature enough to assess the degree of alignment to the ONC Health\nIT Certification Program. Many commenters expressed concerns that the FDA Software\nPrecertification Pilot Program focuses on development and business practices, with a potential\nfor streamlining requirements for pre-market clearance of specific functionalities, while ONC’s\ncertification Program focuses less on development practices and more on certification of\nindividual software products as meeting Program-specified requirements for functionality and\ninteroperability, including conformance with specific interoperability standards. Many of these\ncommenters indicated that until the FDA program is more fully mature they would prefer to\nreserve judgment on how recognition could or should be structured to satisfy the needs of ONC’s\nProgram at lower burden on those developers for whom dual participation is a need or an\nappealing option. Several commenters noted potential for recognition of developers who achieve\n\n\n\n\nprecertification status under the FDA’s program to streamline or offer them a low-burden option\nfor satisfying certain requirements under ONC’s Program. However, several commenters urged\nthat obtaining FDA precertification status should not be the only way a developer could satisfy\nany requirement under ONC’s Program, noting that a developer of one or more certified Health\nIT Modules that is newer to the market or simply smaller and not engaged in development of\nsoftware subject to FDA regulation could find the FDA Software Precertification Program’s\nrequirements a higher hurdle to entering or remaining in the ONC-certified health IT market\nsector than the ONC requirements the recognition might replace.\n\n*Response.* Considering commenters’ concerns and the maturity of the FDA Software\nPrecertification Program—which remains in a pilot phase at the time this final rule is being\ndrafted—we have decided not to finalize recognition of the FDA Software Precertification\nProgram at this time. However, we anticipate continuing to consult and coordinate with our\ncolleagues at FDA and to monitor the details and experience of the FDA Software\nPrecertification Program as it continues to mature. We continue to believe that there may be\npotential for recognition of the FDA Software Precertification Program to contribute in the future\nto our ongoing goals of reducing burden and promoting innovation while maintaining or\nenhancing the assurance that the ONC Health IT Certification Program provides, but we have not\nfinalized our proposal at this time.\n\n\n",

Structured data allows health care providers to easily\nretrieve and transfer patient information, and use health IT in ways that can aid patient care. We\nproposed to update the 2015 Edition by adopting a limited set of revised and new 2015 Edition\ncertification criteria, including new standards, to support these objectives. Some of these criteria\nand standards are included in the Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) definition used for\nparticipation in HHS Programs, such as the Promoting Interoperability (PI) Programs (formerly\nthe EHR Incentive Programs), some are required to be met for participation in the ONC Health\nIT Certification Program, and some, though beneficial, are unassociated with the CEHRT\ndefinition and not required for participation in any HHS program, including the ONC Health IT\nCertification Program (Program).\n\n*Comments.* We received a few comments in support of our approach to modify the 2015\nEdition health IT certification criteria. One commenter commended ONC for proposing logical\nupdates to the 2015 Edition certification criteria, rather than overhauling the Program or\nestablishing a new edition of certification, stating iterative changes will provide stability and\nallow the industry to adapt to new market forces. Commenters stated that this incremental\napproach best serves the health care provider and health IT developer community. One\ncommenter applauded ONC for proposing logical updates to the 2015 Edition health IT\ncertification criteria and recommended that ONC continue to seek to maximize the impact of\nthese certification changes and pursue all opportunities to simplify existing criteria.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a number of commenters requested that ONC put forth a new edition and\nsuggested varied approaches to a new edition. Commenters suggested that ONC clearly delineate\nthe difference between the editions by creating a new naming convention for the updated criteria,\nsuch as a version number. Others recommended a 2020 Edition or the corresponding year in\nwhich this rule is effective. Still other commenters recommended the proposed updated 2015\nEdition be renamed to the 2021 Edition instead of renamed with a Release 2 at end of the\nexisting name. Some commenters identified the scope of the proposed changes as the reason\nONC should establish the updates as a new edition of certification criteria rather than simply\nupdating the 2015 Edition. However, the majority of commenters recommending a new edition\nbased their concern on the potential confusion among providers who purchase and use certified\nhealth IT resulting from different products available under the same label.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input on the tradeoffs associated with\nmodifying the current 2015 Edition versus creating a new edition. We considered a variety of\nfactors when we framed our proposals. First, we reviewed the scope of each proposed update and\nthe cumulative scope of the proposals overall for health IT developers and sought to identify\nwhether it would be more appropriate to require health IT developers participating in the\nProgram to implement updates to Health IT Modules certified to the 2015 Edition or to test and\ncertify health IT products to an entirely new edition of certification criteria. Second, we\nconsidered the impact that either approach would have on health care providers, including how\nsuch updated Health IT Modules or products certified to a new edition would be implemented by\nproviders participating in CMS programs.\n\nWe have considered the impact on health IT developers related to the scope of the\nindividual updates as well as the cumulative scope of all updates to the 2015 Edition adopted in\nthis final rule (see also section XIII Regulatory Impact Analysis). In this final rule, we have only\n\n\n\n\nadopted two new technical certification criteria in § 170.315(b)(10) and § 170.315(g)(10) to\nwhich health IT developers seeking to upgrade their products will need to present Health IT\nModules for certification. Unlike the new criteria introduced in prior certification edition\nrulemakings, both of these new criteria are an expansion or modification of existing criteria\nwithin the 2015 Edition which are currently in use in certified health IT. The new criteria in §\n170.315(b)(10) relates to the 2015 Edition criteria in § 170.315(b)(6) with an expansion of the\ndata and a removal of the specificity for the standard requirement. The new Standardized API\ncriteria in § 170.315(g)(10) relates to the 2015 Edition API criteria with an expansion of security\nrequirements and the addition of applicable standards. For the remainder of the updated criteria,\na developer would not be required to present a Health IT Module for certification in order to\nupdate a certified product in accordance with this final rule. Instead, a health IT developer would\nupdate their certified Health IT Module, notify the ONC-ACB that they have done so, and make\nthe update available their customers. Additionally, unlike prior certification edition rulemakings,\nthe certification criteria updated to address compliance with the USCDI do not include new\nfunctionality nor do they require a complete redesign of Health IT Modules certified to such\ncertification criteria. As noted in the Proposed Rule, the updates to the CCDS to create the\nUSCDI were intentionally limited to a modest expansion that most health IT developers already\nsupported, were already working toward, or should be capable of updating their health IT to\nsupport in a timely manner. Please see Table 1 for a list of all certification criteria changes.\n\nIn consideration of the impact our approach would have on health care providers, we\nnote that impact and potential burden for providers is of particular importance given that\nCY2019 was the first performance year where eligible clinicians (ECs), eligible hospitals, dual-\neligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in CMS programs—\nincluding the CMS Promoting Interoperability Program and the Quality Payment Program/\n\n\n\n\nMerit-based Incentive Payment System —were required to use health information technology\ncertified to the 2015 Edition to meet the requirements of the CMS CEHRT definition. If we were\nto adopt a new edition of certification criteria, CMS programs would have to consider\nestablishing a new CEHRT definition and a subsequent requirement for program participants\nwho have only recently completed a full edition update to their technology used for program\nparticipation. Historically, with a new edition of certification criteria, health IT developers have\npackaged Health IT Modules certified to new, modified, and unchanged criteria into a wholly\nnew certified product. Historical data indicates that these complete updates to the edition are\nparticularly challenging for both health IT developers seeking certification and for health care\nproviders as they place deadlines for a significant number of health IT developers to support and\nimplement new products for a significant number of health care providers simultaneously. As a\nresult, the burden of updating the technology is compounded for both health IT developers and\nhealth care providers. While ONC does not itself place any such requirements on health care\nproviders, we believe the risk of such significant burden must be considered in health IT policy\ndecisions.\n\nFurther, we believe the scope of the updates and the impact on health IT developers and\nhealth care providers must be considered in tandem—meaning that an entirely new edition\nshould only be established when the scope of the updates is significant enough to warrant the\nimpacts of implementation. When the scope of updates does not warrant implementation of an\nentirely new edition of certification criteria, we believe it is appropriate to update the existing\ncriteria. For example the 2015 Edition included new criteria that were neither built upon nor\nupdated to existing criteria in the 2014 Edition, which was significantly different than the 2011\nEdition. In contrast, health IT developers have been able to employ regular or cyclical updates\nwithout modifying all Health IT Modules certified to unchanged criteria in order to implement\n\n\n\n\nupdates to existing certification criteria such as the annual updates to CMS eCQMs or for\nchanges made to public health reporting standards. In such cases, the changes may be\nimplemented by health IT developers in the manner most appropriate for their product and their\ncustomers, such as through routine service and maintenance rather than a completely new\nimplementation.\n\nIn order to understand the impact these updates would have on participants in the CMS\nprograms which reference them for use by program participants, we compare these updates to the\ncurrent definition of CEHRT established by CMS at 42 CFR 495.4 for eligible hospitals, CAHs\nand Medicaid eligible professionals and at 42 CFR 414.1305 for eligible clinicians in MIPS. For\n2019 and subsequent years, the CMS CEHRT definition specifies the use of EHR technology\ncertified to 2015 Edition including technology that meets the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition\nin § 170.102, as well as other certified technology necessary to be a meaningful user. The\nupdates finalized in this final rule impact both certification criteria included in the Base EHR\ndefinition as well as criteria required for applicable objectives and measures. Specifically, this\nfinal rule updates several criteria currently applicable for certified Health IT Modules used by\nCMS program participants for the CMS objectives and measures necessary to be a meaningful\nuser, including:\n Revisions to the electronic prescribing criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) to reference an\nupdated e-prescribing standard;\n Revisions relating to the drug-formulary and preferred drug list checks criterion in §\n170.315(a)(10) to include at 170.550(m)(1) to only allow ONC-ACBs to issue\ncertificates for this criterion until January 1, 2022;\n Replacement of the API criterion in § 170.315(g)(8) with a new API criterion in §\n170.315(g)(10) referencing an API standard and related security standards;\n\n\n\n\n Revisions to several criteria to reference the USCDI and implement other standards\nupdates (see Table 1 for specifics); and\n Revisions to § 170.315(c)(3), to update quality reporting standards.\n\nIn general, health IT developers have 24 months from the publication date of the final\nrule to make technology certified to these updated criteria available to their customers, and\nduring this time developers may continue supporting technology certified to the prior version of\ncertification criteria for use by their customers. For providers participating in CMS programs,\nthis means they can continue to use the certified technology they have available to them to\nsupport program participation and can work with their developers to implement any updates in a\nmanner that best meets their needs.\n\nFor the revisions to electronic prescribing criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) and to the quality\nreporting standards, in § 170.315(c)(3), the updates adopted for certified health IT align\nspecifically with changes already required by CMS for use by health care providers. This means\nhealth IT developers are already implementing and supporting these updates. The\nimplementation of these updates is driven by other requirements and so repackaging such\nupdates in a new edition (or a new product) would create a redundancy and could have\nunintended cost burden on health care providers. For the updates to the criteria referencing the\nUSCDI, as noted previously, we based the USCDI on the existing CCDS with modest expansion\nthat most health IT developers already supported, were already working toward, or should be\ncapable of updating their health IT to support in a timely manner. Finally, for the removal of the\ndrug-formulary and preferred drug list checks in § 170.315(a)(10), we note that the removal from\nthe Program has negligible impact on health care providers.\n\nFirst, as discussed in past CMS regulations related to the use of these functionalities by\nparticipants in CMS programs, health care providers have noted that while formulary checks are\n\n\n\n\na promising approach, the utility of the specific functionality that is certified is not necessarily\nconsistently applicable for all prescriptions (80 FR 62833). Second, as it does not remove the\nproduct from the market, any providers who are using the current functionality may continue to\nuse the technology for their purposes. For the replacement of the API criterion in § 170.315(g)(8)\nwith a new Standardized API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) referencing an API standard and\nrelated security standards, we reiterate that health IT developers have 24 months from the date of\npublication of this final rule to update their technology and make such available to their\ncustomers. The 2015 Edition final rule adopted an API criterion in § 170.315(g)(8) which was\nimplemented by many health IT developers using the underlying standard adopted in this final\nrule for the Standardized API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10). This common use impacted our\ndecision to adopt the standard in our update to the 2015 Edition (see also section VII.B.4.c\nStandardized API for Patient and Population Services). We, therefore, believe that both the scope\nof the updates and the potential impact on health IT developers and health care providers do not\nconstitute sufficient justification for the potential burden associated with adopting an entirely\nnew edition of certification criteria. Instead, we believe it is most reasonable and effective for\nthese updates to be part of the existing 2015 Edition as modified in this final rule.\n\nWe acknowledge the concerns of commenters who expressed the potential risk of\nconfusion about the updates among their customers and how to best communicate that a product\nmeets the updated version of a given certification criterion. We strongly encourage health IT\ndevelopers to work with their customers to promote understanding of these updates. In addition,\nwe have taken several mitigating steps. First, we revisited our proposed regulatory structure and\nrevised it so that the structure more clearly reflects if a change is updating the previously adopted\nstandard, or a more significant change to the criterion such as adding a new standard. This\n\n\n\n\nmaintains the prior 2015 Edition regulatory structure for the majority of the updates except for §\n170.315(b)(10) and (g)(10) as discussed previously, and establishes a more clear sense of scope.\n\nSecond, in order to support effective communication of the updates, we are implementing\na practical approach to facilitate transparency using the Certified Health IT Product List\n(CHPL),22\nwhich is the tool that health care providers and the general public may use to identify\nthe specific certification status of a product at any given time, to explore any certification actions\nfor a product, and to obtain a CMS Certification ID for a product used when participating in\nCMS programs. While we retain the overall 2015 Edition title, we will distinguish the 2015\nEdition certification criteria from the new or revised criteria adopted in this final rule by\nreferring to the new or revised criteria as the 2015 Edition Cures Update on the CHPL for\nproducts that are certified. The CHPL will also differentiate to what standards the health IT will\nbe certified and will allow health care providers to identify if and when a specific Health IT\nModule has been updated. This will help to eliminate some of the confusion among providers\nwho are seeking to understand the certification and update the status of the product they are\ncurrently using. It can also be a resource for providers who may be making a new purchase of\ncertified health IT to make an informed decision about which products support the most up to\ndate available standards and functionality.\n\nWe further note that, while in the past ONC has largely relied on creating a new edition\nto implement changes to certification criteria, in each case, those changes included some updates\nto existing criteria, but also criteria containing functionality and standards that were entirely new\nand did not build on the prior edition. In addition, the Cures Act set in motion a shift for the\nONC Health IT Certification Program by including Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\n22\nONC Certified Health IT Product List: https://chpl.healthit.gov\n\n\n\n\nrequirements which allowed for processes such as the Standards Version Advancement Process\n(SVAP) flexibility within real world testing, which allows better alignment to industry efforts for\nstandards advancement while maintaining accountability. These new provisions help to remove\nbarriers for standards development and version updates, which limit a health IT developer’s\nability to provide individually relevant, timely, and innovative solutions to their clients. This\nchange is consistent with our approach to adopt incremental updates in this final rule rather than\nto adopt a complete new edition of certification criteria. This final rule is the first time we have\nexecuted on the concept of Maintenance of Certification requirements for existing certificates,\nand we foresee the potential for future rulemakings to include incremental updates to\ncertification criteria when such updates are appropriate.\n\nPlease see Table 1 for a list of all certification criteria changes.\n\nTable 1: 2015 Edition Cures Update\nCertification\nCriteria\nReference New/Revised/\nRemoved/\nTime-limited\nCertification\n2015 Edition\nCures Update -\nTiming\nImpact on CMS\nPromoting\nInteroperability (PI)\nPrograms\nProblem list § 170.315(a)(6) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nRemoved from 2015\nEdition Base EHR\ndefinition\nMedication list § 170.315(a)(7) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nRemoved from 2015\nEdition Base EHR\ndefinition\nMedication\nallergy list\n§ 170.315(a)(8) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nRemoved from 2015\nEdition Base EHR\ndefinition\nDrug\nFormulary and\nPreferred Drug\nList Checks\n§ 170.315(a)(10) Time-limited\nCertification\nONC-ACBs only\npermitted to issue\ncertificates for this\ncriterion until\nJanuary 1, 2022\nPI Measures:\n-e-Rx\n-Query of PDMP\nOperational for Medicaid\nuntil January 1, 2022\nSmoking status § 170.315(a)(11) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nRemoved from 2015\nEdition Base EHR\ndefinition\nPatient-specific\nEducation\nResource\n§ 170.315(a)(13) Time-limited\nCertification\nONC-ACBs only\npermitted to issue\ncertificates for this\ncriterion until\nOperational for Medicaid\nuntil January 1, 2022\nSupports Patient\nElectronic Access to\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2022 Health Information\nObjective Measure\nTransitions of\nCare\n§ 170.315(b)(1) Revised Update to\nUSCDI/C-CDA\ncompanion guide\nwithin 24 months\nafter the\npublication date of\nfinal rule\nPI Measures:\n-Support Electronic\nReferral Loops by\nSending Health\nInformation\n-Support Electronic\nReferral Loops by\nReceiving and\nIncorporating Health\nInformation\nClinical\ninformation\nreconciliation\nand\nincorporation\n§ 170.315(b)(2) Revised Update to\nUSCDI/C-CDA\ncompanion guide\nwithin 24 months\nafter the\npublication date of\nfinal rule\nPI Measures:\nSupport Electronic\nReferral Loops by\nReceiving and\nIncorporating Health\nInformation\nElectronic\nprescribing\n§ 170.315(b)(3) Revised Update standard\nwithin 24 months\nafter the\npublication of\nfinal rule\nPI Measures:\n- e-Prescribing\nCommon\nClinical Data\nSet summary\nrecord – create\n§ 170.315(b)(4) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nCommon\nClinical Data\nSet summary\nrecord –\nreceive\n§ 170.315(b)(5) Removed Effective date of\nfinal rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nData Export § 170.315(b)(6) Time-limited\nCertification\nONC-ACBs may\nonly issue\ncertificates until\n36 months after\nthe publication\ndate of the final\nrule\nRemoved from 2015\nEdition Base EHR\ndefinition effective date\nof the final rule (60 days\nafter publication)\nSecurity tags –\nsummary of\ncare—send\n§ 170.315(b)(7) Revised Document,\nsection, and entry\n(data element)\nlevel;

Agencies have the discretion to\ndecline the use of existing voluntary consensus standards if determined that such standards are\ninconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical, and instead use a government-unique\nstandard or other standard. In addition to the consideration of voluntary consensus standards, the\nOMB Circular A-119 recognizes the contributions of standardization activities that take place\noutside of the voluntary consensus standards process. Therefore, in instances where use of\nvoluntary consensus standards would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise\nimpracticable, other standards should be considered that meet the agency’s regulatory,\nprocurement or program needs, deliver favorable technical and economic outcomes, and are\nwidely utilized in the marketplace.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters stated that they do not support Federal programs’\nuse of the NTTAA voluntary consensus standards exceptions, and asked that the involved\nFederal programs continue to utilize consensus-based standards developed through work done by\norganizations such as HL7®.

                  "text": "As we noted in the Proposed Rule, the initial focus of the Program was to support the\nMedicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (76 FR 1294) now referred to as the Promoting\n\n\n\n\nInteroperability (PI) Programs. As such, the 2014 Edition certification criteria mirrored those\nfunctions specified by the CMS PI Programs objectives and measures for providers\ndemonstrating meaningful use (MU) of certified health IT. In order to improve efficiency and\nstreamline the common data within our Program’s certification criteria, we created a single\ndefinition for all the required data that could be referenced for all applicable certification criteria.\n\nWe created the term “Common MU Data Set” to encompass the common set of MU data\ntypes/elements (and associated vocabulary standards) for which certification would be required\nacross several certification criteria (77 FR 54170).\n\nThe 2015 Edition final rule modified the Program to make it open and accessible to more\ntypes of health IT, and health IT that supports various care and practice settings beyond those\nincluded in the CMS PI Programs (80 FR 62604). In comparison to the previous editions, the\n2015 Edition focused on identifying health IT components necessary to establish an\ninteroperable nationwide health information infrastructure, fostering innovation and opening new\nmarket opportunities, and allowing for more health care provider and patient choices in\nelectronic health information access and exchange. In order to align with this approach, we made\nchanges in the 2015 Edition final rule that resulted in updated vocabulary and content standards\nto improve and advance interoperability and health information exchange (80 FR 62604). The\n2015 Edition final rule further expanded accessibility and availability of data exchanged by\nupdating the definition of Base EHR in the 2015 Edition to include enhanced data export,\ntransitions of care, and application programming interface (API) capabilities, all of which\npreviously required that, at a minimum, the CCDS be available (80 FR 62602 through 62604).\n\nWe further noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7440) that the regulatory approach to\nusing and referencing a “definition” to identify electronic health information, for access,\nexchange and use, including associated vocabulary codes, has had its drawbacks. While ONC’s\n\n\n\n\n“CCDS” definition served its designed purpose (to reduce repetitive text in each of the\ncertification criteria in which it is referenced), the term CCDS, and the data set it represents, also\nbegan to be used by outside organizations such as the Argonaut Project24\nfor additional use cases\nbeyond the C-CDA and ONC’s Health IT Certification Program. As these organizations\nidentified the need to expand the content of the CCDS, the CCDS definition in regulation\nbecame a limitation to developing additional data access, exchange, and uses outside of ONC’s\nprograms. As we move towards value-based care and the inclusion of Data Classes that go\nbeyond clinical data, and as part of ONC’s continued efforts to evaluate the availability of a\nminimum baseline of Data Classes that must be commonly available for interoperable exchange,\nwe acknowledge the need to change and improve our regulatory approach to the CCDS.\n\nTherefore, in order to advance interoperability by adopting new data and vocabulary codes sets\nthat support data exchange, we proposed to remove the “Common Clinical Data Set” in §\n170.315(b)(4) and § 170.315(b)(5), and its references throughout the 2015 Edition and replace it\nwith the “United States Core Data for Interoperability” (USCDI) standard. This first version of\nUSCDI will be designated “version 1 (v1).” The USCDI standard aims to achieve the goals set\nforth in the Cures Act by specifying a common set of data classes and elements that have been\ndesigned to improve data usage and interoperable data exchange.\n\nWe proposed to adopt the USCDI v1 as a standard defined in § 170.102. Here,\n“Standard” is defined as a “technical, functional, or performance-based rule, condition,\nrequirement, or specification that stipulates instructions, fields, codes, data, materials,\ncharacteristics, or actions.” The USCDI standard would be composed of Data Classes, which\nmay be further delineated into groupings of specific Data Element(s). For example, “patient\n24\nhttps://argonautwiki.hl7.org/Main_Page\n\n\n\n\ndemographics” is a Data Class, and within that Data Class there is “patient name,” which is a\nData Element. As noted in section IV.B.1.b, for the overall structure and organization of the\nUSCDI, please consult www.healthIT.gov/USCDI.\n\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7441) that ONC intended to establish and follow a\npredictable, transparent, and collaborative process to expand the USCDI, including providing\nstakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the USCDI’s expansion. We indicated that\nonce the Secretary adopts the first version of the USCDI through rulemaking, which we\nproposed in § 170.213 in the Proposed Rule, health IT developers would be allowed to take\nadvantage of the “Standards Version Advancement Process” (SVAP) flexibility. The SVAP\n(which we proposed in § 170.405(b) and which is discussed in section VII.B.5, below) would\npermit health IT developers to voluntarily implement and use a newer version of a Secretary-\nadopted standard such as the USCDI, subject to certain conditions including a requirement that\nthe newer version is approved for use by the National Coordinator, and does not conflict with\nrequirements under other applicable law. We received a number of comments regarding these\nproposals, which are outlined in the subsections below.\n\n*Comments.* We received broad support for the adoption of version 1 of the USCDI as a\nnew standard defining critical health care data to promote interoperability. Some commenters\nfrom health plans, while supportive of patient and provider access to health care data, voiced\nconcerns about health plans being required to make data available in the USCDI standard. Other\ncommenters noted that USCDI v1 does not include data classes and elements that pertain to all\nhealth care settings, including public health, and would therefore not be broadly applicable to all\nhealth care settings.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of the adoption of USCDI v1 as a\nstandard. We wish to clarify that the adoption of version 1 of the USCDI as a standard for our\n\n\n\n\nProgram is not specific to a setting of care, a health care specialty, or a specific category of\nhealth IT user. Nor is the USCDI specific to a particular content exchange standard (e.g., HL7 C-\nCDA, HL7 FHIR, HL7 V2, and NCPDP SCRIPT). Rather, it applies to the certification of health\nIT and certified health IT’s ability to send and receive the Data Elements defined by USCDI\nwithout requirements regarding functionality, user interface, or the use of those Data Elements in\nexchange. While some users may find few opportunities to exchange these Data Elements, many\nwill exchange these Data Elements frequently, and we believe that all health care providers\nshould have certified health IT that can provide them with a means to appropriately share and\naccess the USCDI data set when exchanging data with other providers. Accordingly, we seek to\nclarify a point with respect to our proposal regarding the USCDI and health IT certification. For\nthe purposes of the ONC Health IT Certification Program, specific certification criteria are the\nway the USCDI comes into effect. For example, the USCDI is referenced as part of the data\nrequirements in the updated “transitions of care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)), which\nalso specifies that for certification to that criterion, the C-CDA must be used as the syntax to\nhold all of the USCDI data.\n\nAs we explained, we believe that the adoption of USCDI v1 for all certified health IT will\nadvance interoperability by ensuring utilization of common data and vocabulary code sets, and\nthat standardization will support both electronic exchange and usability of the data. Furthermore,\nbecause ONC will establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and collaborative process to\nexpand future versions of USCDI, including providing stakeholders with the opportunity to\ncomment on draft USCDI’s expansion, stakeholders will have ample opportunities to advance\nadditional Data Classes and Data Elements relevant to a wide range of health care use cases.\n\nAfter consideration of these comments and the overall support of commenters, we have adopted\nthe USCDI v1 as a standard in § 170.213.\n\n\n\n\nWe have also extended the compliance timelines with which a health IT developer needs\nto update to the USCDI, therefore, we have not removed the CCDS definition from § 170.102 as\nproposed but revised it to remove references to 2014 Edition standards and provided time\nlimitations for when health IT developers need to update to the USCDI.\n\n\n",

Once adopted\nin this final rule, health IT developers would be required to update their certified health IT to\nsupport the USCDI v1 for all certification criteria affected by this proposed change. We also\nproposed conforming changes in the sections below to update the following formerly CCDS-\ndependent 2015 Edition certification criteria to incorporate the USCDI standard:\n “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));\n “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” (§ 170.315(e)(1));\n “transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting” (§ 170.315(f)(5));\n “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6)); and\n “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9)).\n\nWe did not include the “data export” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(6)) in the proposed list of\ncriteria that would be revised to include the USCDI standard because we proposed to remove the\n“data export” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(6)) and instead proposed to adopt a criterion that we\n25\nWe note that USCDI v1 is an updated version and distinguished from the Draft United States Core Data for\nInteroperability (USCDI) previously made available for public review and comment in the course of its development\nas a prospective standard. The data classes and elements in the USCDI v1 were proposed in § 170.213 and defined\nin the Proposed Rule, and an additional USCDI v1 document with technical standards information was posted\nelectronically concurrent with the publication of the Proposed Rule in order to provide the public adequate time to\nfully review and comment on both the proposed regulation and the USCDI v1 technical information.\n\n\n\n\nreferenced as “EHI export” in the Proposed Rule (§ 170.315(b)(10)). For similar reasons, we did\nnot include the “application access – data category request” criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)) because\nwe proposed to replace it with the API certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) that derives its\ndata requirements from the USCDI.\n\nWe also proposed, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement (§ 170.405(b)(3)) for\nthe real world testing Condition of Certification requirement (§ 170.405(a)), that health IT\ndevelopers with health IT certified to the five above-identified certification criteria prior to the\neffective date of this final rule would have to update such certified health IT to the proposed\nrevised standards (84 FR 7441 and 7596). We further proposed, as a Maintenance of\nCertification requirement (§ 170.405(b)(3)) for the real world testing Condition of Certification\nrequirement (§ 170.405(a)), that health IT developers must provide the updated certified health\nIT to all their customers with health IT previously certified to the identified criteria no later than\n24 months after the effective date of this final rule (84 FR 7441 and 84 FR 7596). For the\npurposes of meeting this compliance timeline, we noted that we expected health IT developers to\nupdate their certified health IT and notify their ONC-ACB on the date at which they have\nreached compliance. We noted that developers would also need to factor these updates into their\nnext real world testing plan as discussed in section VII.B.5 of the Proposed Rule.26\nComments. The majority of commenters supported the proposed adoption of USCDI v1\nand incorporation of the USCDI into the revised and new certification criteria. Some commenters\nexpressed concern that incorporation of the USCDI into the “transmission to public health\nagencies – electronic case reporting” certification criteria could have a negative impact on data\nreceived by public health reporting programs. Some commenters stressed the need for reasonable\n26\nThe finalized real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements are discussed in section\nVII.B.5 of this final rule.\n\n\n\n\nadoption timelines. Some suggested a longer adoption and implementation timeline for\nincorporation of the USCDI as part of certified health IT.\n\n*Response.* ONC acknowledges that some entities, such as public health agencies, may\nneed to consider what the expanded set of data the USCDI v1 offers may mean to their reporting\nprograms and requirements. To be clear, the USCDI’s existence as a stand-alone standard will\nnot impact or change public health reporting requirements. However, certain data now included\nin the USCDI, such as clinical notes, would now become more readily available for public health\nreporting and a State’s public health program’s policy may need to be revisited if a State seeks to\nmake use of the “new” data the adoption of the USCDI stands to make more easily available, and\nmore usable upon receipt. We also believe that the proposed 24-month timeline for updating\ncertified health IT to comply with the new USCDI standard in § 170.213 is an adequate\nimplementation timeline, based on other adoption timelines with similar technical complexities.\n\nWe, therefore, have finalized revisions for the five above-identified formerly CCDS-dependent\n2015 Edition certification criteria to incorporate the USCDI standard.\n\nWe have finalized a modification to the regulation text for these criteria based on public\ncomment related to mitigating the risk of potential confusion caused by updates to existing\ncriteria. As discussed earlier in this preamble (section IV), we received public comment\nrequesting that all revised criteria be included in a new edition of certification criteria. At the\nstart of section IV, we discuss in response to these comments that we do not believe the creation\nof a new edition is appropriate given that the scope of the updates to the 2015 Edition is tied to\nstandards updates required to keep pace with current industry practices. However, we do plan to\ndistinguish the 2015 Edition certification criteria from the updated criteria in this final rule by\nreferring to them as the 2015 Edition Cures Update on the CHPL.\n\nHowever, as Health IT Modules are updated to the new standards over time, there is a\n\n\n\n\nneed to define what is required for certification and what is required for compliance to prior\ncertification. Therefore, we have finalized that for criteria being updated from the CCDS to the\nUSCDI, 24 months after publication date of the final rule shall be applicable for a transition from\nthe CCDS to the USCDI. We have finalized that for the period until 24 months after the\npublication date of the final rule, the CCDS remains applicable for certified Health IT Modules\nuntil such Health IT Modules are updated to the USCDI. This means that upon the effective date\nof the rule, for the identified criteria the following apply for certification and compliance:\n The USCDI, or\n The CCDS for the period up to 24 months after the publication date of the final\nrule.\n\nThis allows for developers to plan the transition for their products more effectively and\nsupports certification continuity. We have finalized a modification to the regulation text to\nrequire the USCDI, or the CCDS for the period lasting until 24 months after the publication date\nof the final rule.\n\nWe have finalized this modification to the regulation text for the following criteria:\n “transitions of care” (§ 170.315(b)(1));\n “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” (§ 170.315(e)(1));\n “transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting” (§ 170.315(f)(5));\n “consolidated CDA creation performance” (§ 170.315(g)(6)); and\n “application access – all data request” (§ 170.315(g)(9))\nWe have finalized in § 170.405(b)(3), as a Maintenance of Certification requirement\nunder the real world testing Condition of Certification requirement, that health IT developers\nwith health IT certified to the five above-identified certification criteria prior to the effective date\n\n\n\n\nof this final rule, would have to update such certified health IT to the revisions within 24 months\nof the publication date of this rule.\n\nAs of this final rule’s effective date, the “data export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(6) is no\nlonger required as a part of the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. ONC-ACB’s will not be\npermitted to issue certificates to this certification criteria after 36 months after the publication\ndate of this final rule. As discussed in the “EHI export” section below, we have retained §\n170.315(b)(6) “as is,” without updates to the USCDI. Thus, health IT developers with health IT\ncertified to the prior certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(6) do not have to update such certified\nhealth IT to the revisions listed above, but are permitted to maintain or seek new Health IT\nModule certification to this criterion should they desire this functionality.\n\n\n",

The\nstandard we proposed to adopt in § 170.213 also reflected and acknowledged the burden that\nrapidly expanding the USCDI v1 beyond the CCDS could cause. As a result, the USCDI v1 that\nwe proposed was a modest expansion of the CCDS, which we indicated that most health IT\ndevelopers already supported, were already working toward, or should be capable of updating\ntheir health IT to support in a timely manner. Therefore, in our Proposed Rule, we outlined only\n27\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-uscdi.pdf (January 5, 2018).\n\n\n\n\nthe delta between the CCDS and the USCDI v1.

In\nthe interests of maintaining our proposed implementation timeline of 24 months from the\npublication of this final rule, and after consideration of these comments and the overall support\nof commenters, we have finalized the adoption of the Data Classes and elements of the USCDI\nstandard as proposed, with changes outlined in the subsections below. Additionally, in order to\naddress the error pointed out to us via comments in the Procedures Data Class, as was stated in\nthe draft USCDI v1,28\nwe clarified that the American Dental Association’s Code on Dental\nProcedures and Nomenclature (CDT) should be used for Dental Procedures in the USCDI v1, not\nSNODENT as was erroneously stated in the draft USCDI v1.\n\n28\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-uscdi.pdf\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to the USCDI’s expansion in future years, ONC will establish and follow a\npredictable, transparent, and collaborative process to expand the USCDI, which will provide\nstakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the USCDI’s expansion and to advance\nadditional Data Classes and Data Elements relevant to a wide range of use cases related to health\ncare. Prior to this final rule, we published our initial thinking as well as examples of Data Classes\nand Data Elements that we believed could be appropriate to propose for adding to the USCDI.29\nWe have also solicited feedback and recommendations from the HITAC. As we evaluated public\ncomments and conducted our own research prior to the issuance of this final rule, we also wanted\nto identify for stakeholders another potential source that could be used to focus efforts around\nnew USCDI Data Classes and Data Elements. As is noted throughout this rule, the HL7®\nFHIR® standard represents health information in what are called “FHIR resources.” When it\ncomes to logically organizing FHIR resources that relate to one another and share common\nproperties, FHIR uses a concept called a “compartment.” Through the standards development\nprocess a “Patient Compartment” has been created, which lists all of the FHIR resources that are\nassociated with a patient. The Patient Compartment “includes any resources where the subject of\nthe resource is the patient, and some other resources that are directly linked to resources in the\npatient compartment.” This organizing framework provides a potentially rich set of a Data\nClasses and Data Elements to consider for inclusion in the USCDI, including clinical, encounter,\nspecialty, and financial data. As ONC looks to make its own investments to advance the\nimplementation experience associated with prospective USCDI Data Classes and Data Elements,\nwe intend to leverage the Patient Compartment to guide our thinking. In addition, we will also\nlook to and encourage industry to look at other organizing frameworks such as the Clinical\n29\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/draft-uscdi.pdf\n\n\n\n\nQuality/Clinical Decision Support realms and the payer-to-provider community (e.g., DaVinci\nProject30\n) to help identify data that would be best to focus on for USCDI expansion.\n\n\n",

We further noted that the inclusion\nof these Data Elements was consistent with the list of patient matching Data Elements already\nspecified in the 2015 Edition “transitions of care” certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)),\n31\n77 FR 54163, 54268-69 (September 4, 2012).\n\n\n\n\nwhich supports the exchange of patient health information between providers of patient care.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters unanimously supported the addition of address and phone\nnumbers to the USCDI v1. The majority of commenters on this proposal recommended the use\nof the U.S. Postal Service address format to improve address data quality. Commenters also\nrecommended additional elements of address and phone number indicating effective period (e.g.,\ncurrent address, former address); use (e.g., mobile phone number, landline, etc.), and email\naddress.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their recommendations and agree that these\nadditional Data Elements can be useful to provide better care and assist with patient matching. In\nconsideration of these comments, we have finalized the addition of the following Data Elements\nwithin the Patient Demographics Data Class:\n “current address”;\n “previous address”;\n “phone number”;\n “phone number type”; and\n “email address.”\n\nWe further clarify that “phone number” and “phone number type” must be represented\nusing the same standards, ITU-T E.123 (02/2001) and ITU-T E.164, as already adopted for this\ndata in 45 CFR 170.207(q) and referenced in the 2015 Edition “transitions of care” certification\ncriterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(G)).\n\nWe appreciate commenters’ recommendations to use the U.S. Postal Service Postal\nAddressing Standards, which include address formatting guidance and a variety of products to\nimprove address quality, such as address element standardization and validation which are\n\n\n\n\npublished and available for public use.32\nThe U.S. Postal Service Postal Addressing Standards\ninclude standardized names for common unit identifiers, line by line acceptance requirements for\nmail services, and overall address format guidance that has been specifically designed to support\nlabelling of mail items for acceptance by the U.S. Postal Service automated sorting processes.\n\nWe acknowledge the potential for its use within health IT to improve patient matching. However,\nwhile the U.S. Postal Service Postal Addressing Standards include a single representation for\ncertain data elements (such as rendering apartment as apt, building as bldg, floor as fl, etc.) they\nalso allow variations for other data elements, such as “acceptable” and “preferred” spellings and\nabbreviations for street and city names. This may result in multiple “valid” addresses. To\nreconcile this variation, the U.S. Postal Service provides a file listing preferred city and State\ncombinations as well as a file of street name and zip code combinations and the resulting\naggregated address would then require manual reconciliation. We believe the U.S. Postal Service\nPostal Addressing Standards may be useful guidance for health IT developers. However, because\nof the variation, the required use of reference files, and the manual reconciliation necessary for\nimplementation, we have not adopted the U.S. Postal Service Postal Addressing Standards as a\nrequired standard for the address Data Elements within the USCDI. We encourage the use of\nstandardized elements to accurately represent patient address including use of standardized\nreferences in the U.S Post Service Postal Addressing Standards where applicable. In addition, we\nwill continue to work with standards developing organizations to evaluate potential solutions to\nimprove patient matching, including considering the potential adaptability of the U.S. Postal\nService formats for health IT use cases.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service also maintains web based tools for address validation services\n32\nU.S. Postal Service: Postal Addressing Standards (Publication 28) available at\nhttps://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm\n\n\n\n\nand provides implementation guidance to integrate these tools into technical workflows for IT\nsystems in e-commerce and other industries. We agree that these address validation tools have\nthe potential to greatly improve address data quality, and we encourage health IT developers and\nother relevant health IT users such as health information networks to explore mechanisms by\nwhich such address validation might support patient matching. While not specifically designed\nfor patient matching and other health care related applications, USPS address validation has been\npiloted in these settings. To adapt the address validation tool to a health care purpose requires the\nservices of a third party with licensing of the tool and the development of a bespoke process to\nexecute the tool. The aggregated patient address could then be compared against the USPS\naddress on file and the patient data could be amended where inaccurate, appended where\nincomplete, or a linked record of secondary address data could be created depending on the\npercent of confidence in the specific match. This process would then require manual\nreconciliation. The results of these pilots indicate significant complexity and burden associated\nwith implementation of this process. Given these burdens, we believe it would not be appropriate\nto require the integration of this distinct functionality into certified health IT at this time. We\nagain encourage the further development and use of standardized approaches for address\nvalidation and will continue to monitor and analyze such efforts for consideration in future\nrulemaking.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "As proposed (84 FR 7442), the USCDI v1 included the pediatric vital sign data elements,\nwhich are specified as optional health information in the 2015 Edition CCDS definition. The\nproposed pediatric vital signs included: head occipital-frontal circumference for children less\nthan 3 years of age, BMI percentile per age and sex for youth 2-20 years of age, weight for age\nper length and sex for children less than 3 years of age, and the reference range/scale or growth\n\n\n\n\ncurve, as appropriate. As explained in section VI.A.2 of this final rule, the inclusion of pediatric\nvital sign Data Elements in the draft USCDI v1 align with the provisions of the Cures Act related\nto health IT to support the health care of children. Prior to the publication of the Proposed Rule,\nstakeholders emphasized the value of pediatric vital sign data elements to better support the\nsafety and quality of care delivered to children. We also note in our Proposed Rule and in the\n2015 Edition proposed rule (80 FR 16818 and 16819) that the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) recommends as part of best practices the use of these pediatric vital signs for\nsettings of care in which pediatric and adolescent patients are seen. The availability of a\nreference range/scale or growth curve would help with proper interpretation of the measurements\nfor the BMI percentile per age and sex and weight for age per length and sex.\n\nFurther, we noted our belief that the inclusion of this health information in the USCDI v1\nwas the appropriate next step after first specifying them as optional in the CCDS definition as\npart of the 2015 Edition rulemaking (80 FR 62695), and as a means of supporting patient access\nto their EHI in a longitudinal format through certified health IT (see section 3009(e)(2)(A)(i) of\nthe PHSA as amended by the Cures Act). We recognized, however, that certain health IT\ndevelopers and their customers may not find these capabilities and information useful. Therefore,\nwe requested comment on the inclusion of pediatric vital signs in the USCDI v1, including the\npotential benefits and costs for all stakeholders stemming from its inclusion in the USCDI v1.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported the inclusion of the pediatric vital signs\nData Elements in the USCDI v1. Some commenters opposed their inclusion or believed the\ninclusion of these Data Elements should be optional since pediatric vital signs are not applicable\nto all specialties and would add implementation burden and cost without benefit. One commenter\nstated that only the measurements and associated metadata (units of measure, date/time\nmeasurement taken, method of measurement), not the calculated percentiles according to\n\n\n\n\napplicable pediatric growth charts, should be required as part of the exchange of patient data.\n\nOne commenter recommended adding the nutritional status Data Element “mid-arm\ncircumference.” Finally, several commenters suggested or requested clarification on the pediatric\nvital signs Data Elements we proposed (84 FR 7442). Specifically, stakeholders in the pediatric\ncommunity asked for clarification of the proposed pediatric vital sign “weight for age per length\nand sex for children less than 3 years of age,” noting it does not correspond to any existing\npediatric growth charts. Rather, they noted that there is a growth chart “weight-for-length\" for\nchildren less than 3 years of age.\n\n*Response.* We recognize that the adoption of these Data Elements has the potential to add\nburden and cost for some health IT products, but we believe the inclusion of these Data Elements\ncan contribute significantly to the longitudinal care of patients. Pediatric care is not isolated to a\nsingle specialty or setting of care, and clinicians providing health care for children – especially\nthose providing care for children with complex conditions – may practice in a wide range of\nsettings using a wide range of health IT systems. Many key stakeholders believe that the ability\nto capture, calculate, and transmit key pediatric growth data using health IT is critical to\nproviding care to these populations as well as communicating with other providers,\nparent/guardians, and patients. We also note that adoption of the USCDI standard and its Data\nClasses and elements is not specific as to its usage within a setting of care, a health care\nspecialty, or by a specific category of health IT user; rather it applies to certified health IT’s\nability to send and receive those Data Elements without requirements regarding functionality,\nuser interface, or the use of those Data Elements in exchange. While some users may find few\nopportunities to exchange these Data Elements, many will exchange these Data Elements\nfrequently. As we have noted previously, we believe that the adoption of USCDI for all certified\nhealth IT will advance interoperability by ensuring compliance with new data and vocabulary\n\n\n\n\ncodes sets that support the data.\n\nWe also appreciate the commenter’s suggestion for an additional Data Element. As we\nhave noted, ONC will establish and follow a predictable, transparent, and collaborative process\nto expand the USCDI, which will provide stakeholders with the opportunity to advance\nadditional Data Classes and Data Elements relevant to a wide range of use cases related to health\ncare.\n\nRegarding the request to clarify and better define these proposed pediatric vital signs, we\nnote that these Data Elements, as written and proposed, were previously included as optional\nhealth information in the 2015 Edition CCDS definition. The discrepancy between the adopted\npediatric vital signs and standardized pediatric growth charts was not identified previously.\n\nTherefore, we wish to clarify that the above-referenced pediatric vital signs include both the vital\nmeasurements and the percentiles used in the following growth charts currently recommended by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:33\nfor infants birth to 36 months of age: weight-\nfor-length; and head occipital-frontal circumference for age; and for children 2-20 years of age:\nbody mass index (BMI) for age.\n\nIn consideration of these comments, we have finalized the following pediatric Data\nElements in the Vital Signs Data Class of the USCDI v1: head occipital-frontal circumference\npercentile (Birth to 36 Months); weight-for-length percentile (Birth to 36 Months); body mass\nindex (BMI) percentile (2-20 Years of Age); and the reference range/scale or growth curve, as\nappropriate.\n\n\n",

We also received similar feedback\nduring the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) stakeholder\nsessions and public comment period. As we noted, “clinical notes” have been identified by\nstakeholders as highly desirable data for interoperable exchange. The free text portion of the\nclinical notes was most often relayed by clinicians as the data they sought, but were often\nmissing during electronic health information exchange. We additionally noted that clinical notes\ncan be composed of text generated from structured (pick-list and/or check the box) fields as well\nas unstructured (free text) data. We explained that a clinical note may include the assessment,\ndiagnosis, plan of care and evaluation of plan, patient teaching, and other relevant data points.\n\nWe recognized that a number of different types of clinical notes could be useful for\nstakeholders. We indicated our understanding that work is being done in the community to focus\non a subset of clinical notes. We considered three options for identifying the different “note\ntypes” to adopt in USCDI v1. The first option we considered allowed for the community to offer\nany and all recommended notes. The second option we considered set a minimum standard of\neight note types. This option was derived from the eight note types identified by the Argonaut\nProject participants.34\nThe third option we identified looked to the eleven HL7 Consolidated\nClinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) document types identified in the C-CDA Release 2.1,\nwhich also included the note types being identified by the Argonaut Project participants. We\nultimately proposed the second option because it unites public and private interests toward the\nsame goal. We indicated that the eight selected note types were a minimum bar and, in the future,\n34\nLink to the Clinical Notes Argonaut Project identified (to clarify: seven bullets are listed, however, we split\nlaboratory and pathology note types into their own note)\nhttp://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201805_Clinical_Notes_Track\n\n\n\n\nthe USCDI could be updated to include other clinical notes. Specifically, we proposed to include\nthe following clinical note types for both inpatient and outpatient (primary care, emergency\ndepartment, etc.) settings in USCDI v1 as a minimum standard: (1) Discharge Summary note; (2)\nHistory & Physical; (3) Progress Note; (4) Consultation Note; (5) Imaging Narrative; (6)\nLaboratory Report Narrative; (7) Pathology Report Narrative; and (8) Procedures Note (84 FR\n7442). We requested comment on whether to include additional note types as part of the USCDI\nv1.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters broadly supported adding “clinical notes” as a new Data Class\nto the USCDI v1, in particular to enable the use of free text for data exchange. Several\ncommenters requested clarity as to whether the proposal to adopt this new Data Class would\nrequire the capture and exchange of unstructured, or “raw” or “free” text, narrative clinical\ninformation or more comprehensive documents such as those defined by C-CDA. Some\ncommenters recommended adding certain note types—including continuity of care, operative,\nand nursing notes—while others recommended removing some of the proposed note types. In\nparticular, Laboratory/Pathology Report Narrative note types were thought to be duplicative of\ncontent in the Laboratory Data Class and element Value/Results. Some commenters\nrecommended Imaging Narrative not be used, but added to a new Data Class, Diagnostic Tests,\nwhich would combine Laboratory and Radiology tests and results.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and recommendations. While we\nrecognize that there may be alternative methods of organizing different clinical note types, we\nbelieve there is value in grouping all clinical notes into a single Data Class within the USCDI. As\nwe noted above and in the Proposed Rule, we have adopted the eight note types identified by the\nArgonaut Project participants because it unites public and private interests toward the same goal.\n\nAs we indicated, the eight selected note types are a minimum bar and, in the future, the USCDI\n\n\n\n\ncould be updated to include other clinical note types. The eight selected note types reflect the\nmost clearly and consistently recommended set of clinical note type. While a variety of\nadditional note types were recommended, there was no consensus for additional note types\nbeyond these eight. In consideration of these comments, we have finalized the clinical notes as a\nData Class in the USCDI v1, with only the following eight clinical note types for both inpatient\nand outpatient (primary care, emergency department, etc.) settings as a minimum standard as\nproposed: (1) Discharge Summary Note; (2) History & Physical; (3) Progress Note; (4)\nConsultation Note; (5) Imaging Narrative; (6) Laboratory Report Narrative; (7) Pathology Report\nNarrative; and (8) Procedures Note.\n\nWe wish to further clarify that we have adopted the new Clinical Notes Data Class in\norder to enable capture and exchange of free text clinical information categorized by the above\nclinical note types. We refer commenters to our response in section IV.B.1.d of the final rule -\nClinical Notes C-CDA Implementation Specification - that addresses the relationship of the\nclinical notes Data Class to C-CDA implementation specification.\n\nWe also seek to clarify two points. First, that these clinical note types are content\nexchange standard agnostic. They should not be interpreted or associated with the specific C-\nCDA Document Templates that may share the same name. Secondly, we clarify that these note\ntypes are required to be represented in their plain-text form when included in various content\nexchange standards (e.g., C-CDA, FHIR) as may be applicable to the certification criteria in\nwhich the USCDI is referenced.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed (84 FR 7442) for the USCDI v1 to include a new Data Class, entitled\n\n\n\n\n“provenance.” As we indicated, stakeholders35\nhave identified “provenance” as valuable for\ninteroperable exchange. Stakeholders also referenced the provenance of data as a fundamental\nneed to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of the data being exchanged. Provenance\ndescribes the metadata, or extra information about data, that can help answer questions such as\nwho created the data and when.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we noted that the inclusion of “provenance” as a Data Class in the\nUSCDI v1 would also complement the Cures Act requirement in section 4002(a) to support the\nexchange of data through the use of APIs. This approach differs from the exchange of data via\nthe C-CDA. While C-CDAs are often critiqued due to their relative “length,” the C-CDA\nrepresents the output of a clinical encounter and includes relevant context. The same will not\nalways be true in an API context. APIs facilitate the granular exchange of data and, as noted in\nthe original 2015 Edition final rule, offer the potential to aggregate data from multiple sources\nusing a web or mobile application (80 FR 62675). The inclusion of provenance would help retain\nthe relevant context so the recipient can better understand the origin of the data.\n\nWe proposed to further delineate the provenance Data Class into three Data Elements:\n“the author,” which represents the person(s) who is responsible for the information; “the author’s\ntime stamp,” which indicates the time the information was recorded; and “the author’s\norganization,” which would be the organization the author is associated with at the time they\ninteracted with the data (84 FR 7442). We indicated that we identified these three Data Elements\nas fundamental for data recipients to have available and noted that they are commonly captured\nand currently available through standards. We requested comment on the inclusion of these three\nData Elements and whether any other provenance Data Elements, such as the identity of the\n35\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement\n\n\n\n\nindividual or entity the data was obtained from or sent by (sometimes discussed in standards\nworking groups as the provenance of the data’s “last hop”), would be essential to include as part\nof the USCDI v1 standard. We acknowledged that there is currently work to help define\nprovenance in a standard robust manner, and that we anticipated adopting the industry consensus\nonce it became available.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters overwhelmingly supported the addition of provenance as a new\nData Class for USCDI v1. Several commenters stated that the proposed elements were\ninsufficient for the purpose of audit logs for use and disclosure of health data, citing the existing\nstandard specification ASTM E2147.36\nOther commenters stated that these proposed elements\ndid not apply to all use cases of exchanged data and requested clarification regarding\napplicability, including whether provenance would have to be created for elements created\nbefore the implementation deadline of USCDI v1. Because this is a new Data Class, some\ncommenters also requested additional time to adopt and implement this new requirement. Some\ncommenters stated that there could be ambiguity in designating “author” for certain clinical\ninformation such as patient-reported medications, while in certain other cases, there could be\nmultiple authors for the same clinical information, such as clinical notes. Additionally, some\ncommenters suggested that the “author” be limited to only a limited set of Data Elements and not\nto all the Data Elements. Another commenter specifically addressed several concerns related to\nthe definition of “author” for this purpose. Commenters specifically stated they understood\nauthor to be the person entering the data into the EHR, but noted that data may also be historical,\ncaptured from a device, started by a patient and completed by clinical staff, entered by a patient,\nentered by resident/students working under a supervising physician, or reported by a patient. The\n36\nhttps://www.astm.org/Standards/E2147.htm\n\n\n\n\ncommenter noted that there are additional documentation scenarios such as dictation to scribes or\nother medical staff, which conflate “responsibility” for authorship, and that defining author for\nevery Data Element can be complex. Finally, one health IT developer recommended a 36-month\nimplementation period to begin only after test procedures, implementation guides, and test and\nvalidation tools are available and after ONC has consulted at least five CEHRT developers.\n\n*Response.* We acknowledge that these Data Elements may not be able to fully support the\nneeds of all use cases, but we believe their adoption will improve the trustworthiness and\nreliability of data being exchanged. For this Data Class, it appears that many commenters over-\ninterpreted our proposal and the effect of having these data in the USCDI. As we noted earlier,\nthe adoption of the USCDI standard and its Data Classes and elements is not specific as to its\nusage within a setting of care, a health care specialty, or by a specific category of health IT user.\n\nRather it applies to certified health IT’s ability to send and receive those Data Elements without\nrequirements regarding functionality, user interface, or the use of those Data Elements in\nexchange. Therefore, with respect to our reference to provenance data in the USCDI, we have no\npreset notion or explicit upfront requirement for how this data should be used. We believe that\nhaving provenance data is highly impactful, essential for trustworthy interoperability, and will\ngenerate greater value for stakeholders as they identify new ways to put this data to use.\n\nRegarding “author” as a Data Element within the provenance Data Class, we agree that\nsignificant practical scope challenges may arise. Our analysis of the concerns raised by\ncommenters identified a risk of unintended burden and potential risk of error and misattribution\nassociated with this particular Data Element. In most use cases, the inclusion of author\norganization and author time stamp is sufficient to convey provenance. As a result, we have not\nfinalized the “author” as a required Data Element within the provenance Data Class in USCDI.\n\nHowever, we understand that for exchanging certain data elements, such as “clinical notes,” it is\n\n\n\n\ncritical to also send the “author” information if available. Our analysis of the various content\nexchange standards and specifications (e.g., C-CDA and FHIR) indicates that even though the\n“author” Data Element is not explicitly required in USCDI, the health IT specifications in which\nUSCDI Data Elements are represented also set specific data element requirements for certain\ncontexts. For example, in the context of clinical notes, these content exchange standards require\nhealth IT systems to be capable of exchanging “author” information when it is available. Further,\n“author” is treated as a “Must Support” data element in the FHIR US Core Implementation\nGuide STU 3.1.0 and has a “SHALL” constraint (with appropriate null flavor value) in the C-\nCDA 2.1. As we have noted previously, we believe that the proposed 24-month timeline for\nupdating certified health IT to comply with the new USCDI standard in § 170.213 is an adequate\nimplementation timeline and will maintain this requirement as finalized earlier in this section.\n\nTherefore, in consideration of the comments received, we have finalized the provenance\nData Class in the USCDI v1 and the following two Data Elements:\n “author time stamp,” which indicates the time the information was recorded;\nand\n “author organization,” which would be the organization the author is associated\nwith at the time they interacted with the data.\n\nWe believe these two provenance Data Elements, “author organization” and “author time\nstamp,” within the USCDI v1, which are also used in the C-CDA and FHIR-based certification\ncriteria we have adopted that incorporate the USCDI, will serve as a foundation on which\nindustry stakeholders can subsequently work together to build out additional provenance data\nrequirements in the USCDI. As noted above, we have not finalized the proposed Data Element\n“the author,” which represents the person(s) who was responsible for the information.\n\n\n",

This approach would remove the Medication Allergies Data Element from the\nMedication Data Class and add it to a new Data Class titled “Substance Reactions,” which would\ninclude the concept of “Medication Allergies.” The new “Substance Reactions” Data Class\nwould include the following Data Elements: “Substance” and “Reaction,” and include SNOMED\nCT as an additional applicable standard for non-medication substances.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the creation of a new Data Class\n“Substance Reactions” but requested we preserve the Medication Allergy element because of\npatient safety concerns related to the adoption of an entirely new Data Element. One commenter\nsupported the change but recommended the new Data Class name be aligned with the HL7 FHIR\nresource “AllergyIntolerance.” This would also be consistent with the C-CDA 2.1 “Allergy and\nIntolerance” section.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their input. While we appreciate that there may\nbe some risk associated with the adoption of a new Data Element, we believe this alternative\napproach better aligns with other standards representing substance reactions, including\nmedication allergies, and this alignment enhances patient safety. Additionally, we agree with the\ncommenter who suggested renaming this new Data Class to align with FHIR and C-CDA\napproaches.\n\nIn consideration of comments, we have finalized the creation of a Data Class in USCDI\nv1 entitled “Allergies and Intolerances,” instead of “Substance Reactions” from the original\nUSCDI v1 proposal. The Allergies and Intolerances Data Class in USCDI v1 consists of the\nfollowing Data Elements: “Substance – (Medication),” “Substance – (Drug Class),” and\n\n\n\n\n“Reaction.” “Substance – (Medication)” must be represented by RxNorm codes and “Substance\n– (Drug Class)” must be represented by SNOMED CT codes. The addition of the “Substance –\n(Drug Class)” better represents when an individual may have a reaction to an entire drug class as\nopposed to a specific medication. Additionally, we believe having the Allergy and Intolerances\nData Class separated from the Medication Class will accommodate potential additions of other\nsubstance Data Elements such as food, environmental, and biologic agents. The Data Element\n“Reaction” is meant to include, but is not limited to, medication allergies. As the USCDI is\nupdated over time to include substances other than medications, we can also see the need to have\nsubstance reactions updated as part of this Data Class. To reflect this change, we have updated\nthe terminology in the regulatory text in § 170.315 to remove “medication allergy” and replace\nwith “allergy and intolerance.”\n\n\n",

The C-CDA Companion Guide provides\nsupplemental guidance and additional technical clarification for specifying data in the C-CDA\nRelease 2.1.37\nAs we noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7443), the proposed USCDI v1 included\nnew Data Classes, such as “clinical notes,” which were further supported through the C-CDA\nCompanion Guide. For example, the C-CDA Companion Guide provides specifications for\nclinical notes by indicating that clinical notes should be recorded in “note activity” and requires\nreferences to other discrete data, such as “encounters.” The C-CDA Companion Guide also\nenhances implementation of the updated 2015 Edition certification criteria that reference the C-\nCDA Release 2.1 (§ 170.205(a)(4)). As noted by stakeholders, the C-CDA Release 2.1 includes\nsome optionality and ambiguity with respect to Data Element components, such as the locations\nand value sets. We attempted to address some of this optionality by clarifying requirements using\nCertification Companion Guides (CCGs)38\nand by specifying in the CCDS definition where\ncertain data should be placed in the C-CDA Release 2.1 templates (e.g., “goals” in the goals\nsection).39\nThe C-CDA Companion Guide, which was released in August, 2015, provides\nsimilar, but additional C-CDA implementation structure. For example, race and ethnicity are\nrequired Data Elements in the USCDI and must be included in C-CDA exchanges if known, or\nthey may be marked with a nullFlavor value “UNK” (unknown) if not known. The C-CDA\nRelease 2.1 is unclear on the location and value set, but the C-CDA Companion Guide clarifies\nthe location and value set. We noted in the Proposed Rule that the adoption of the C-CDA\n37\nhttp://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=447\n38\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/2015-edition-test-method\n39\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/topiclanding/2018-04/2015Ed_CCG_CCDS.pdf\n\n\n\n\nCompanion Guide would align with our goal to increase the use of consistent implementation of\nstandards among health IT developers and improve interoperability. We proposed to adopt this\nC-CDA Companion Guide to support best practice implementation of USCDI v1 Data Classes\nand 2015 Edition certification criteria that reference C-CDA Release 2.1 (§ 170.205(a)(4)).

Two commenters\nrecommended review of the CommonWell Concise Consolidated CDA white paper.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their suggestions and support. During the past\nfew months, industry stakeholders updated the C-CDA Companion Guide to a newer version to\nbest address how clinical notes should be handled in the C-CDA.

                  "title": "a. Electronic Prescribing Standard and Certification Criterion",
                  "text": "We proposed to adopt a new version of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard in 45 CFR\n170.205(b)(1), specifically NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 (84 FR 7444). Because\nwe proposed to adopt a new standard for electronic prescribing (e-Rx), we also proposed to adopt\na new certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) for the proposed e-Rx standard to replace the old\nstandard in § 170.315(b)(3). The proposed new certification criterion reflected our proposed\nadoption of NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 as well as all transactions adopted for the\nCMS Medicare Part D E-prescribing Program (84 FR 23832). These proposals were made to\nrealign ONC’s Health IT Certification Program (Program) policies with those of CMS’ Part D E-\nprescribing rules. ONC and CMS have historically aligned standards adopted under their\nprograms such as those for e-Rx and medication history (MH) to ensure that entities regulated\nunder both schemes can comply with the different programs’ requirements. For this reason, we\nstated that should our proposal to adopt the new e-Rx criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)) be finalized\nprior to January 1, 2020, we also proposed to permit continued certification to the current 2015\nEdition “electronic prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) that references NCPDP SCRIPT\nstandard version 10.6 for the period of time in which that version of the NCPDP SCRIPT\nstandard would continue to be used in the CMS Medicare Part D E-prescribing Program or the\nCMS Promoting Interoperability Programs. Finally, we proposed in 84 FR 7445 that once\nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 10.6 is no longer used in those Programs, we would no longer\npermit certification to that criterion and would remove it from the Code of Federal Regulations,\nand that we would consider setting an effective date for such actions in a subsequent final rule\nbased on stakeholder feedback and CMS policies at the time.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to continuing to reference the current transactions included in §\n170.315(b)(3), in keeping with CMS' Modernizing Part D and Medicare Advantage To Lower\nDrug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Expenses final rule (84 FR 23832), we also proposed in\n84 FR 7445 and in § 170.315(b)(11) to require the support of all of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard\nversion 2017071 transactions CMS has adopted for the Part D E-prescribing regulations in 42\nCFR 423.160(b)(2)(iv). Given the January 1, 2020 effective date in CMS rulemaking (83 FR\n16440) and the effective date of this final rule, we have finalized our proposed update to the new\nversion of the standard for the electronic prescribing criterion in § 170.315(b)(3) instead of\ncreating a new criterion as proposed in 84 FR 7427 in § 170.315(b)(11). Unlike other criteria in\nthis final rule that allow testing to either version of a required standard until 24 months after the\npublication date of this final rule, we will not allow certification testing to version 10.6 of the\nNCPDP SCRIPT standard, as the implementation date for CMS’ new Part D E-prescribing\nProgram of January 1, 2020 has passed. However, based on stakeholder feedback, we have\nfinalized a transition period in 45 CFR 170.405(b)(4)(ii) of 24 months from the date of\npublication of this final rule for certification so developers may test and certify to the updated\ncriterion with all associated transactions.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters were supportive of our proposal and\nrecommended moving to the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 for the e-Rx\ncertification criterion in alignment with CMS’ adoption of the standard for the Part D E-\nprescribing Program. However, a number of commenters expressed concern that while EHRs or\nother electronic prescribing systems may become certified, pharmacy information systems (PIS)\nlack a similar certification program and associated standards and technical capability\nrequirements, thus creating a mismatch between the e-prescribing system requirements for EHR\nusers and PIS users. Several commenters specifically noted that PIS, which send or receive these\n\n\n\n\ntransactions, are not required to adopt the capability to support these transactions as they are out\nof scope for the Program.\n\n*Response.* First, we note that the comments suggesting that pharmacies on the sending or\nreceiving end of Part D e-Rx transactions are not required to utilize NCPDP SCRIPT standard\nversion 2017071 transactions are inaccurate. To the extent that a pharmacy conducts electronic\nprescribing with prescribers e-prescribing Part D covered drugs for Part D eligible individuals,\nthose pharmacies are required to use the NCPDP SCRIPT version 2017071 standard. While there\nmay not be 2015 Edition certification criteria to which pharmacy information systems can be\ncertified, the Part D rules require support of the standard under the Part D E-prescribing\nProgram. Thus, we believe the mismatch concerns raised by commenters are unfounded. As a\ngeneral matter, Part D prescribers need health IT systems capable of conducting compliant\ntransactions (regardless of ONC certification) and so too do Part D receiving pharmacies. ONC\nhealth IT certification will provide an added layer of assurance for Part D prescribers that their e-\nRx systems have been tested and certified as being capable of accurately conducting the adopted\nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 transactions.42\nIn addition, we received several comments related to the readiness of PIS for specific\ntransactions beyond those defined for Part D. We include these comments as applicable in the\ndiscussion of each transaction below. We reiterate that PIS are outside the scope of the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program, and we acknowledge the challenge of pharmacy readiness to\nsupport all transactions at this time, but if they conduct e-Rx for part D covered drugs prescribed\nto Part D eligible Medicare beneficiaries, they will be required to use the standard we are\nadopting for our program by the Medicare Part D e-Rx Program – so if they do e-prescribing at\n42\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-10-16/pdf/2015-25597.pdf\n\n\n\n\nall, we expect that they will be able to conduct transactions using the standard adopted here.\n\nGenerally, the goal of certification is to ensure that Health IT Modules voluntarily submitted for\nthe Program are capable of conducting the transactions as specified. This ensures that providers\nhave the capability to use the certified product for these transactions where feasible. For this\nreason, we have finalized the transactions as described below for certified Health IT Modules\nand encourage pharmacy information system developers to advance their capacity to support a\nnationwide network of fully interoperable pharmacy information systems.\n\n*Comments.* As noted, the majority of commenters were supportive of the proposal to\nremove the 2015 Edition certification criterion (codified in § 170.315(b)(3)) that references\nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 10.6 and replace it with an updated e-Rx criterion (proposed\nto be codified in § 170.315(b)(11)). Commenters requested that ONC work with CMS on a\nsmooth transition and timeline that would allow adequate time for the development, testing, and\nfull adoption of these updates. A number of commenters stated that the NCPDP SCRIPT\nstandard version 2017071 is not backward compatible with NCPDP SCRIPT standard version\n10.6, and therefore there should be no transition period where both standards are applicable.\n\nCommenters sought clarity on the timing of the change and expressed concerns that developers\nand providers may face operational issues in their adoption of version 2017071 of the NCPDP\nSCRIPT standard by January 1, 2020. Commenters recommended that ONC allow certification\ntimelines that support compliance with Part D while allowing adequate time to mitigate the risk\nassociated with the additional requirements for certification to the proposed criterion.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by commenters as well as the concern\nabout maintaining alignment between required standards across HHS. We note that the CMS\nrequirement for Part D e-Rx transactions includes a compliance date of January 1, 2020, and that\nindustry feedback notes a consistent and deliberate move toward readiness for the adoption of the\n\n\n\n\nnew standard for Part D e-Rx, including by health IT industry leaders supporting pharmacy\nimplementation. We believe that this overall industry readiness supports our adoption of the\nupdate to the standard for certification purposes and to be in alignment with the required\nstandard update for Part D e-Rx purposes. In response to the request for a smooth transition and\ncontinuity of certification for health care providers, we have finalized a revision to the existing\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(3) rather than removing and replacing the criterion. In order to support\nthe transition to the new standard for Part D, at the request of stakeholders, ONC issued\nguidance43\nin the third quarter of CY2019 stating, “... developers of 2015 Edition certified Health\nIT Modules certified to the e-prescribing criterion adopted at 45 CFR 170.315(b)(3) are\npermitted to update their products to use the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 to meet\nCMS’ compliance requirements...” This guidance also noted that ONC would discontinue\ncertification of new products to the electronic prescribing certification criterion using version\n10.6 of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard as of January 1, 2020.\n\nIn consideration of the comments we received, we have finalized our proposal to update\nthe electronic prescribing (e-Rx) NCPDP SCRIPT standard used for electronic prescribing in the\n2015 Edition to NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071, which results in a new e-Rx\nstandard becoming the baseline for certification. As the effective date of this final rule will occur\nafter January 1, 2020, we have not finalized our proposal to permit new products to continue to\nbe certified to the prior standard until the January 1, 2020 date. Instead, we discontinued\ncertification of new products to the former electronic prescribing criterion using the NCPDP\nSCRIPT standard version 10.6 to align with CMS requirements. We have finalized this update as\na modification to the existing certification criterion rather than as a separate new certification\n43\nFor Part D covered drugs prescribed for Part D eligible individuals. ONC Electronic Prescribing Certification\nCompanion Guide: https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/electronic-prescribing\n\n\n\n\ncriterion to allow for a smooth transition, and to allow for continuity with the certification(s)\nissued to Health IT Modules for § 170.315(b)(3) prior to January 1, 2020 that are updated under\nthe ONC guidance. This approach will also continue to allow for compliance with the January 1,\n2020 timeline for CMS' Medicare Part D e-Rx and Medication History standards.\n\nAs noted by commenters, we understand that there is a lack of backward compatibility\nbetween the two standards. In order to allow for a reasonable transition period to certification to\nthe full set of NCPDP SCRIPT transactions and other requirements defined in the updated e-Rx\ncertification criterion, we have framed our Maintenance of Certification in section 45 CFR\n170.405(b)(5)(ii) with flexibility that will allow health IT developers up to 24 months from the\ndate of publication of this final rule to test and certify to the updated criterion reflective of all\nNCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 transactions to demonstrate full conformance with the updated\ncriterion. After January 1, 2020, use of the NCPDP SCRIPT 10.6 standard will be prohibited\nunder the Part D program, so we do not expect or anticipate health IT systems certified to §\n170.315(b)(3) will conduct Part D transactions using that standard. We also recognize, however,\nfor the purposes of maintaining a product certificate with § 170.315(b)(3) in its scope, that these\n24 months from the date of publication from this final rule enable continued compliance and\noversight associated with other capabilities in § 170.315(b)(3) that are not applicable for Part D,\nand for which conformance is still required.\n\nWe have finalized this 24-month period for the update for this criterion under the real\nworld testing provisions in § 170.405(b)(5) as follows:\n Electronic Prescribing. A health IT developer with health IT certified to § 170.315(b)(3)\nprior to June 30, 2020, must:\no Update their certified health IT to be compliant with the revised versions of this\ncriterion adopted in § 170.315(b)(3)(ii); and\n\n\n\n\no Provide its customers of the previously certified health IT with certified health IT\nthat meets paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section by May 2, 2022.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "*Comments.* Commenters expressed concerns about standardization generally within the\ncontext of e-prescribing. Several commenters expressed concern about using the NCPDP\nSCRIPT standard version 2017071, the RxNorm standard, as a requirement for e-prescribing,\nand other standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). One commenter\nfurther stated that only inventory (packaging or unit dose strength) codes are standardized in\nRxNorm, and that drug regimens should be standardized and made computable in RxNorm for\nsafety reasons. Another commenter noted that RxNorm does not index brand names exhaustively\nwith a single unique ID for each branded drug, but that current indexing only allows for generic-\nlevel interoperability and only at unit dose level. One commenter expressed concern that the\ncriterion as proposed does not appear to support medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid\nuse disorder (OUD) and other long-acting medications. Another commenter stated a hope that\nstandards such as the NCPDP SCRIPT version 2017071 standard can ease data integration into\nthe workflow, lessen burden, and help achieve greater compliance with policy and legal\nrequirements for querying State prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP). Another\ncommenter supported the adoption of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 because\nthe standard supports the prescribing of compound medications and the sig (i.e., instructions)\nfield is not limited to 140 characters.\n\nSome commenters also provided suggestions to improve the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071\nstandard and its availability to the public by the standards developing organization. Another\ncommenter stated that today's NCPDP standards are not in an API-ready format, and\nrecommended CMS and ONC collaborate with NCPDP to explore API FHIR standards specific\n\n\n\n\nto the HL7 Da Vinci Project for a January 2022 effective date or later. A few commenters stated\nthat because many NCPDP standards are not openly accessible and require a paid membership to\nobtain the technical specifications, our adoption could limit widespread adoption and a\nstandardized implementation nationwide. Several commenters suggested that ONC adopt FHIR\nas a standard for the Program, and for the e-Rx criterion specifically. We also received several\ncomments that are out of scope which are not addressed in this rulemaking.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ consideration of the standards. We note that\nRxNorm is a standard maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). ONC adopted\nRxNorm to represent medication information as a vocabulary standard in § 170.207(d) (80 FR\n62612). We encourage all developers who have experience with, and feedback relevant to,\nRxNorm to contact NLM. As a reminder, RxNorm is considered a minimum standard code set\nunder the Program, and developers are permitted to upgrade their products to comply with a\nnewer version of RxNorm without adversely affecting a product’s certification status pursuant to\n45 CFR 170.555(b)(2) as long as no other law prohibits such action.\n\nIn reference to the OUD prevention and treatment-related concerns that commenters\nexpressed, we note that the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard does support the exchange of\nmedicines used in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder treatment\npurposes. An electronic prescription of controlled substances transaction containing a MAT drug\nsuch as buprenorphine can be sent from a prescriber to a pharmacy through the specified\ntransactions, and the updated § 170.315(b)(3) criterion also requires the inclusion of a reason for\nthe prescription using <Diagnosis><Primary> or <Secondary> elements, or optionally, the\ntechnology must be able to receive and transmit the reason for the prescription using the\n<IndicationforUse> element. In addition, the RxHistoryRequest transaction contains a patient\nconsent indicator that the receiving entity must evaluate for accurate reporting. We are also\n\n\n\n\naware that many PDMPs across the country accept reporting of medication history transactions\ncontaining buprenorphine, naltrexone, and other medications that could be used in the treatment\nof OUD.\n\nWe thank commenters for their input related to improvements that could be made to the\nNCPDP SCRIPT version 2017071 standard, however NCPDP is a member-driven standards\ndeveloping organization that requires membership in order to participate in standards developing\nand to access standards and implementation guides. We appreciate the suggestion to provide a\ndirect link to the appropriate NCPDP SCRIPT standard implementation guide, but we have no\nauthority over the business processes of standards developing organizations like NCPDP. We\nencourage any and all participants with an interest in improving the standard to engage with\nNCPDP. Regarding the recommendation for ONC to collaborate with NCPDP to explore FHIR,\nwe appreciate the suggestion and support any advancements in technical standards and\nframeworks that support interoperability. At this time, NCPDP SCRIPT standard version\n2017071 has not been mapped to FHIR, but ONC will continue to monitor the industry for\nopportunities to align the ONC Health IT Certification Program with industry developments.\n\n*Comments.* Five commenters fully supported all proposed transactions and requirements\ndetailed in the Proposed Rule. The vast majority of commenters noted concerns about the\nproposed criterion specific to the transactions proposed for adoption in the § 170.315(b)(11) e-\nRx certification criterion; details in support or not in support of adoption as proposed are further\ndetailed for each type of transaction below. As a whole, the primary concerns for the transactions\nand requirements as proposed include the following: 1) EHRs are required to comply with the\nnew transactions and requirements, while receiving pharmacy information systems are not; 2)\nlack of pharmacy adoption and readiness, as sufficient adoption should occur prior to making the\ntransactions required; and 3) implementation of the proposed transactions and requirements is\n\n\n\n\nresource intensive, if not prohibitive, in order to meet the January 1, 2020 deadline set by CMS.\n\nSeveral commenters suggested either an extension or that certain transactions should be made\noptional.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all of the public comments and have modified the transactions\nto specify which transactions are finalized as required for Health IT Modules for purposes of\nobtaining or retaining certification to § 170.315(b)(3), which are optional for Health IT Modules\nfor purposes of obtaining or retaining certification to § 170.315(b)(3), and any other §\n170.315(b)(3) requirements below. Additional public comment received and related responses\nare grouped below based on the comment’s relation to the specific transactions. We note that\n“optional” for the purposes of certification does not mean, and should not be interpreted as,\n“optional” for Part D E-prescribing Program compliance. To the extent that prescribers and\npharmacies conduct electronic prescribing with Part D covered drugs prescribed for Part D\neligible individuals they will be required to use the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard to\nconduct those transactions under the Part D E-prescribing Program. Thus, a transaction\ndesignated as “optional” for the purposes of certification means a health IT developer can elect\nto have that transaction explicitly tested as part of certification for its product or can choose not\nto do so – either will allow its product to be certified to § 170.315(b)(3). We reiterate that\ncomments regarding CMS’ January 1, 2020 timeline are out of scope as we cannot change CMS’\npolicy or its timeline.\n\n\n",

RxFillIndicator informs the pharmacy of the\nprescriber’s intent for fill status notifications for a specific patient/medication. An\nRxFillIndicatorChange is sent by a prescriber to a pharmacy to indicate that the prescriber is\nchanging the types of RxFill transactions that were previously requested, and in which the\nprescriber may modify the fill status of transactions previously selected or may cancel future\nRxFill transactions.\n\n*Comments.* While the RxFill transaction received unanimous support as a required\ntransaction, the vast majority of comments opposed adopting the RxFillIndicatorChange as\nproposed due to a lack of industry adoption and broad use by PIS.

Another commenter argued that RxFillIndicatorChange should\nbe optional as development to support this transaction in NCPDP SCRIPT standard version\n2017071 would be resource intensive.

An RxHistoryResponse is a response to an RxHistoryRequest\n\n\n\n\ncontaining a patient’s medication history. It includes the medications that were dispensed or\nobtained within a certain timeframe, and optionally includes the prescriber that prescribed it.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters supported adoption of the RxHistoryRequest and\nRxHistoryResponse transactions as proposed. One commenter also stated that both transactions\ncould facilitate EHR and other health IT data integration with PDMP systems, yet noted that in\nmany cases, State law or policy prohibits data integration between EHRs and PDMPs. Another\ncommenter stated that these transactions are widely used in the industry and provide great value\nto end users.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all comments we have received on the use of the\nRxHistoryRequest and RxHistoryResponse transactions. We agree with the commenter that the\nRxHistoryRequest and RxHistoryResponse transactions support data integration between health\nIT systems such as EHRs and other information technology systems such as PDMPs, and\nencourage any efforts made by developers to fully integrate prescription and other health data\ninto a provider's workflow within allowable law. We reiterate that ONC does not have control\nover State laws that govern PDMPs. We will continue to monitor regulatory and industry\nadvancements in this area and will take them into consideration in future rulemaking. We have\nadopted these transactions as required in the updated § 170.315(b)(3) electronic prescribing\ncriterion. Additionally, we note that pursuant to the certification criterion, health IT presented for\ncertification must be capable of including the reason for the prescription as referenced in the\nupdated § 170.315(b)(3)(ii) or § 170.315(b)(3)(ii)(D) in the RxHistoryResponse transaction.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "The part D e-prescribing prior authorization process in 84 FR 28450 through 28458\nrequires that providers supply additional clinical information to verify that the medication can be\ncovered under the Medicare Part D benefit. The prior authorization process is intended to\npromote better clinical decision-making and ensure that patients receive medically necessary\nprescription drugs. We are looking for ways that would streamline the process for exchanging\n\n\n\n\nclinical and financial data amongst prescribers and payers for prior authorization and improve\npatients’ access to needed medications. Electronic prior authorization (ePA) automates this\nprocess by allowing providers to request and respond to electronic prior authorization\ntransactions within their workflow. Using electronic prior authorization (ePA) transactions in the\nNCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 provides a standard structure for exchanging prior\nauthorization (PA) questions and answers between prescribers and payers, while allowing payers\nto customize the wording of the questions. Electronic prior authorization transactions will\nadditionally support the automation of the collection of data required for PA consideration,\nallowing a health IT developer to systemically pull data from a patient’s medical record. The\nefficiency gains offered by the ePA transactions in the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version\n2017071 are the primary driver behind the development of this new capability. We believe the\nadoption of the ePA transactions included in version 2017071 of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard\nas optional transactions aligns with CMS’ proposals for Part D ePA, and therefore, will not be\nadopting NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2013101 as suggested by the commenter.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, CMS issued the Secure Electronic Prior Authorization for Medicare Part D\nproposed rule (84 FR 28450), including a proposed new transaction standard for the Medicare\nPrescription Drug Benefit program’s (Part D) e-prescribing program. Under this proposal, Part D\nplan sponsors would be required to support version 2017071 of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard for\nfour ePA transactions, and prescribers would be required to use that standard when performing\nePA transactions for Part D covered drugs they wish to prescribe to Part D eligible individuals.\n\nWhile not currently adopted as part of the Part D eRx standard, the NCPDP SCRIPT standard\nversion 2017071 includes eight transactions that would enable the prescribers to initiate\nmedication ePA requests with Part D plan sponsors at the time of the patient’s visit. The eight\ntransactions are: PAInitiationRequest, PAInitiationResponse, PARequest, PAResponse,\n\n\n\n\nPAAppealRequest, PAAppealResponse, PACancelRequest, and PACancelResponse.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended the adoption of the ePA transactions\navailable in the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 for a variety of reasons, including\nimproving efficiencies in the prior authorization process, improving patient outcomes, reducing\npoint-of-sale rejections, increasing health IT developer adoption, and improving the Medicare\nPart D member experience. Several commenters indicated that lack of vendor support for the\nePA transactions is a major barrier to physician use of the transactions. One commenter also\nsuggested ONC adopt the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2013101 prior authorization\ntransactions.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. In consideration of comments, we\nhave adopted the ePA transactions in the NCPDP SCRIPT standard version 2017071 as optional\nfor the updated § 170.315(b)(3) electronic prescribing criterion. We believe the adoption of the\nePA transactions included in version 2017071 of the NCPDP SCRIPT standard as optional\ntransactions aligns with CMS’ proposals for Part D ePA. We note that this final rule allows only\nfor the voluntary certification of Health IT Modules by health IT developers to support these\ntransactions, and does not require the certification, adoption, or use of such Health IT Modules\nby health care providers for this or any other purpose. We also note that development, testing,\nand implementation to support these transactions are important first steps toward integrating\npharmacies in the prior authorization process for Part D prescriptions, while supporting\nwidespread industry adoption and reducing burden on providers. We refer readers to the ONC\nStrategy on Reducing Regulatory and Administrative Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT\nand EHRs,44\ndrafted in partnership with CMS, for further discussion of potential opportunities to\n44\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/usability-and-provider-burden/strategy-reducing-burden-relating-use-health-it-and-\n\n\n\n\nease related clinician burden through improved health IT enabled processes.\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC adopted four clinical quality measure (CQM)\ncertification criteria, § 170.315(c)(1) CQMs – record and export, § 170.315(c)(2) CQMs – import\nand calculate, § 170.315(c)(3) CQMs – report, and § 170.315(c)(4) CQMs – filter (80 FR 62649\nthrough 62655). These four criteria were adopted with the intent to support providers' quality\nimprovement activities and in electronically generating CQM reports for reporting with certified\nhealth IT to programs such as the EHR Incentive Programs, Quality Payment Program, and\nComprehensive Primary Care plus initiative. The “CQMs – report” certification criterion\n(§ 170.315(c)(3)) included an optional certification provision for demonstrating that the health IT\n\n\n\n\ncan create Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) reports in the form and manner\nrequired for submission to CMS programs, which is in accordance with CMS' QRDA\nImplementation Guide (IGs).\n\nThe CMS QRDA IGs provide technical guidance and specific requirements for\nimplementing the HL7 QRDA Category I (QRDA I) and Category III (QRDA III) standards for\nreporting to CMS quality reporting programs.45\nThe CMS QRDA IGs include the formal\ntemplate definitions and submission criteria for submitting QRDA documents to the\nComprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) and Merit Based Incentive Payments System (MIPS)\nPrograms. Some of the conformance statements in the HL7 QRDA standards have been further\nconstrained to meet the specific requirements from these CMS programs. The CMS QRDA IGs\nalso only list the templates specifying CMS-specific reporting requirements from the base HL7\nQRDA standards. QRDA I is an individual-patient-level report. It contains quality data for one\npatient for one or more electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs). QRDA III is an aggregate\nquality report. A QRDA III report contains quality data for a set of patients for one or more\neCQMs.\n\nSince the 2015 Edition final rule was published, we have gained additional certification\nexperience and received feedback from the industry that health IT certified to the “CQMs –\nreport” criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) are only/primarily being used to submit eCQMs to CMS for\nparticipation in CMS’ programs. Therefore, as a means of reducing burden, we proposed to\nremove the HL7 CDA® Release 2 Implementation Guide: QRDA I; Release 1, Draft Standard\nfor Trial Use (DSTU) Release 3 (US Realm), Volume 1 (§ 170.205(h)(2)), as well as the QRDA\n45\nThe following resources provide additional information on the differences between the CMS QRDA and the HL7\nQRDA standards: https://ecqi.healthit.gov/system/files/QRDA_HQR_2019_CMS_IG_final_508.pdf (pg. 38) and\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/2020-CMS-QRDA-III-Eligible-Clinicians-and-EP-IG-07182019-\n508.pdf (pg. 18).\n\n\n\n\nCategory III, Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2 (§ 170.205(k)(1)) and the Errata to the\nHL7 Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2: QRDA Category III, DSTU Release 1 (US\nRealm), September 2014 (§ 170.205(k)(2)) standard requirements (HL7 QRDA standards) from\nthe current 2015 Edition CQMs – report criterion in § 170.315(c)(3), and we also proposed to\nrequire that health IT certified to the current 2015 Edition CQMs – report criterion support the\nCMS QRDA IGs (84 FR 7446). We stated that this change would directly reduce burden on\nhealth IT developers and indirectly providers as they would no longer have to develop and\nsupport two forms of the QRDA standard.\n\nWe also solicited comment in the Proposed Rule on the future possibility of FHIR-\nenabled APIs replacing or complementing QRDA-based quality reporting. We also noted in the\nProposed Rule that the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard offers the\npotential for supporting quality improvement and reporting needs, and holds the potential of\nbeing a more efficient and interoperable standard to develop, implement, and utilize to conduct\nquality reporting through APIs. We believe until the potential benefits of FHIR® APIs can be\nrealized for quality reporting, and that solely requiring the CMS QRDA IGs for the updated 2015\nEdition “CQMs – report” criterion will balance the burden on developers, while still ensuring\nmodule users’ abilities to meet their quality reporting obligations to CMS (84 FR 7446).\n\nTo support the proposal, we proposed to incorporate by reference in § 170.299 the latest\nannual CMS QRDA IGs, specifically the 2019 CMS QRDA I IG for Hospital Quality\nReporting46\n(§ 170.205(h)(3)) and the 2019 CMS QRDA III IG for Eligible Clinicians and\nEligible Professionals (§ 170.205(k)(3)).47\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule that developers would\nbe able to update certified health IT to newer versions of the CMS QRDA IGs through the real\n46\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/system/files/QRDA_HQR_2019_CMS_IG_final_508.pdf\n47\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/system/files/2019_CMS_QRDA_III_Eligible_Clinicians_and_EP_IG-508.pdf\n\n\n\n\nworld testing Maintenance of Certification provision for standards and implementation\nspecification updates in § 170.405(b). We also proposed that a Health IT Module would need to\nbe certified to both standards to ensure flexibility for Health IT Module users. We solicited\ncomment on whether to consider an approach that would permit certification to only one of the\nstandards depending on the care setting for which the Health IT Module is designed and\nimplemented.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters were supportive of the proposal to remove the\nHL7 QRDA standard requirements from the 2015 Edition CQMs – report criterion in §\n170.315(c)(3), and to require that health IT certified to the criterion support the proposed CMS\nQRDA IGs. Some commenters observed that the main use cases for the certified QRDA export\nfunctionality (which is specific to CMS eCQMs) are to support direct data submission to CMS at\nthe conclusion of reporting periods, to enable use of third party data submission Health IT\nModules to meet CMS reporting requirements, and to support data extraction for registry\nreporting for participation in CMS programs such as MIPS. Commenters noted that while in\nsome cases the extraction of data using a QRDA may also support other use cases – for example\nfor a registry – because of the specificity of the criteria to the CMS eCQMs, such a transaction\nusing the certified functionality is primarily for CMS reporting. Commenters noted the use of the\nCMS QRDA IG does not impede use of the data for other purposes. Finally, commenters noted\nthat ONC should continue to provide health IT developers the flexibility to offer a non-certified\nQRDA functionality that could support eCQMs beyond those included for CMS programs. One\ncommenter observed that while some health IT systems also provide tools for internal quality\nperformance monitoring, those tools often do not rely on the generation of QRDA exports.\n\nSome commenters reported that the technical support of multiple versions of QRDA\nstandards is unnecessary. Other commenters recommended maintaining only the HL7 standard or\n\n\n\n\noffering certification to the HL7 standard as an optional alternative to the CMS QRDA IG. One\ncommenter who recommended maintaining both the HL7 standard and the CMS QRDA IGs\nsuggested that ONC cite the CMS version(s) of the QRDA IG as a technical resource in the same\nmanner the C-CDA companion guide is cited for the transition of care criteria and only require\ncertifying to the HL7 version. These commenters agreed that developers should not have to\ncertify to both HL7 QRDA and CMS QRDA IGs, but suggested if a developer passed\ncertification for the CMS QRDA IGs, they should be deemed to have achieved certification to\nthe HL7 QRDA standard as well. Commenters noted that the CMS QRDA apply specifications\nto the HL7 QRDA to support CMS eCQM reporting requirements.\n\nOther commenters specifically stated that the HL7 QRDA should remain as an optional\ncertification criterion, since other organizations (e.g., certain hospital accreditation organizations\nsuch as The Joint Commission) use the HL7 QRDA, and there is need to assure the same style\nfor submission across programs. They recommended that the HL7 QRDA IG persist as a\ncontinuing option in the Program to enhance alignment with other standards and C-CDA, and to\nencourage a base standard alignment across implementers such as CMS and The Joint\nCommission. They stated that citing only to the CMS QRDA IG may lead to misalignment with\nthe base standards and reduce incentives to update the base standard.\n\nSome commenters expressed concern over the proposed removal of HL7 QRDA\nstandards from the original 2015 Edition CQMs, stating it may undermine private sector efforts\nto self-regulate and stated that the removal of the HL7 QRDA may not achieve the envisioned\nburden reduction through the mere elimination of developers’ need to certify and maintain\nmultiple standards. While some commenters suggested that removing HL7 QRDA from the\ncertification criteria could simplify the reporting process by recognizing the widespread use of\nCMS’ QRDA IGs, they noted that the HL7 QRDA is currently the standard for most EHR\n\n\n\n\nsystems and questioned how ONC proposed to implement this change given the prominence of\nHL7 standards in EHR systems. Several commenters noted that the disconnect between what the\ncertification testing required, and how the standard was really being used in the industry\n(primarily but not exclusively to meet the CMS QRDA IG) created unnecessary certification\ntesting burden, and asserted that the adoption of the CMS proprietary IG was more appropriate\nthan to maintain HL7 QRDA.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support for the proposal and comments\nregarding the versions of standards. We understand the concerns expressed in opposition to this\nproposal, and we appreciate specifically the identification of potential risk for the elimination of\nthe HL7 standard as applicable for other use cases. As noted previously, since the 2015 Edition\nfinal rule was published (October 16, 2015), we have gained received feedback from the industry\nthat health IT certified to the “CQMs – report” criterion (§ 170.315(c)(3)) are only or primarily\nbeing used to submit eCQMs to CMS for participation in CMS’ programs. In addition, we note\nthat while the HL7 QRDA may be used for other purposes, the “CQMs – report” criterion (§\n170.315(c)(3)) is specific to the CMS eCQMs specified for participation in CMS reporting\nprograms and no other eCQMs are tested under that criterion. This specificity applies not only to\nthe current 2015 Edition “CQMs – report” criterion, but also to the other 2015 Edition CQM\ncriteria and the prior 2014 Edition CQM criteria. This specificity is intended to provide\nassurances through testing and certification of the accuracy and standardization of CMS program\nmeasures across platforms, while recognizing that it would not be possible to specifically test to\nthe entire universe of potential eCQMs in use by health care providers. Because of this\ndependency, testing and certification of both the HL7 QRDA for CQMs-report and the CMS\nQRDA IG is redundant to support eCQM data reporting.\n\nThis has a dual impact on our considerations to finalize our proposal to require only the\n\n\n\n\nCMS QRDA IG. First, for use cases that are not related to CMS eCQM reporting, the certified\nfunctionality would not specifically support third party non-CMS eCQM reporting requirements,\nand so the modification to the functionality does not change the inability to use the certified\nversion of the functionality for such purposes. Second, for those use cases involving registries or\nother third parties that are implementing or supporting CMS eCQM reporting, use of the CMS\nQRDA IG could additionally support such purposes. In addition, we are not restricting health IT\ndevelopers from creating and providing to customers a non-certified functionality that supports\nthe HL7 QRDA for the extraction of data for eCQMs that are not CMS eCQMs. We note that\nthis is not a change from the prior policy allowing such flexibility. The prior certification for the\nQRDA IG included testing of CMS eCQMs only and it neither supported nor restricted any\ndevelopment of a QRDA functionality for non-CMS eCQMs.\n\nWe also agree that this approach will support closer alignment between the testing to the\nCMS QRDA IG specifications for a certified health IT module and the technical requirements for\nCMS program reporting. As part of the development of the CMS QRDA IGs, CMS strives to use\nthe annual update process to resolve issues with CQMs based on updates to clinical guidelines\nand to advance the requirements as the standard for reporting eCQM data matures. In this way,\naligning the criterion to the CMS program requirements that it specifically supports allows for\nalignment between these efforts as well as allowing for continued updates through the standards\nversion advancement process. We also believe our finalized proposal will not impede private\nsector initiatives as the CMS IGs support the continued efforts by public/private collaboration\nthrough standards developing organizations (SDOs) to refine standards.\n\nTherefore, as a means of reducing burden, we have finalized our proposal to remove the\nHL7 QRDA standard requirements from the 2015 Edition CQMs – report criterion in §\n170.315(c)(3). We maintain our position that this would directly reduce burden on health IT\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers and indirectly for health care providers as there would no longer be a requirement to\ndevelop and support two forms of the QRDA standard. We note that this does not preclude\ndevelopers from continuing to support the underlying standard, especially where such standard\nmay support reporting or health information exchange for other quality or public health purposes.\n\nInstead, we are simply not requiring testing and certification of any such standards, thereby\neliminating testing and certification burden from a criterion that is at this time scoped to the\npurpose of reporting for CMS quality programs.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters did not support the proposal but instead recommended\nthat CMS adopt the HL7 QRDA standard and do away with its own. However, several\ncommenters offered suggestions to CMS on the development of the CMS QRDA IG and the\nalignment to the HL7 QRDA standard. A number of commenters noted the National Technology\nTransfer and Advancement Act of 1995 principle that Federal agencies are generally required to\nuse technical standards that are developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies rather than a\nproprietary standard specific to an HHS program. Commenters also stated if CMS wanted to\nretain certain aspects of its standard, it should work with HL7 to get these vetted, balloted and\napproved for inclusion within the HL7 standard. Commenters also recommended working with\nSDOs or other organizations to sufficiently support CMS QRDA IGs. Some commenters\nsuggested that consolidation of QRDA standards would be more likely result in reducing\nprovider burdens than what ONC proposed.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their recommendations to improve the CMS\nQRDA IGs, or for CMS to work toward including the aspects of CMS QRDA IGs that they\nrequire for their program operations in SDO-balloted and approved consensus standards. Specific\nsuggestions for CMS IG development are outside the scope of this rule. ONC had previously\nincluded the HL7 QRDA standards for certification in the 2015 Edition in order to potentially\n\n\n\n\nsupport a broader range of use cases than reporting for CMS programs. However, the specificity\nof the criterion to the CMS eCQMs limits the utility of the certified functionality beyond use\nwith CMS eCQMs and as stated in the Proposed Rule, since the 2015 Edition final rule, ONC\nand CMS received significant stakeholder feedback that health IT modules certified to the\n“CQMs – report” criteria at 170.314(c)(3) in the 2014 Edition and 170.315(c)(3) for the 2015\nEdition are used only or primarily for reporting to CMS programs. While we reiterate that these\ncomments are outside the scope of this rule, we will continue to take this and other feedback into\nconsideration and will continue to work with CMS, standards developing organizations, and\nhealth IT industry partners to explore the concerns raised in relation to reducing burden and\npromoting interoperable standards for quality reporting.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters provided mixed feedback on whether the updated 2015 Edition\n“CQMs – report” criterion should require adherence to both CMS QRDA IGs, specifically the\n2019 CMS QRDA I IG for Hospital Quality Reporting48\nand the 2019 CMS QRDA III IG for\nEligible Clinicians and Eligible Professionals.49\nThe majority of commenters recommended that\nto reduce burden, ONC should consider a certification approach that permits developers to seek\ncertifications based on the care setting(s) their health IT modules are intended serve. For\nexample, commenters suggested that ONC should only require certification to the 2019 QRDA I\nIG for Hospital Quality Reporting if a Health IT Module is designed exclusively for the reporting\nof hospital measures, and only require certification to the 2019 QRDA III IG for Eligible\nClinicians and Eligible Professionals when a Health IT Module is designed exclusively for the\nreporting of ambulatory measures. In instances in which both populations are served, the\ndeveloper would then seek certification to both standards. Commenters suggested this approach\n48\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/system/files/QRDA_HQR_2019_CMS_IG_final_508.pdf\n49\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/system/files/2019_CMS_QRDA_III_Eligible_Clinicians_and_EP_IG-508.pdf\n\n\n\n\nwould avoid the unnecessary burden of certifying to a standard that the Health IT Module was\nnot intended to serve. Other commenters stated that the certification requirements should ensure\nthat certified Health IT Modules can support quality measure reporting by all potential users,\nespecially given the potential expansion of eligible participants in certain CMS programs (e.g.,\nshould a program expand from hospital-based only to include ambulatory measures). These\ncommenters recommended the adoption of a requirement for certified Health IT Modules to\ncalculate and export both CMS QRDA I patient-level reports for Hospital Quality Reporting and\nCMS QRDA III aggregate summary reports for Eligible Clinicians and Eligible Professionals.\n\nThese commenters noted that if a certified Health IT Module can only send an aggregate report\nwithout a patient level report, then this would greatly diminish the ability to verify the underlying\ncalculations. However, commenters recommended that ONC clarify that the transition to CMS\nQRDA I IG-based reports (patient-level, QRDA I IG for Hospital Quality Reporting) does not\nnecessarily mean that a hospital quality measure must be certified by any system (i.e. an\nambulatory Health IT Module can certify to only CMS QRDA III IG requirements). Commenters\nalso sought clarity that the transition to QRDA III reports (aggregate-level, IG for Eligible\nClinicians and Eligible Professionals) does not necessarily mean that an ambulatory quality\nmeasure must be certified by any system (i.e. a hospital system can certify to only hospital\nmeasures). Finally, one commenter noted that certifying ambulatory quality measures for the\nQRDA I to a hospital IG is not effective and will interfere with the use case of using QRDA I to\ncombine data between multiple ambulatory systems such as for group reporting.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their comments regarding whether a Health IT\nModule should be certified to both CMS QRDA IG standards or whether to consider an approach\nthat permits certification to only one of the standards depending on the care setting for which the\nHealth IT Module is designed and implemented. We agree with commenters that our certification\n\n\n\n\napproach should prevent unintended burden by tailoring the requirements to the type of measures\nbeing tested. This would mean that for the updated certification criterion “ CQMs – report” in §\n170.315(c)(3) a Health IT Module testing only ambulatory measures would test only with the\nCMS QRDA III IG for ambulatory measures and a Health IT Module testing only inpatient\nmeasures would test only with the QRDA I CMS IG for inpatient measures. A Health IT Module\nsupporting both ambulatory and inpatient measures would be required to test to both the CMS\nQRDA I IG and the CMS QRDA III IG. We clarify that testing for the 2015 Edition “CQM –\ncapture and export” criterion in § 170.315(c)(1) criteria includes demonstrating the capability to\nexport a QRDA I report specific to the eCQM being tested – which would support use case noted\nby the commenter to combine data across multiple ambulatory systems. We have not proposed\nand have not finalized a change to the 2015 Edition “CQM – capture and export” criterion in §\n170.315(c)(1). We further note that health IT developers may leverage QRDA file formats for a\nwide range of use cases and that our inclusion of the CMS QRDA I and QRDA III IGs does not\nprohibit the use of the QRDA standard for any other purpose. As noted above, we have finalized\nthe adoption of the CMS QRDA IGs for the “CQMs – report” criterion in § 170.315(c)(3) for\nwhich the Health IT Module is presented for certification.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the proposal to adopt the latest CMS\nQRDA IGs at the time of final rule publication, as CMS updates their QRDA IGs annually to\nsupport the latest eCQM specifications and only accepts eCQM reporting to the latest version.\n\nHowever, a few commenters recommended that ONC monitor this part of the certification\nprocess for unintended consequences since CMS’ IGs are updated on a yearly basis. Some\ncommenters noted that given the lack of alignment with timing, eCQM measures and standards\nwill continue to lack testing. Other commenters recommended the IGs be updated in alignment\nwith updates to the certification standards. A few commenters requested clarification of the\n\n\n\n\neffective dates and asked ONC to evaluate and propose a timeline for the implementation of an\nalignment between the programs. In addition, commenters asked for clarification on whether\nONC will propose penalties for providers who may be unable to meet the timeline if it is\ninsufficient.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and have adopted the latest CMS QRDA\nIG versions available at the time of publication of this final rule. For details on the latest CMS\nQRDA IGs, we refer readers to the CMS QRDA I Implementation Guide for Hospital Quality\nReporting and CMS QRDA III Implementation Guide for Eligible Clinicians and Eligible\nProfessionals available on the eCQI Resource Center website.50\nWe note that CMS updates the\nCMS eCQMs on an annual basis as well as the CMS QRDA IGs for reporting to CMS programs.\n\nAs in prior years going back to the 2014 Edition, HHS will continue to update the Cypress\ntesting tool to support health IT developer testing to the most recent annual update. We note that\nCMS has previously required that EHR technology used for eCQM reporting be certified to all\neCQMs but does not need to be recertified each time it is updated to a more recent version of the\neCQM electronic specifications, unless the EHR technology is supporting new eCQMs or\nfunctionality (such as the “CQM – filter” criterion in § 170.315(c)(4)) (84 FR 42505). This\napproach allows for continued updates to and testing of eCQMs while minimizing the burden on\ndevelopers and providers to support those updates in time for each annual performance period.\n\nFinally, we note that ONC has no authority to set requirements, incentives, or penalties for health\ncare providers related to the use of health IT, and we direct readers to CMS for information on\nhealth IT requirements in CMS programs.\n\n50\nThe Electronic Clinical Quality Improvement (eCQI) Resource Center. CMS QRDA I Implementation Guide for\nHospital Quality Reporting and CMS QRDA III Implementation Guide for Eligible Clinicians and Eligible\nProfessionals. Available at: https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qrda.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters agreed with ONC’s assessment in the Proposed\nRule that quality reporting is not yet ready to transition to FHIR and that more testing and\nvalidation of FHIR is needed before requiring a new API-based reporting functionality as a part\nof the Program. Some commenters supported the adoption of FHIR Release 4-enabled APIs as a\nreplacement for QRDA-based reports, but stated that published documentation aligning HL7 C-\nCDA, QRDA, and/or FHIR standards to CMS’ “Quality Data Model51\n,” which is an information\nmodel that defines relationships between patients and clinical concepts in a standardized format\nto enable electronic quality performance measurement and that would allow for more consistent\neCQM reporting and improved interoperability in clinical quality feedback between health\nsystems and data registries. Other commenters stated that FHIR standards will likely strengthen\nstandardized data element availability and flexibility to improve the types of eCQMs that may be\ndeveloped, and suggested that CMS continue to work with the National Quality Forum, measure\nstewards, and measure developers to advance both existing evidence-based measures (e.g., either\nadministrative or hybrid measures) and evolving outcome measures that utilize population-based\nelectronic clinical data.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. We believe there are potential benefits\nto be gained by exploring both near-term, program specific implementations of APIs to support\ncurrent quality reporting submission mechanisms such as for CMS eCQM reporting as well as\nthe long-term potential to reimagine quality measurement by leveraging API technologies. We\nbelieve that these technology approaches could help providers and payers, including CMS, move\nfrom the current approach, in which providers are required to calculate and submit results on\nspecific quality measures, to one in which payers, including CMS, could obtain clinical data for\n51\nhttps://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm\n\n\n\n\nquality measurement directly through an API. This could potentially include the ability to obtain\nclinical data for a defined group or sample set of patients to assess quality across patient\npopulations, as well as to compare clinical data for patients over time to assess quality impacts\nthrough longitudinal measurement. We believe emerging innovative standards are now available\nto support such models, specifically the ability to respond with clinical data for a defined group\nor sample set of patients using the bulk data capabilities in FHIR Release 4. We note that\nreadiness for such an approach, both for recipients of quality data and for health IT developers\nsupporting quality improvement solutions, is not yet mature for adoption of such a criterion in\nthe Program. However, we are committed to continuing to work with HHS partners, health care\nproviders, health IT developers and SDOs to explore the potential for such solutions in the\nfuture.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended additional changes not considered in the\nProposed Rule. For example, one commenter recommended ONC require that to be certified in §\n170.315(c)(1) “CQMs – record and export,” § 170.315(c)(2), “CQMs – import and calculate,”\nand § 170.315(c)(3) “CQMs – report,” a Health IT Module be certified in a minimum of 9\neCQMs instead of one eCQM and that the § 170.315(c)(1) criterion should require the ability to\nexport all patients for a given eCQM. Currently, the ability to export a QRDA I file can be\nlimited to one patient at a time. Commenters noted that this limitation defeats the purpose of data\ninteroperability and does not advance the goals of ONC to increase access to data and the\ninteroperability of Health IT Modules. And another commenter recommended that, in addition to\nthe adoption of the CMS IGs under the § 170.315(c)(3) criterion, that the CMS IGs replace the\ncorresponding HL7 QRDA IGs as ONC’s Program standard under the § 170.315(c)(1) criterion\n(which currently references QRDA I exclusively) and § 170.315(c)(2) criterion (which currently\nreferences only QRDA I as standard, but also involves use of QRDA III for purposes of\n\n\n\n\nverifying appropriate calculation of measures from imported QRDAs).\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for input and clarifications. While we appreciate\ncomments suggesting changes to § 170.315(c)(1) “CQMs – record and export,” and §\n170.315(c)(2) “CQMs – import and calculate,” the recommended changes are outside the scope\nof our proposal. Therefore, while we may consider these recommendations for future Program\nrulemaking, we have not adopted the suggested changes to § 170.315(c)(1) “CQMs – record and\nexport,” or § 170.315(c)(2) “CQMs – import and calculate in this final rule.\n\nAs noted previously, we have finalized the update to the “CQMs – report” criterion in §\n170.315(c)(3) to require that health IT developers use the CMS QRDA IG appropriate to the\nmeasures being submitted for testing and certification to read as follows: “Clinical quality\nmeasures – report. Enable a user to electronically create a data file for transmission of clinical\nquality measurement data in accordance with the applicable implementation specifications\nspecified by the CMS implementation guides for Quality Reporting Document Architecture\n(QRDA), category I, for inpatient measures in § 170.205(h)(3) and CMS QRDA, category III,\nfor ambulatory measures in § 170.205(k)(3).”\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed to adopt a new 2015 Edition certification criterion referred to as “EHI\nExport” in § 170.315(b)(10). The criterion’s conformance requirements were intended to support\ntwo contexts in which we believed that all EHI produced and electronically managed by a\ndeveloper’s technology should be made readily available for export as a capability of certified\nhealth IT. First, we proposed in § 170.315(b)(10)(i) at 84 FR 7447 that health IT certified to this\ncriterion would support single patient EHI export upon a valid request by a patient or a user on\nthe patient’s behalf. Second, we proposed in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii) at 84 FR 7447 that the\nproposed criterion would support the export of all EHI when a health care provider chooses to\n\n\n\n\ntransition or migrate information to another health IT system. Third, we proposed in §\n170.315(b)(10)(iii) that the export format(s) used to support the exports must be made available\nvia a publicly accessible hyperlink, including keeping the hyperlink up-to-date with the current\nexport format.\n\nAt the time of the Proposed Rule, we indicated our belief that this proposed certification\ncriterion provided a useful first step toward enabling patients to have electronic access to their\nEHI and equipping health care providers with better tools to transition patient EHI to another\nhealth IT system. We noted that this criterion would create a baseline capability for exporting\nEHI. We requested comments regarding the proposed single patient EHI export and the proposed\ndatabase export functionalities, as well as the proposed scope of data export and other criterion\nelements throughout the Proposed Rule section at 84 FR 7447 through 7449.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported the intent of the proposed “EHI export”\ncriterion to advance the access, exchange, and use of EHI. Commenters in favor of the criterion\nand its proposed conformance requirements stated that it would foster innovative export\ncapabilities and inform areas where additional standards development could be needed. We also\nreceived a variety of comments asking for adjustments to proposed requirements. A majority of\ncommenters requested revisions to the criterion, including calling for a defined set of data\nelements for export and specific data transport standards. Many commenters offered\nrecommended standards or requested that we provide specific standards to reduce variation.\n\nThese commenters indicated that no defined standard could lead to broad interpretation and\npotential inadequacies of the data export. Some commenters expressed a medical record keeping\nconcern that the proposed standards-agnostic approach for the export functionality could be\nproblematic, stating that the export could create a dissonance if the EHI renders health record\ncontent in a form or format that is different from what a provider produces or utilizes as output.\n\n\n\n\nOther commenters opposed the adoption of this proposed criterion. These commenters expressed\nconcern that later implementation of standards, such as APIs, would make developers invest time\nand funding into the proposed requirements only for the work to be discarded in the future.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback on the proposed “EHI export”\ncriterion at 84 FR 7446 of the Proposed Rule (§ 170.315(b)(10)). We have considered\ncommenters’ concerns, support, and recommendations and adopted a revised version of this\ncertification criterion. This final certification criterion is designed to align with section 4006(a)\nof the Cures Act, which requires the Secretary, in consultation with the National Coordinator, to\npromote policies that ensure that a patient’s EHI is accessible to that patient and the patient’s\ndesignees, in a manner that facilitates communication with the patient’s health care providers and\nother individuals (84 FR 7447). In addition, this criterion complements other provisions that\nsupport patients’ access to their EHI and health care providers use of EHI, such as the secure,\nstandard-based API certification criterion (proposed in 84 FR 7427 and finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)), and also supports longitudinal data record development. Therefore, we have\nfinalized the criterion with revisions. Notably, in response to comments on this criterion and the\nproposed information blocking policies, we have adopted a focused definition of EHI in §\n170.102 and § 171.102. For context purposes, the EHI definition is focused on “electronic\nprotected health information as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 to the extent that it would be\nincluded in a designated record set as defined in 45 CFR 164.501” with additional caveats not\nrepeated here for briefness. Put simply, the EHI definition represents the same ePHI that a\npatient would have the right to request a copy of pursuant to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This is a\nregulatory concept with which the industry has nearly 20 years of familiarity. Health IT\ndevelopers’ customer base includes health care providers who are HIPAA covered entities, and\nin many cases developers serve as HIPAA business associates to their covered-entity customers.\n\n\n\n\nThus, health IT developers should be accustomed to identifying ePHI so that their products\nsupport appropriately securing it, the fulfillment of patient access requests, and the identification\nand reporting on breaches. They should, therefore, be well prepared to identify what EHI their\nproduct(s) would need to export in order to support a patient’s HIPAA right of access. The\nfinalized criterion requires a certified Health IT Module to include export capabilities for a single\npatient (§ 170.315(b)(10)(i)) and patient population (§ 170.315(b)(10)(ii)) related to EHI. More\nspecifically, the export(s) will need to include the EHI that can be stored at the time of\ncertification by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part. We emphasize that such\n“stored” data applies to all EHI and is agnostic as to whether the EHI is stored in or by the\ncertified Health IT Module or in or by any of the other “non-certified” capabilities of the health\nIT product of which the certified Health IT Module is a part. The scope of EHI applies across the\nproduct as a whole as a means to further promote the access, exchange, and use of EHI for the\nuse cases required to be supported by this certification criterion. The finalized scope of data\nincluded in the criterion export is discussed in greater detail under the “Scope of Data Export”\n\n(IV.B.6.c) section below.\n\nWhile the data that must be exported has been more specifically scoped, the certification\ncriterion does not require a specific standard format be used for the purposes of representing the\nexported EHI. We also modified the certification criterion’s documentation requirements in §\n170.315(b)(10)(iii) to be more concise. As finalized, the documentation required for the export\nformat(s) used to support (b)(10)(i) and (ii) functionality must be kept up-to-date and made\navailable via a publicly accessible hyperlink. Additional information is included under “Export\nFormat” below.\n\nWe appreciate the comments received regarding the specific data sets and data\ntransmission standards for this certification criterion. We reiterate that the finalized certification\n\n\n\n\ncriterion is specific to EHI, as defined, that can be stored at the time of certification by the\nproduct, of which the Health IT Module is part, and is not limited to a predefined data set or to\nspecific data transmission standards. Developers are required to ensure the health IT products\nthey present for certification are capable of exporting all of the EHI that can be stored at the time\nof certification by the product. We acknowledge that the amount of EHI exported and format in\nwhich such EHI is represented will differ by developer and products of which certified Health IT\nModules are a part. Each product presented for certification, of which the Health IT Module is a\npart, will likely vary in the amount of EHI it can store. As a result, the amount of EHI that will\nneed to be able to be exported in order to demonstrate conformance with this certification\ncriterion will vary widely because of the diversity of products presented for certification. For\nexample, small software components only capable of storing a certain scope of EHI (and only\ncertified to a few certification criteria) will only need to be able to export that stored EHI in order\nto meet this certification criterion. In contrast, a more comprehensive product with an EHI\nstorage scope well beyond all of the adopted certification criteria would by its nature need to\ndemonstrate it could export a lot more EHI. But even in this latter case, it is important to note\nthat while that scope of EHI may be comprehensive for that product, it may still not be all of the\nhealth information for which a health care provider is the steward and that meets the EHI\ndefinition within the health IT products deployed within their organization. In other words, a\nhealth IT user may have other health IT systems with no connection to the Certification Program\nthat store EHI and such EHI would still be in scope from an information blocking perspective.\n\nWe note all of these distinctions to make clear for and to dissuade readers from jumping to an\nimproper conclusion that the EHI export criterion in the Certification Program is a substitute for\nor equivalent to the EHI definition for the purposes of information blocking. We direct readers to\nthe information blocking section (VIII) for additional information. Unless a health care provider\n\n\n\n\n(which is an “actor” regulated by the information blocking provision) only used a single health\nIT product to store EHI that was also certified to this certification criterion, the EHI definition\nwill always be larger. Regardless of the amount of EHI each product has within its scope to\nexport, the purpose of this certification criterion is to make the EHI already available in such\nhealth IT products more easily available for access, exchange, and use by patients and their\nproviders, which is a fundamental principle established by the Cures Act.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, and as stated in the Proposed Rule at 84 FR 7447,\nthis criterion may not be needed in the future. However, the comments suggesting we not adopt\nthis certification criterion at all because it will be outmoded at some point in the future did not\nappear to acknowledge that all technology is eventually replaced for a variety of reasons. We too\nlook forward to a day where standards-based APIs are the predominant method for enabling\nelectronic health information to be accessed, exchanged, and used. We strongly encourage\nindustry partners to engage in their own consortiums, with ONC and other Federal agencies, and\nother stakeholders in the health IT ecosystem to advance standards development, prototypes, and\npilot testing in order to ultimately build a body of evidence that could accelerate the adoption and\nimplementation timeline of technology that could either add more structure to or remove the\nneed for this certification criterion in the future. However, we do not accept the promise of this\nfuture state as a reason to simply wait, nor do we believe that the potential of this future justifies\ndelaying the incremental progress the industry can make. In this case, had we followed such\ncommenters direction, we would be withholding from patients and health care providers the\ncertainty that there would be technical capabilities within a defined time that could be used to\nenable the access, exchange, and use of EHI. We note that suggestions by commenters to\nstructure the certification criterion to only move information within specific data sets or via\nspecific standards-based export functionality would delay the ability of patients and users of\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT to access, exchange, and use the information they need and would run counter to the\nunderlying principles supporting this certification criterion – that the electronic health\ninformation should be accessible for access, exchange, and use. For this reason, we have not\nincluded specific data set or export requirements in this certification criterion as some\ncommenters suggested.\n\nIn consideration of comments, the finalized “EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) is\nnot included in the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, which is a modification from what we\nproposed. We revised the policy in recognition of comments received, including comments\nregarding the structure and scope of the criterion as proposed and the development burden of the\ncriterion. As finalized here, we believe that including this certification criterion in the Conditions\nand Maintenance of Certification is the best place to include the requirement associated with the\ncriterion. Thus, we have finalized the § 170.315(b)(10) certification criterion as a general\ncertification requirement for the ONC Health IT Certification Program, and have not included it\nin the 2015 Edition Base EHR Definition.\n\nIn general, we also note that those who use Health IT Module(s) certified to the “EHI\nexport” criterion remain responsible for safeguarding the security and privacy of individuals’\nEHI consistent with applicable laws and regulations related to health information privacy and\nsecurity, including the HITECH Act, HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 42 CFR part 2, and\nState laws. The existence of a technical capability to make EHI more accessible and useable by\nHealth IT Module users does not alter or change any of their data protection responsibilities\nunder applicable laws and regulations.\n\n*Comments.* Comments received included concerns with the development and use of the\ncertification criterion. Some commenters expressed support for the criterion’s overall flexibility\nbut cautioned ONC to be realistic regarding the goals and expectations for the certification\n\n\n\n\ncriterion. These commenters also expressed concern that the proposed certification criterion\nwould result in development for an ambiguous scope of data export and would divert from work\nneeded to achieve other interoperability goals. Other commenters stated concerns that\ndevelopment costs could potentially be passed onto health IT users, such as health care\nproviders. These commenters also anticipated use and implementation challenges for users that\nwork with multiple systems.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for sharing their concerns. In regards to the use of the\ncapabilities required by this certification criterion, we interpreted from comments some\nconfusion related to potential “users” of the health IT. As previously defined under the Program,\n“user” is a health care professional or their office staff; or a software program or service that\nwould interact directly with the certified health IT (80 FR 62611, 77 FR 54168).\n\nWe also appreciate the comments and concerns regarding the potential development\nburden that could result to meet the requirements of the proposed criterion. In consideration of\nthose expressed concerns, we have narrowed the scope of data that must be exported. This more\nfocused scope should measurably reduce the stated ambiguity by commenters and development\nburden for health IT developers in contrast to what was proposed (84 FR 7448). We appreciate\nthe concerns expressed for the potential user(s) of Health IT Modules, but note that the\ncertification criterion is designed to advance the electronic movement of data out of a product\nwhile factoring in the current variability in health IT. As always, we encourage developers to\nseek innovative and expedient capabilities that, at minimum, meet the requirements of the\ncertification criterion, as well as the developing needs of their health IT users.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters provided alternative ideas for the criterion specific to USCDI.\n\nSome recommended amending the criterion to require the specific structure and applicable\nstandards for USCDI elements, or starting this criterion with a minimum of USCDI data\n\n\n\n\nelements. Several commenters recommended expanding the existing 2015 Edition “data export”\ncriterion to include USCDI in lieu of the proposed “EHI export” criterion.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for sharing these ideas. We have finalized the “EHI\nexport” criterion as described above. Our intent under this finalized criterion is to advance export\nfunctionality for single patient and patient population EHI exports, while leaving flexibility in\nregard to format and without assigning specific data sets due to the different scopes of data that\nhealth IT may include. Toward those ends, limiting the scope of this certification criterion to\nsolely the data represented by the USCDI would make it no different than other USCDI bounded\ncertification criteria already adopted and would not advance the policy interests we have\nexpressed. In regards to comments on the existing 2015 Edition “data export” criterion (§\n170.315(b)(6)), we refer readers to our discussion of the criterion below.\n\n*Comments.* Some comments expressed confusion and asked for guidance on how this\ncertification criterion would apply to health IT that is no longer certified. Commenters also asked\nfor guidance on how this criterion applies to other systems that interact with Health IT Modules\ncertified to this criterion based on the proposed scope of data for export.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for requesting clarification. We first clarify that the\nexport functionality under this certification criterion applies to Health IT Modules presented for\ncertification under the Program. More specifically, if a health IT developer presents for\ncertification a health IT product of which a Health IT Module is a part and the product\nelectronically stores EHI, certification to § 170.315(b)(10) is required. As noted in our response\nabove, this would include the EHI that can be stored at the time of certification by the product, of\nwhich the Health IT Module is a part. This includes all EHI stored by the product’s certified and\n“non-certified” capabilities. For example, if a health IT product includes a component(s) that is\npresented for certification and that component stores EHI, then that EHI must be made available\n\n\n\n\nfor export, in accordance with § 170.315(b)(10). Importantly, the scope of data required to be\nexported in accordance with § 170.315(b)(10) includes only to the EHI that can be stored at the\ntime of certification by the product. We emphasize that such “stored” data applies to all EHI and\nis agnostic as to whether the EHI is stored in or by the certified Health IT Module or in or by any\nof the other “non-certified” capabilities of the health IT product of which the certified Health IT\nModule is a part. The scope of EHI applies across the product as a whole as a means to further\npromote the access, exchange, and use of EHI for the use cases required to be supported by this\ncertification criterion.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "As part of this criterion, we proposed a functionality for single patient EHI export at 84\nFR 7447 which would enable a user of certified health IT to timely create an export file(s), with\nthe proposed scope of data export of all of the EHI the health IT product produces and\nelectronically manages on a single patient. The functionality would also require a user to be able\nto execute this capability at any time the user chooses and without subsequent developer\nassistance to operate. In addition, we proposed that health IT certified to this criterion would be\nrequired to enable the ability to limit the users who could create such export file(s) in at least one\nof two ways: to a specific set of identified users, and (2) as a system administrative function. We\nalso proposed that the export file(s) created must be electronic and in a computable format and\nthat the export file(s) format, including its structure and syntax, must be included with the\nexported file(s).\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in support of the proposal for single patient\nexport to support patient access under the certification criterion. The majority of these\ncommenters provided recommended revisions, including suggested transmission formats and\ndata export content standards. Some commenters recommended the addition of this certification\n\n\n\n\ncriterion to the list of criteria subject to real world testing.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We have finalized the single patient\nexport functionality in § 170.315(b)(10)(i) with some modifications. We finalized a focused data\nexport scope, which applies to the data expected to be available for export under the single\npatient export capability. We defined the scope of data that needs to be exported to EHI that can\nbe stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part.\n\nThus, we have modified the title of § 170.315(b)(10)(i) to “single patient electronic health\ninformation export” to reflect the scope of this data export. We finalized that the capability for a\nuser to execute a single patient export must be able to be limited at least one of two ways: to a\nspecific set of identified users, and as a system administrative function. While we finalized as\nproposed in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(D) that the export files must be electronic and in a computable\nformat, we modified in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii)(E) that the publicly accessible hyperlink of the\nexport’s format must be included with the exported file(s). This modification clarifies that the\nuser is able to access the format, and that the developer will keep their hyperlink up-to-date.\n\nWe appreciate commenter’s recommendations for specific data transmission formats and\ndata content standards, and considered the range of recommendations when developing the\nfinalized scope of data export required for this criterion. We believe the definition of EHI as\nfocused in § 171.102, as well as the modifications to the scope of data export, addresses the data\nambiguity concerns received by commenters. We direct readers to our detailed discussion of the\nscope of data export below. As finalized, the certification criterion’s export, for both single and\npatient population EHI Export, remain standards-agnostic. We believe that the finalized\ncertification criterion will serve as an initial step towards increased access, exchange, and use of\nelectronically available data. We will continue working alongside industry stakeholders and will\nrevisit export strategies as standards continue to develop and mature. We appreciate confirmation\n\n\n\n\nthat commenters support inclusion of the criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) alongside the rest of the\ncare coordination criteria in § 170.315(b), and have finalized that this certification criterion is\npart of the real world testing Condition of Certification requirement.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters asked ONC to clarify how health IT developers may limit\nthe users’ ability to access and initiate the export function in § 170.315(b)(10)(i), and to include\nexamples of potential permissible and non-permissible behaviors.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments received. We again clarify that “user” is a health\ncare professional or their office staff; or a software program or service that would interact\ndirectly with the certified health IT (80 FR 62611, 77 FR 54168). In regards to questions on\npermissible behaviors for developers, the ability to limit the health IT users’ access to the single\npatient EHI export functionality in § 170.315(b)(10)(i) is intended to be used by and at the\ndiscretion of the organization implementing the technology. We reiterate that similar to the 2015\nedition “data export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(6), this cannot be used by health IT developers as\na way to thwart or moot the overarching user-driven aspect of this capability (80 FR 62646). We\ndo not wish to limit this functionality to specific permissible or non-permissible behaviors at this\ntime, but reaffirm in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(B) that a user must be able to execute the single patient\nEHI export capability at any time the user chooses and without subsequent developer assistance\nto operate. To be clear, the user must be able to execute the export without the intervention of the\ndeveloper. We also finalize, as proposed, in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(C) that this capability must limit\nthe ability of user who create such export files(s) in at least one of two ways; (1) to a specific set\nof identified users, and (2) as a system administrative function.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of comments received asked for further clarity on “timely”\nregarding a health IT user’s request to create an export file(s).\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the questions. We specify that “timely” means near\nreal-time, while being reasonable and prudent given the circumstances.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters also sought clarity on data in electronic health records that may\nbe shared between patients and possibly included in the export. These commenters asked if under\nthe proposed criterion, patients have a right to information about others that may be contained in\ntheir medical record.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for submitting these questions. In regards to shared\npatient data concerns, we note that the export functionality requirements apply to what a product\nwith a Health IT Module certified to this criterion must be able to do regardless of whether the\ndeveloper is operating the export for a health care provider or a health care provider is\nmaintaining and operating the technology in their own production environment. Under the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule, when a covered health care provider, in the course of treating an\nindividual, collects or otherwise obtains an individual’s family medical history, this information\nmay become part of the medical record for that individual and thus be included in the\n“designated record set” (defined at 45 CFR 164.501)). Thus, if the family medical history\nbecomes part of the designated record set, the individual/patient may exercise the right of access\n(45 CFR 164.524) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to this information in the same fashion as any\nother information in the medical record. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not prevent individuals,\nthemselves, from gathering medical information about their family members or from deciding to\nshare this information with family members or others, including their health care providers.\n\nThus, individuals are free to provide their doctors with a complete family medical history or\ncommunicate with their doctors about conditions that run in the family. To the degree that, for\nexample, Patient A’s medical record include that their mother had breast cancer, that information\nwould be accessible to Patient A because it was provided by Patient A and included as part of\n\n\n\n\ntheir medical record. Under this criterion, patients would not have a “right” to other patient’s\nrecords, consistent with existing laws. In general, with respect to patient access to information,\nwe note that Health IT Module users must ensure that any disclosures of data conform to all\napplicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to alignment between this rule and the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule, as discussed in IV.B.6 above. We also refer readers to the information\nblocking section at VIII in this preamble, as well.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarity on how ONC will monitor a developer’s\ncompliance with exporting in a timely manner and what penalties ONC will impose if there is a\ndelay in regards to a Health IT Module user’s request. Commenters requested ONC release sub-\nregulatory guidance that describes how users may file complaints and recommended ONC work\nwith the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on patient education.\n\n*Response.* Any noncompliance by developers with the finalized “EHI export”\ncertification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(10)) or the associated Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements (e.g., § 170.402(a)(4) and (b)(2)) would be subject to review,\ncorrective action, and enforcement procedures under the Program. We refer readers to the\nenforcement (VII) and information blocking (VIII) sections of this preamble for further\ninformation. We do not believe there is a general need to work with OCR further on this\nparticular issue or to issue further sub-regulatory guidance. The functionality of the “EHI export”\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(10) provides a user (e.g., a health care provider) with the ability to\nexport a file for a single patient and multiple patients. If a user or other stakeholder has concerns\nabout ongoing compliance of health IT certified to this criterion, with the required functionality\nof the criterion, or the associated Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, they\nmay file a complaint with the health IT developer, an ONC-ACB, or ONC.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters requested specific stakeholder exemptions from this\n\n\n\n\nrequirement, such as health plans.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the recommendations. We note that the “EHI\nexport” criterion is applicable only to health IT products presented by developers for certification\nunder the Program that meet the criterion and “Assurances” Condition of Certification\nrequirements in § 170.402. In addition, we note that the information subject to the export\nrequirements is EHI that can be stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the\nHealth IT Module is a part.\n\n\n",

We also recognized that in service to innovative and patient-centric\napproaches, a health IT developer could develop a method that allows a patient to execute the\nrequest for data export without needing a provider to do so on their behalf. Under this scenario,\nwe sought comments on whether the single patient export functionality should be made more\nprescriptive and require that the developers design the health IT to allow only the patient and\ntheir authorized representative to be the requestor of their EHI (84 FR 7447).\n\n*Comments.* In the scenario of patient-centric approaches created by developers, the\nmajority of commenters were in favor of developers designing the export capability to make the\npatient and their authorized representative able to be the direct requestors of their EHI without\nneeding a provider to execute this capability on their behalf. We also received recommended\nterms to further define “authorized representative” under this scenario. Several commenters\nadvised against specifying or restricting the potential additional user roles able to initiate a single\npatient export. Some commenters recommended additional requirements for developers,\nincluding requiring developers to create this capability to enable the patient or their “proxy” to\n\n\n\n\nrequest their information through and receive information from the patient’s health portal or an\napplication. Commenters asked for the final rule to include clarification on what the patient and\ntheir authorized representative can access. We did receive some comments that requested\nclarification of this potential approach. We also received comments expressing confusion with\nthe patient and authorized representative requests applying across the certification criterion, as\nopposed to the proposed and previously defined “users” of health IT that will typically perform\nthe request on behalf of a patient.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and requests for clarification. In response\nto the concerns and potential confusion, we clarify the following. This certification criterion does\nnot require “direct-to-patient” functionality in order to demonstrate conformance. Providing such\na capability and demonstrating conformance to this certification criterion with such a capability\nwould be at the sole discretion of the health IT developer. In general, just like with the “data\nexport” criterion in § 170.315(b)(6), the capability to execute this certification criterion can be\nhealth care provider/health care organization initiated (presumably upon that organization\nreceiving a request by patient for their EHI). In instances where the functionality certified to this\ncriterion is implemented in a “direct-to-patient” way such that the patient can request and accept\nEHI export without assistance from a user, we recognize that further configuration of the\nfunctionality or product in which it is implemented may be needed in order to account for\napplicable laws related to the patient’s information access rights and other privacy and\ninformation blocking policies that apply to the configuration and use of the Health IT Module.\n\nWhile this specific capability within the certification criterion emphasizes health IT developer\nassistance must not be needed to operate the export, we recognize that user assistance (e.g., a\nprovider) may be necessary to initiate such capability in the user’s product.\n\n\n",

We proposed that a health IT developer or health IT certified\nto this criterion must, at a user’s request, provide a complete export of all EHI that is produced or\nelectronically managed (84 FR 7447 through 7448) by means of the developer’s certified health\nIT.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in support of the functionality under this\ncriterion for transitions between health IT systems. Many commenters recommended format and\ncontent specifications, such as the use of bulk FHIR®-based APIs for export transmission. Some\ncommenters stressed that ONC should determine and require standards, as well as clarify the\nscope of data export specific to this use case. Some commenters expressed concerns, including\ngathering patient consent and the developer burden that may exist with gathering data from\ndisparate systems under the proposed scope terminology. One commenter was against the\ntransitions between health IT systems capability, citing that data structured for one system will\nnot necessarily work in another.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback specific to the functionality of\ntransitions between health IT systems under this criterion. We finalized this export functionality\nwith modifications. First, this functionality is now referred to as “patient population electronica\nhealth information export” in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii) to better reflect the policy intent of patient\ndata transitions in instances of providers switching health IT systems, and to reflect the finalized\nscope of data that a product with a certified Health IT Module must be capable of exporting.\n\nSimilar to the modifications in § 170.315(b)(10)(i), we finalized in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii)(A) that\nthe export files must be electronic and in a computable format and we modified in §\n170.315(b)(10)(ii)(B) that the publicly accessible hyperlink of the export’s format must be\n\n\n\n\nincluded with the exported file(s). This modification clarifies that the user is able to access the\nformat, and that the developer will keep their hyperlink up-to-date.\n\nIn response to comments on defining a separate scope of data export specific to the\npatient population export functionality, it is our final policy for this certification criterion to align\nboth the single patient and patient population export data to EHI, as defined in this rule, that can\nbe stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part. This\nnarrower scope also addressed concerns received regarding development burden expressed\nregarding gathering data from disparate systems under the proposed scope terminology.\n\nIn regards to the comments on enforcing format and standards for data transmission, it is\nour intent under this certification criterion that health IT developers have flexibility regarding\nhow the export outcome is achieved. We again encourage the industry to work together toward\nthis common goal and to create an industry-wide approach. We do acknowledge the comments\nreceived that data structured for one system may not necessarily seamlessly align with another,\nand refer commenters to the export format requirements of this certification criterion. As\nfinalized in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii)(A), the export created must be electronic and in a computable\nformat. In contrast with the single patient EHI export capability, which must be available to a\nuser without subsequent developer assistance to operate, the patient population EHI export\ncapability of this criterion could require action or support on the part of the health IT developer.\n\nWe acknowledged in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7448) that because of anticipated large volume\nof electronic health information that could be exported under this specific proposed capability,\ndeveloper action or support could be needed. Our thinking remains the same post-public\ncomments even with the narrowed scope of data export. While exporting one patient’s data on an\nas-needed basis is a capability that should be executable by a user on their own, orchestrating an\nentire export of EHI for migration to another health IT system is an entirely different task and\n\n\n\n\ndependent on a variety of factors such as the organization’s overall infrastructure and\ndeployment footprint. Additionally, developers of health IT certified to this criterion are required\nto provide the assurances in § 170.402, which include providing reasonable cooperation and\nassistance to other persons (including customers, users, and third-party developers) to enable the\nuse of interoperable products and services. Thus, while developers have flexibility regarding how\nthey implement the export functionality for transitions between systems, they are ultimately\nresponsible for ensuring that the capability is deployed in a way that enables a customer and their\nthird-party contractors to successfully migrate data. Such cooperation and assistance could\ninclude, for example, assisting a customer's third-party developer to automate the export of EHI\nto other systems. We refer readers to the export format section below for additional details.\n\nWe note that the narrowed scope of data that certified Health IT Modules must be\ncapable of exporting does not reduce contractual obligations of health IT developers to continue\nto support providers if they do want to change systems, and direct readers to the information\nblocking section (VIII) for additional information.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed in 84 FR 7448 and in § 170.315(b)(10) that for both use cases supported by\nthis criterion, the scope of data that the certified health IT product must be capable of exporting\nwould encompass all the EHI that the health IT system produces and electronically manages for\na patient or group of patients. Our intention was that “produces and electronically manages”\nwould include a health IT product’s entire database. In the Proposed Rule, our use of the term\nEHI was deliberate. At the time of rulemaking, the proposed definition of the EHI term in\n§ 171.102 was intended to support the consistency and breadth of the types of data envisioned by\nthis proposed criterion. We requested comment on the terminology used (“produces and\nelectronically manages”) or whether there were alternatives to the proposed language.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters were supportive of our proposed scope of data export\nrequirements, while a few others offered alternative specific terminology options. Those\ncommenters suggested terminology such as all EHI the health IT system “collects and retains,”\nor “produces or can electronically access, exchange, or use.” A majority of commenters,\nhowever, stated that the proposed terminology, including the proposed EHI definition, left broad\ninterpretations of the scope of data a Health IT Module would have to be capable of exporting\nunder this criterion. These commenters expressed concerns that the ambiguity and potentially\nvast amounts of data would create undue burden on health IT developers for development and\nupkeep of export capabilities, as well as compliance issues with other applicable laws. A\nmajority of commenters requested and highlighted a need for further specificity regarding the\nterminology used to define data exported under this criterion. Some commenters expressed\nconcerns that a developer presenting a Health IT Module for certification may not know all\nsystems a user may later connect to the health IT capabilities. We also received many comments\nreflecting varied thoughts on what should or should not be included in the criterion’s data export.\n\nSome commenters strongly opposed any data limits, citing existing regulations such as the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule right of access, while others proposed alternatives to constrain data export\nrequirements, citing development infeasibility.\n\nRecommendations to constrain the proposed criterion’s scope included alignment with\nother regulations and data standards, such as the USCDI. We also received a recommended\nrequirement for health IT developers to provide a plain language definition of the EHI typically\nincluded in their Health IT Module’s export. Some commenters expressed confusion on how the\ncriterion’s proposed scope of data export may apply to EHI “produced or electronically\nmanaged” by both the product’s certified and “non-certified” capabilities as well as data from\nthird parties.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for feedback on our proposed terms and for specific\nrecommendations. The finalized criterion draws the upper bound of its data scope from the\nfocused definition of EHI as finalized. The criterion export includes the EHI, as defined, that can\nbe stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part. As\ndefined in this rule, EHI means electronic protected health information as defined in 45 CFR\n160.103 to the extent that it would be included in a designated record set as defined in 45 CFR\n164.501 (other than psychotherapy notes as defined in 45 CFR 164.501 or information compiled\nin reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative action or\nproceeding), regardless of whether the actor is a covered entity as defined in 45 CFR 160.103. In\nresponse to comments received, this revised scope of data for export provides a more\nmanageable and less administratively burdensome certification criterion for health IT developers\nfor several reasons.\n\nWe agree with commenters that our proposed terms of all EHI a health IT system\n“produces and electronically manages” (84 FR 7448) raised the potential for broad variance in\ninterpretations and concerns about the breadth of data intended for export under this criterion and\npotential development burden. We also considered the comments noting that a developer\npresenting a Health IT Module for certification may not, at the time of certification, know all\nsystems a user will later connect to the health IT capabilities. Ultimately, we considered several\napproaches to better reflect the policy intent and to alleviate confusion related to the proposed\ncriterion. In consideration of the public comments and the policy outcome we sought to address,\nwe revised the final criterion‘s phrasing to describe what information health IT products with\nHealth IT Module(s) certified to the criterion must be capable of exporting. The revised scope of\ndata export applies to both the single patient and patient population export functionalities as well\nas the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements tied to this criterion.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we agree with comments received and acknowledge that a health IT developer is\nbest positioned to know (and would be solely responsible for only) the EHI that can be stored by\nthe health IT product at the time the Health IT Module is presented for certification. In response\nto comments regarding the applicability of the scope of export to the product’s certified and\n“non-certified” capabilities, as well as data from third parties, we clarify and reiterate the\nfollowing from our prior responses. We emphasize that such “stored” data applies to all EHI and\nis agnostic as to whether the EHI is stored in or by the certified Health IT Module or in or by any\nof the other “non-certified” capabilities of the health IT product of which the certified Health IT\nModule is a part. To be clear, conformance “at the time of certification” means the combined\ndata that can be stored by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part, at the time the\nHealth IT Module is presented for certification. As such, for the purposes of this certification\ncriterion, the EHI that must be exported does not include any data generated from unique post-\ncertification in response to a particular customer (though such data could meet the definition of\nEHI for the purposes of information blocking). Such modifications could include custom\ninterfaces and other data storage systems that may be subsequently and uniquely connected to a\ncertified Health IT Module post-certification. Additionally, to remain consistent with “at the time\nof certification,” we clarify that any new EHI stored by the product due to ongoing\nenhancements would need to be included within the scope of certification only when a new\nversion of the product with those new EHI storage capabilities is presented for certification and\nlisting on the CHPL. In consideration of comments, we believe that this approach to define\nstorage at the time the product is presented for certification of a Health IT Module will make the\ncertification requirements more clear for health IT developers and more efficient to administer\nfrom a Program oversight perspective.\n\nIn addition, the use of “can be stored by” refers to the EHI types stored in and by the\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT product, of which the Health IT Module is a part. This is meant to be interpreted as the\ncombination of EHI a heath IT product stores itself and in other data storage locations. Thus, the\ncumulative data covered by these storage techniques would be in the scope of data export.\n\nPer our policy intent, by focusing the definition of EHI and defining the data for export\nunder this criterion, users of certified Health IT, such as health care providers, will have the\nability to create “readily producible” exports of the information of a single patient upon request\nby the user, which increases patient access as reflected in the Cures Act. Lastly, in support of the\nsecond functionality we finalized for patient population export, the EHI exported (within the\nHealth IT product’s scope of data export) would likely be of significant importance to health care\nproviders for the purposes of transitioning health IT systems and maintaining continuity of care\nfor patients, and also helps remove potential barriers to users switching systems to meet their\nneeds or their patient’s needs.\n\nIn finalizing this policy, we emphasize that health IT developers may provide the export of data\nbeyond the scope of EHI and for functionalities beyond those discussed under this criterion. In\nsuch cases, for additional export purposes, it is advised that health IT developers and users\ndiscuss and agree to appropriate requirements and functionalities. We again emphasize that\nhealth IT product users must ensure that any disclosures of data conform to all applicable laws,\nincluding the HIPAA Rules and 42 CFR part 2. Stakeholders should review applicable laws and\nregulations, including those regarding patients’ right of access to their data, in order to determine\nthe appropriate means of disclosing patient data. We also refer readers to the information\nblocking section at VIII.\n\n\n",

We solicited additional feedback\nand comments on the feasibility, practicality, and necessity of exporting images and/or imaging\ninformation. We requested comment on what image elements, at a minimum, should be shared\nsuch as image quality, type, and narrative text. We did not make any proposals in 84 FR 7448.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters were supportive of sharing images and/or related data\nelements, expressing that interoperability should include electronic ordering of imaging studies,\nwhich they asserted would assist health care providers in delivering care. Other commenters\nexpressed burden concerns with data image export, particularly challenges around the movement\nand storage of large amounts of data and accumulating data from disparate health IT systems. A\nfew commenters requested specific exclusion of images or videos created as a byproduct of\nprocedures. As for minimum image data elements to share, recommendations varied and\nincluded Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM™) data elements or file\ntype recommendations. Comments included additional policy recommendations, such as making\nPicture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) developers subject to certification rules\nand requiring EHI export data to include links for remote authorized access to externally hosted\nimages.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their shared insight and recommendations regarding\nthe export of images, imaging information, and image elements. Health IT Modules certified to\nthe finalized criterion must electronically export all of the EHI, as defined, that can be stored at\nthe time of certification by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a part. Thus, any\nimages, imaging information, and image elements that fall within this finalized scope of EHI that\ncan be stored at the time of certification in or by the product, of which the Health IT Module is a\npart will need to be exported under this certification criterion. We appreciate the\nrecommendations received for image transfer methods and encourage the stakeholder community\n\n\n\n\nto continue exploring innovative image transfer methods, including for image transfer that would\nfall outside of this certification criterion. We appreciate the policy recommendations, such as\nincluding PACS developers. The “EHI export” certification criterion only applies to developers\nof health IT seeking or maintaining certification under the Program.

We encourage developers to work with their\ncustomers to achieve innovative ways to share all relevant data, including situations outside of\nthe scope of data export under this criterion where images could be made more accessible.\n\n\n",

This was to prevent loss of information or its meaning to the extent reasonably practicable\nwhen using the developer’s certified Health IT Module(s). We also proposed in §\n170.315(b)(10)(iii) that the developer’s export format must be made available via a publicly\naccessible hyperlink and kept up-to date.\n\n*Comments.* Comments received were in favor of this proposal in § 170.315(b)(10)(iii).\n\n\n\n\nSeveral commenters were supportive of the flexibility of export format for developers, as long as\nexport documentation is provided as specified in the Proposed Rule, citing specifically how this\nwould support the export capability in § 170.315(b)(10)(ii). Some commenters recommended\nadditional clarification for the publicly accessible hyperlink, specifically to ensure that\ninformation is available without login or other associated requirements. Commenters also\nprovided export format suggestions.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback regarding developers’ export format.\n\nWe have finalized § 170.315(b)(10)(iii) with modifications to clarify the regulatory text. We\nfinalized that the export format(s) used to support § 170.315(b)(10)(i) and § 170.315(b)(10)(ii) of\nthis section must be kept up-to-date.\n\nWe clarify that the documentation for the export format(s) in § 170.315(b)(10)(iii)\nconsists of information on the structure and syntax for how the EHI will be exported by the\nproduct such as, for example, C-CDA document(s) or data dictionary for comma separated\nvalues (csv) file(s), and not the actual EHI. The user will use the export format documentation to\nprocess the EHI after it is exported by the product. We also require that health IT developers\nkeep the export format(s) used to support § 170.315(b)(10)(i) and § 170.315(b)(10)(ii) must be\n“up-to-date.” For example, if the health IT developer had previously specified the C-CDA\nstandard as the export format for meeting the criterion, but subsequently updated their product to\nuse the FHIR standard and stopped supporting C-CDA export format then the documentation for\nexport format would need to be updated so that users are able to continue to accurately process\nthe EHI exported by the product. We appreciate suggestions received regarding ensuring that\nsuch information is available without login or other associated requirements. In response to these\ncomments, our policy intent to foster transparency, and in alignment with other certification\ncriterion requirements set forth in this rule, we note our modifications in § 170.315(b)(10)(i)(E)\n\n\n\n\nand § 170.315(b)(10)(ii)(B) that the publicly accessible hyperlink of the export’s format must be\nincluded with the exported file(s). We clarify that the hyperlink must allow any person to directly\naccess the information without any preconditions or additional steps. We note that the export\nformat need not be the same format used internally by the certified health IT and the health IT\ndeveloper does not need to make public their proprietary data model. This certification criterion\nalso does not prescribe how (i.e., media/medium) the exported information is to be made\navailable to the user, as this may depend on the size and type of information to be exported.\n\nWhile file formats and related definitions are not finalized as specific certification requirements,\nwe encourage developers to continue to foster transparency and best practices for data sharing,\nsuch as machine-readable format, when they create and update their export format information.\n\n\n",

We did not propose a transition period for the\n“data export” criterion. Rather, we proposed to remove the criterion from the 2015 Edition Base\nEHR definition upon the effective date of a final rule. We also proposed to modify the 2015\nEdition Base EHR definition to include the new proposed export criterion (defined in §\n\n\n\n\n170.315(b)(10)), with an implementation date 24 months from the effective date of the final rule.\n\nWe welcomed comments on this approach.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters were in favor of immediate removal of this criterion (§\n170.315(b)(6)) from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, stating it would reduce burden.\n\nHowever, the majority of commenters were against a potential gap in functionality due to the\ncompliance timeline for the new export criterion (§ 170.315(b)(10)) and requested that we keep\nthe “data export” criterion until the new criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) and other standardized data\ntransmission methods were fully implemented. Some commenters supported an indefinite\nretention of the “data export” criterion, regardless of the proposed addition of § 170.315(b)(10).\n\nSeveral commenters also recommended to expand the current § 170.315(b)(6) criterion through\nUSCDI as an alternative approach to the proposed “EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). In\naddition, some commenters expressed concern that that the “data export” criterion is inconsistent\nwith CMS Quality Payment Program (QPP) requirements such as View, Download, and\nTransmit (VDT) at 83 FR 59814 of the CY 2019 Physician Fee Schedule final rule.\n\n*Response.* In consideration of public comments in support of the retention of the “data\nexport” certification criterion, we have maintained the “data export” certification criterion in §\n170.315(b)(6) as available for certification until 36 months after this final rule’s publication date.\n\nTo implement this decision, we have finalized in § 170.550(m) that ONC-ACBs are permitted to\nissue certificates to “data export” in § 170.315(b)(6) until, but not after, 36 months after the\npublication date of this final rule. However, we note the “data export” certification criterion has\nbeen removed from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition (in § 170.102) as of the general\neffective date of this final rule (60 days after its publication in the Federal Register). During the\n36 months immediately following publication of this final rule, developers will be able to\nmaintain the certification to § 170.315(b)(6) as a standardized means of exporting the discrete\n\n\n\n\ndata specified in the CCDS, but the criterion will not be updated to the USCDI. Given that\ncertification to the § 170.315(b)(6) criterion will no longer be available after 36 months, we do\nnot believe an update to the USCDI is the best path. Rather, § 170.315(b)(6) will remain an\nunchanged criterion in the Program for the 36 months immediately following publication of this\nfinal rule in the Federal Register. After that timeframe, the EHI export criterion in §\n170.315(b)(10), including that certification criterion’s scope of data export, will remain an\navailable data export certification criterion for health IT developers that present for certification\na Health IT Module that is part of a heath IT product which electronically stores EHI. This\napproach will support prior investments in § 170.315(b)(6) by developers and their customers,\nand also encourage movement toward the interoperability opportunities afforded by new criteria.\n\nRegarding commenter concerns that the “data export” criterion is inconsistent with CMS\nQPP requirements, such as View, Download and Transmit (VDT), we do not believe that this\ncriterion would be inconsistent with QPP program requirements. In the CY 2019 Physician Fee\nSchedule final rule, CMS removed the VDT measure in § 170.315(e)(1) (83 FR 59814).\n\nHowever, the Promoting Interoperability performance category of QPP currently includes the\nmeasure entitled Provide Patients Electronic Access to their Health Information (83 FR 59812\nthrough 59813), and CMS has identified technology certified to the “View, Download and\nTransmit to 3rd\nparty” criterion at 45 CFR 170.315(e)(1) as required to meet this measure (83 FR\n59817). The Data Export criterion in § 170.315(b)(6) is not required for the Provide Patients\nElectronic Access to their Health Information measure included in the Promoting Interoperability\nperformance category, nor have we proposed to change the “View, Download and Transmit to\n3rd\nparty” criterion in § 170.315(e)(1) required for this measure, thus we do not believe this final\npolicy will conflict with CMS requirements for QPP.\n\n\n",

If a developer attests that its Health IT Module encrypts authentication credentials,\nwe proposed in 84 FR 7450 that the attestation would mean that the Health IT Module is capable\nof protecting stored authentication credentials in accordance with standards adopted in §\n170.210(a)(2), Annex A: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 140-2,\n“Approved Security Functions for FIPS PUB 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic\nModules.” We posited that FIPS Publication 140-2 is the seminal, comprehensive, and most\n\n\n\n\nappropriate standard. Moreover, in the specified FIPS 140-2 standard, there is an allowance for\nvarious approved encryption methods, and health IT developers would have the flexibility to\nimplement any of the approved encryption methods in order to attest “yes” to this criterion.

We stated\nthat this could be similar to the approach we utilized for the 2015 Edition “end-user device\nencryption” criterion (§ 170.315(d)(7)(ii)), where we permit the criterion to be met if the health\nIT developer indicates that their health IT is designed to prevent electronic health information\nfrom being locally stored on end-user devices.\n\n\n",

MFA requires users to authenticate using multiple means to\nconfirm they are who they claim to be in order to prove one’s identity, under the assumption that\nit is unlikely that an unauthorized individual or entity will be able to succeed when more than\none token is required. MFA includes using two or more of the following: (i) something people\nknow, such as a password or a personal identification number (PIN); (ii) something people have,\nsuch as a phone, badge, card, RSA token or access key; and (iii) something people are, such as\nfingerprints, retina scan, heartbeat, and other biometric information. Thus, we proposed in 84 FR\n7451 that in order to be issued a certification, a health IT developer must attest to whether or not\nits Health IT Module presented for certification supports MFA consistent with industry-\nrecognized standards (e.g., NIST Special Publication 800-63B Digital Authentication Guidelines,\nISO 2700152\n).\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7451 that, for health IT certified prior to the final rule’s effective\ndate, the health IT would need to be certified to the “multi-factor authentication” certification\ncriterion within six months after the final rule’s effective date. For health IT certified for the first\ntime after the final rule’s effective date, we proposed that the health IT must meet this criterion at\nthe time of certification. We solicited comment on the method of attestation and, if the health IT\n52\nNIST Special Publication 800-63B: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b/cover.html\n\n\n\n\ndeveloper does attest to supporting MFA, whether we should require the health IT developer to\nexplain how they support MFA. In particular, we asked whether a health IT developer should be\nrequired to identify the MFA technique(s) used/supported by submitting specific information on\nhow it is implemented, including identifying the purpose(s)/use(s) to which MFA is applied\nwithin their Health IT Module, and, as applicable, whether the MFA solution complies with\nindustry standards.\n\n*Comments.* The vast majority of commenters supported the adoption of the two proposed\nprivacy and security transparency attestation certification criteria. A few commenters were\nopposed to the new criteria. Several supporters of the proposed criteria recommended that we\nmake the criteria operative functional requirements (including testing), rather than yes/no\nattestations. Some of these commenters reasoned that MFA should be a requirement for all\ncertified health IT, given the risks involved with single-factor authentication and how easy it is\ntoday to implement MFA. We also received a number of comments requesting that we clarify\nthat the MFA proposal does not create a requirement for health care providers to implement\nMFA or encryption of authentication credentials. Similarly, we received several comments\nseeking clarification that a “yes” attestation would only require support of MFA, not that MFA\nwould have to be implemented. Along these same lines, several commenters expressed concerns\nthat the requirements could interfere with clinical care and urged that the requirements not\ncontribute to provider burden.\n\n*Response.* We have adopted both proposed privacy and security transparency attestation\ncriteria and included both criteria (§ 170.315(d)(12) and § 170.315(d)(13)) in the P&S\ncertification framework (§ 170.550(h)), with minor modifications. While some commenters\nrecommended that MFA should be a requirement for all certified health IT, we did not propose\nsuch a requirement nor could health IT developers have foreseen such an outcome in this final\n\n\n\n\nrule based on our proposals, particularly considering the clarity provided with our proposals (84\nFR 7450) and the complexities of such a requirement. For example, as noted by commenters\nbelow, MFA may not be appropriate or applicable in all situations and there is wide variation in\nauthentication needs and approaches throughout the industry. These criteria will, however, still\nprovide increased transparency, and if a developer attests “yes” to these criteria regarding a\ncertified Health IT Module, that Health IT Module will then be subject to ONC-ACB\nsurveillance for any potential non-conformity with the requirements of these criteria. Given the\nstrong support expressed in public comments for these criteria as proposed, we believe this is the\nappropriate approach at this time.\n\nWhile we believe that encrypting authentication credentials and MFA represent best\npractices for privacy and security in health care settings, we emphasize again that these criteria\ndo not require certified health IT to have these capabilities or for health IT developers to\nimplement these capabilities for a specific use case or any use case. Equally important, the\ncriteria place no requirements on health IT users, such as health care providers, to implement\nthese capabilities (if present in their Health IT Modules) in their health care settings. However,\nwe note that information regarding the security capabilities of certified health IT provided by\nsuch transparency can aid health IT users in making informed decisions on how best to protect\nhealth information and comply with applicable security regulations (e.g., the HIPAA Security\nRule).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters who supported the proposed criteria requested clarification\non the scope and intent of the criteria, including what level of authentication and which types of\nusers and user roles the criteria apply to, as well as on how to attest for multiple sign-on paths. A\nnumber of commenters noted the wide variation in authentication needs and approaches\nthroughout the industry, and they recommended that we permit health IT developers to describe\n\n\n\n\nhow they support authentication, rather than simply attest “yes” or “no.” The commenters stated\nthat such information would provide helpful clarity regarding what the certified health IT\nsupports. Additionally, several commenters stated that we should require that health IT\ndevelopers explain how they support MFA. A number of commenters stressed that MFA may not\nbe appropriate or applicable in all situations, and in particular, several commenters noted that\nautomated transactions, including some that may occur in the public health reporting context,\ncannot support MFA.\n\n*Response.* In response to requests for modifications and clarifications, we have modified\nthe “encrypt authentication credentials” criterion to permit a health IT developer that attests “no”\nfor its Health IT Module(s) to indicate why the Health IT Module(s) does not support encrypting\nstored authentication credentials. A health IT developer that attests “no” to the “encrypt\nauthentication credentials” criterion may explain, for example, that its Health IT Module is not\ndesigned to store authentication credentials, therefore there is no need for the Health IT Module\nto encrypt authentication credentials because it does not store, or have the capability to store,\nauthentication credentials.\n\nFor the “MFA” criterion, consistent with our solicitation of comments and the comments\nreceived recommending that health IT developers explain how they support MFA, we have\nmodified the criterion to require health IT developers that attest “yes” to describe the use cases\nsupported. For example, a health IT developer could attest “yes” to supporting MFA and state\nthat the Health IT Module supports MFA for remote access by clinical users, thus providing\nclarity on the user roles to which MFA applies for that particular Health IT Module. To be clear,\nhealth IT developers are not expected to provide specific technical details about how they\nsupport MFA that could pose security risks. Again, the purpose is to enable health IT developers\nto give an indication of the types of uses for which their Health IT Module(s) support MFA. We\n\n\n\n\nnote that health IT developers may wish to add new MFA use cases for their certified health IT\nover a period of time. In such instances, to provide the clarity sought in the Proposed Rule as to\nthe MFA technique(s) used/supported and how MFA is implemented, including identifying the\npurpose(s)/use(s) to which MFA is applied within their Health IT Modules, any new MFA use\ncases are required to comply with this criterion’s “yes” attestation provisions and be part of the\nquarterly CHPL reporting by health IT developers and ONC-ACBs under § 170.523(m).\n\nIf a health IT developer attests “no,” then it would not be required to explain why its\nHealth IT Module does not support authentication, through multiple elements, of the user’s\nidentity with the use of industry-recognized standards. We did not propose to require an\nexplanation for “no” attestation nor did we request comment on allowing health IT developers to\nprovide an explanation for a “no” attestation like we did for “yes” attestations (84 FR 7450-\n7451). However, in an effort to provide transparency and consistency for these privacy and\nsecurity attestation criteria, we will also permit developers to provide a reason for attesting “no”\nin order to provide more context. Such a reason may be due to MFA being inapplicable or\ninappropriate. In those cases, a developer could state, for example, that the Health IT Module\ndoes not support MFA because it is engaged in system-to-system public health reporting and\nMFA is not applicable.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments requesting adjustment to the deadline for\ncompliance to meet these criteria. We also received a number of comments recommending that\nwe only apply both of the proposed criteria to new certifications and new Health IT Modules,\nand not to Health IT Modules already in widespread use.\n\n*Response.* Regarding the timeframe for compliance, and in response to comments\nrecommending that we only apply the criteria to “new certifications,” we have determined that\ncertification to these criteria as part of the updated 2015 Edition privacy and security certification\n\n\n\n\nframework (§ 170.550(h)) will only be necessary for Health IT Modules that are presented for\ncertification. Thus, a new Health IT Module seeking certification for the first time to the criteria\nspecified in the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework (§ 170.550(h)), after\nthe effective date of this final rule, will need to meet these privacy and security transparency\nattestation criteria at the time of certification. Similarly, a previously certified Health IT Module\nthat has undergone revision, such as removal of certain capabilities, and is presenting for revised\ncertification to the criteria specified in the 2015 Edition privacy and security certification\nframework (§ 170.550(h)) after the effective date of this final rule, will need to meet these\nprivacy and security transparency attestation criteria at the time of certification. We believe that\nthis approach will still provide the intended transparency as health IT will need to be issued new\ncertifications as Health IT Modules are updated or certified to other new or revised criteria\nadopted in this final rule. At the same time, this approach should reduce burden for health IT\ndevelopers and allow them more time to plan and prepare to meet these new transparency\nrequirements.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "In the 2015 Edition final rule, we adopted two “data segmentation for privacy” (DS4P)\ncertification criteria. One criterion, “DS4P-send” (§ 170.315(b)(7)), includes capabilities for\napplying security tags according to the DS4P standard in § 170.205(o) at the document-level of a\nsummary care record formatted to the C-CDA 2.1 standard in § 170.205(a)(4). The other\ncriterion, “DS4P-receive” (§ 170.315(b)(8)), includes capabilities for receiving a summary care\nrecord formatted to the C-CDA 2.1 standard in § 170.205(a)(4) with document-level security\ntags according to the DS4P standard in § 170.205(o). As noted in the 2015 Edition final rule (80\nFR 62646), certification to these criteria is not required to meet the CEHRT definition for PI\nPrograms.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity tagging enables computer systems to recognize the existence of sensitive\nelements in data and properly protect the privacy and security of the data by ensuring that only\nthe appropriate individuals and entities can access it. Security tagging capabilities do not\ncompromise the availability or comprehensiveness of health information available for treatment\nor research purposes; rather, they enable appropriate access controls in accordance with existing\npolicies, governance, and applicable laws. The DS4P standard describes a method for applying\nsecurity tags to HL7 CDA documents to ensure that privacy policies established at a record’s\nsource can be understood and enforced by the recipient of the record.\n\nThe utility of the DS4P standard is not limited to data subject to the Federal regulations\ngoverning the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records, 42 CFR part 2 (80 FR\n62647). DS4P may be implemented to support other data exchange use cases in which\ncompliance with State or Federal legal frameworks require special protections for sensitive\nhealth information. Security tagging capabilities are an initial step towards enabling an\ninteroperable health care system to use technical standards to permit appropriate access, use, or\ndisclosure of sensitive health information in accordance with applicable policies and patient\npreferences. We understand and acknowledge additional challenges related the prevalence of\nunstructured data, sensitive images, and potential issues around use of sensitive health\ninformation by clinical decision support systems. The adoption of document level data tagging\nfor structured documents would not solve these issues, but could help move technology in the\ndirection where these issues could be addressed (80 FR 16841).\n\nAdoption of the 2015 Edition final rule DS4P criteria was consistent with earlier HIT\nPolicy Committee (HITPC) recommendations for the use of security tagging to enable the\nelectronic implementation and management of disclosure policies that originate from the patient,\nthe law, or an organization, in an interoperable manner, so that electronic sensitive health\n\n\n\n\ninformation may be appropriately shared.53\nThe HITPC recommendations consisted of a glide\npath for the exchange of 42 CFR part 2-protected data starting with the inclusion of Level 1\n(document level tagging) send and receive functionality. The HITPC also recommended\nadvancing the exchange of 42 CFR part 2-protected data, by outlining additional capabilities in\nsharing, viewing and incorporating privacy restricted data at a more granular level, as well as\nmanaging computable patient consent for the use of restricted data.54\nSince the 2015 Edition final rule, the health care industry has engaged in additional field\ntesting and implementation of the DS4P standard. As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of the\n2019 calendar year, 34 Health IT Modules were certified to one or both of the current 2015\nEdition DS4P certification criteria (Health IT Modules with multiple certified versions were\ncounted once). Stakeholders have shared with ONC – through public forums, listening sessions,\nand correspondence – that document-level security tagging does not provide enough flexibility to\naddress more complex privacy and security use cases. Stakeholders noted that certain provider\ntypes, such as pediatrics and behavioral health, often rely on burdensome manual workflows to\nappropriately segment and share sensitive health information according to State and local laws.\n\nAdditionally, stakeholders expressed interest in ONC adopting health IT standards that work\nwith DS4P to support electronic consent for the exchange of security tagged data over an API.\n\nTherefore, in consideration of stakeholder feedback and HITPC recommendations to\nadopt DS4P certification criteria on a glide path, we proposed (84 FR 7452) to remove the 2015\nEdition DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) certification criteria.\n\n53\nSee HIT Policy Committee (HITPC) Recommendation Letter to ONC, July2 014,\nhttp://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/PSTT_DS4P_Transmittal%20Letter_2014-07-03.pdf; see also HITPC's\nPrivacy and Security Tiger Team Public Meeting, Transcript, May 12, 2014,\nhttp://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/PSTT_Transcript_Final_2014-05-12.pdf; Public Meeting, Transcript,\nMay 27, 2014, http://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/PSTT_Transcript_Final_2014-05-27.pdf\n54\nFor more details on the two glide paths for part 2-protected data, see\nhttp://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/PSTT_DS4P_Transmittal%20Letter_2014-07-03.pdf\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed that the effective date of removal of these criteria would be the effective date of the\nfinal rule. We proposed to replace the removed DS4P criteria with two new 2015 Edition DS4P\ncertification criteria in § 170.315(b)(12) and § 170.315(b)(13) that would support security\ntagging according to the DS4P standard at the document, section, and entry levels of C-CDA 2.1\nformatted documents. Our primary purpose for proposing to remove and replace the criteria, in\nlieu of proposing to revise them, was to provide clarity to stakeholders about the additional\nfunctionality enabled by health IT certified to the new criteria. We also proposed a new 2015\nEdition certification criteria for sharing patient consent information over an API using the\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Consent2Share\n(C2S) IG a FHIR-based exchange standard, in § 170.315(g)(11). We noted resources released by\nONC and OCR, such as the HHS Security Risk Assessment Tool55\nand the Guide to Privacy and\nSecurity of Electronic Health Information,56\nas well as the Office for Civil Rights' security risk\nanalysis guidance57\nthat entities may employ to make risk-based decisions regarding their\nimplementation of the proposed DS4P criteria. We also noted the availability of the Electronic\nConsent Management Landscape Assessment, Challenges, and Technology report.58\nThe report\nincludes suggestions for overcoming barriers associated with implementing electronic consent\nmanagement, which may be considered for further research and discussion.\n\nWe note that we received many comments on the proposed DS4P criteria and the\nproposed consent management for the API criterion but the majority of comments conflated the\ntwo proposals and provided a collective response. We tried to separate where possible, but in\n55\nHHSSecurityRiskAssessmentTool:http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/security-risk-assessment\n56\nONC Guide to Privacyand SecurityofElectronic Health Information: http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/\npdf/privacy/privacy-and-security-guide.pdf.\n\n57\nHHS Office for Civil Rights: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/index.html; and\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/guidance-risk-analysis/index.html?language=es.\n\n58\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-security/ecm_finalreport_forrelease62415.pdf\n\n\n\n\nsome instances, we kept them combined in order to preserve the integrity of the comments.\n\n\n",

Previously, two certification criteria, known as 'DS4P-send' and 'DS4P-receive,' were established to manage security tags at the document level for summary care records. These tags help ensure that sensitive health information is accessed only by authorized individuals, in line with privacy laws and patient preferences. However, feedback from healthcare stakeholders indicated that document-level tagging was insufficient for complex privacy scenarios, such as those in pediatrics and behavioral health, where manual processes are still heavily relied upon. Consequently, the ONC proposed to remove these criteria and introduce new ones that support security tagging at more granular levels (document, section, and entry) and facilitate electronic consent for data exchange via APIs.

                  "text": "In place of the removed 2015 Edition DS4P criteria, we proposed (84 FR 7452) to adopt\nnew DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(13)) criteria that would\nremain based on the CDA 2.1 and the HL7 DS4P standard. These criteria would include\ncapabilities for applying security tags according to the DS4P standard at the document, section,\nand entry level. We believe this offers more valuable functionality to providers and patients,\nespecially given the complexities of the landscape of privacy laws for multiple care and specialty\nsettings. We stated in the Proposed Rule that we believe health IT certified to these criteria\nwould support multiple practice settings and use cases.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments both in support and against this proposal. In\ncertain instances, commenters were supportive of our aims but felt there were too many barriers\nand challenges near term, including but not limited to the perceived cost involved with\nsuccessful segmentation in practice and indicated we should delay our finalization of the\nproposal. Others felt immediate adoption of our proposal in the final rule was critical for patient\ncare and the secure exchange of sensitive health information. Many commenters in favor of our\nproposal provided examples of use cases which it could support, such as helping to combat the\nopioid crisis by facilitating the secure exchange of sensitive health information across health care\nsettings and including substance use disorder (SUD) information covered by 42 CFR part 2. We\nalso received support of our proposal for the protection of women’s health - the commenter\nexplained that segmenting at the element level would protect individuals who have experienced\nintimate partner violence, sexual assault, and other sensitive experiences. Stakeholders shared\nwith us that focusing certification on segmentation to only the document level does not permit\nproviders the flexibility to address more granular segmentation needs. We received many\n\n\n\n\ncomments on this proposal in the context of the following topics: provider and developer burden;\nreadiness of the standard and C-CDA exchange; information blocking and EHI; future\nmultidisciplinary activities (such as workgroups) and creating a vision for segmentation using\nhealth IT; safety; privacy policy conformity; suggested use cases; cost; and requests for specific\nclarifications. We describe these comments further below.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. To address the comments concerned\nabout the cost and timing, at the current time, these criteria are voluntary and not required under\nthe definition of CEHRT or to participate in any HHS program. For more information on the\ncosts for the adoption of these criteria, please see the Regulatory Impact Analysis in section XIII.\n\nFor the reasons noted above, in this final rule, we have finalized our proposal to support a more\ngranular approach to privacy tagging data consent management for health information exchange\nsupported by the C-CDA exchange standard. We do this not by removing and replacing the 2015\nEdition DS4P criteria with new § 170.315(b)(12) and § 170.315(b)(13), but by revising the 2015\nEdition DS4P criteria, DS4P criteria DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive\n(§ 170.315(b)(8)), to include the full scope of the HL7 DS4P standard for security tagging at the\ndocument, section and entry level with modifications as described below.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments regarding the perceived burden of segmentation\non providers and developers including comments focused on workflow challenges. One\ncommenter indicated a lack of system and explained that tagging is burdensome for\nimplementers because it does not describe how to determine what information is sensitive and\nshould be tagged. Another indicated that DS4P creates a permanent added burden of extensive\nand costly manual data curation to redact each page to meet overlapping Federal and State\nregulations. Commenters indicated end users would be required to flag each individual data\nelement, a process that is time consuming and error prone. They further explained that granular\n\n\n\n\nlevel privacy tagging has the risk of adding additional data entry burden to provider workflows if\nusers must tag each item individually.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the thoughtful comments submitted on the proposed criteria.\n\nNotably, with respect to the comments we received that expressed concern about the DS4P\nstandard due to the burden, our analysis of the comments indicates that the concerns the\ncommenters express are more closely related to the complexity of the privacy law landscape than\nto the specific functionality and standard in our proposal. As noted above, at the current time,\nthese criteria are voluntary and not required under the definition of CEHRT or to participate in\nany HHS program. The DS4P standard is a tool and voluntary certification to these criteria is an\ninitial step towards enabling an interoperable health care system to use technical standards to\ncompute and persist security tags to permit access, use, or disclosure of sensitive health\ninformation. The criteria do not specify that a manual workflow is required to implement\nsecurity tagging, and we understand from examples of DS4P use in practice that solutions may\ninclude the use of value sets to automate the tagging process. We reiterate that these criteria are\nintended to apply standards to the transmission of documents so that such security tags may be\ninteroperable. Though the updated criteria would support a more granular approach to tagging\nthe sensitive information, we recognize that this will not solve the whole problem of how to\nmanage data segmentation for privacy and consent management. The recipient will still receive\nand can view the information that is tagged - the recipient will need to determine what they are\ngoing to do with that information. Policies and procedures for what to do with the information\nonce it is received are outside the scope of these criteria and this final rule. However, we\nemphasize that health care providers already have processes and workflows to address their\nexisting compliance obligations for State and Federal privacy laws, which could be made more\nefficient and cost effective through the use of health IT, rather than relying on case-by-case\n\n\n\n\nmanual redaction and subsequent workarounds to transmit redacted documents. We believe this\ntool may be one part of innovative solutions to support health IT enabled privacy segmentation\nin care coordination workflows to significantly reduce the burden of these manual processes\ncurrently in practice.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters indicated that enhanced segmentation may\nunintentionally impact clinical care when providers are presented with an incomplete picture of\npatient data. Commenters stated there could be patient care risks involved with not sharing\nelements as users of downstream systems may not realize that a single element is filtered and act\nimproperly, such as by prescribing a contraindicated medication due to missing information.\n\n*Response.* DS4P is a technical standard for C-CDA that helps health care providers\ncomply with existing, applicable laws. As such, health care providers should already have\nprocesses and workflows in place to address their existing compliance obligations. The DS4P\nstandard does not itself create incomplete records. Under existing law, patients already have the\nright to prevent re-disclosure of certain types of data by withholding consent to its disclosure or\nto place restrictions on its re-disclosure. DS4P allows providers to electronically tag (mark) data\nas sensitive and express re-disclosure restrictions and other obligations in an electronic form.\n\nDS4P does not determine whether a segmentation obligation exists legally or what that legal\nobligation means to the recipient. Instead, DS4P allows for tagging and exchange of health\ninformation that has already been determined to be sensitive and in need of special protections\nunder existing law.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments in support of our proposal indicating that, without\ndata segmentation, other mandatory criteria, such as the proposed “EHI export” criterion, would\nbe difficult to implement without risking disclosure of sensitive data or information blocking.\n\nOne commenter indicated that without this technical standard, it would be difficult for\n\n\n\n\nstakeholders to know whether appropriate consent has been obtained prior to releasing health\ninformation. Further, the commenter indicated concern that without such capabilities, hospitals\nand health systems could be accused of information blocking because they cannot verify that a\npatient has given consent for their EHI to be shared. They further commented that if ONC does\nnot finalize this criterion, then we should provide an appropriate exception in the information\nblocking provisions so that an entity is not accused of information blocking because they do not\nknow if another organization has obtained consent from patients. One commenter stated ONC\nshould propose a new information blocking exception that specifically clarifies that a health IT\ndeveloper’s choice to not certify to an optional standard cannot be a practice that implicates\ninformation blocking.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of the DS4P standard. While we\nunderstand commenters’ concerns, we first reiterate the DS4P capability enables sensitive health\ninformation to be exchanged electronically with security tags in a standardized format. It does\nnot enable the full segmentation of a patient’s record within an EHR, which may be necessary\nwhen responding to a request for EHI. Second, we have revised the Infeasibility Exception in the\ninformation blocking section of this final rule to provide that an actor is not required to fulfill a\nrequest for access, exchange, or use of EHI if the actor cannot unambiguously segment the\nrequested EHI from other EHI: (1) because of a patient’s preference or because the EHI cannot\nbe made available by law; or (2) because the EHI is withheld in accordance with the Harm\nException in § 171.201 (§ 171.204(a)(2)). For instance, an actor will be covered under this\ncondition if the actor could not fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use EHI because the\nrequested EHI could not be unambiguously segmented from patient records created by federally\nassisted programs (i.e., Part 2 Programs) for the treatment of substance use disorder (and covered\nby 42 CFR part 2) or from records that the patient has expressed a preference not to disclose. We\n\n\n\n\nrefer readers to the Infeasibility Exception discussion in section VIII.D.1.d of this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters noted a low level of adoption for these standards and\nconcerns related to readiness expressing that the standard utility is limited by lack of widespread\ndeveloper implementation. Several commenters encouraged ONC to defer adoption of the DS4P\ncriteria with a few commenters recommending that the optional 2015 Edition criterion should be\nmaintained with document level tagging only until practical implementations at scale have been\ndemonstrated at this level. One commenter suggested that organic adoption by end-user\nproviders will help spark innovation in this emerging standard while expressing concern that C-\nCDA level data tagging for privacy is largely untested in real world scenarios. Others\nencouraged ONC to provide additional guidance on the adoption of the DS4P standards and\ncertification criteria and forgo the inclusion of this requirement until additional real world testing\nis available. They also indicated ONC should first conduct use test cases to demonstrate how this\nfunctionality will be effectively used across a variety of environments.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments on the proposed criteria. In reference to the DS4P\nstandard's maturity, we note that it is considered a “normative” standard from the HL7\nperspective—a status which indicates the content has been enhanced and refined through trial\nuse. While we recognize that to date the standard has not been widely adopted, the SAMHSA\nC2S application uses the standard to segment Part 2 information. Likewise, the U.S. Department\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) and private companies across the country have used the DS4P standard\nto support behavioral health and pediatric care models. In addition, as of the fourth quarter of\n2019, 34 individual Health IT Modules obtained certification to one of or both of the prior 2015\nEdition certification criteria. Our intent for adopting the updates to these criteria is that in the\nabsence of adoption of consensus driven standards there is increased risk that single-use-case,\nproprietary solutions will be developed, which may increase fragmentation, provider burden, and\n\n\n\n\ncost while limiting interoperability. Further, the purpose of adopting these criteria is to\nencourage the use of interoperable standards, in this case to use technical standards to compute\nand persist security tags upon exchange of a summary of care document in an interoperable\nmanner. In addition, the certification criteria using the DS4P standard are voluntary and therefore\nour intent is, as commenters noted, to support organic adoption of technology certified to the\ncriteria by providers seeking to implement health IT solutions to replace burdensome manual\nprivacy workflows.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters called for the need to increase conformity among Federal\nand State privacy provisions to achieve successful implementation of granular tagging. They\nnoted the significant policy component involved with the successful implementation of the DS4P\nstandard in practice, and in certain instances specifically noted support for HIPAA Privacy Rule\nand 42 CFR part 2 harmonization. Several commenters identified specific areas for technical\ndevelopment of IT supporting data segmentation for privacy based on Federal and State privacy\nprovisions. One commenter indicated that ONC could map which clinical codes are associated\nwith certain health conditions that receive special privacy protections in addition to the HIPAA\nRules. Other commenters noted that mapping of privacy policy to technical specifications is not\na sufficient or adequate approach given policy complexities. One commenter indicated a future\napproach should focus on development of criteria that support a data provenance driven method\nof sensitive data management as applicable under privacy laws.\n\n*Response.* As we have stated, the DS4P standard enables sensitive health information to\nbe exchanged electronically with security tags in a standardized format and we encourage health\nIT developers to include DS4P functionality and pursue certification of their health IT to these\ncriteria in order to help support their users' compliance with relevant State and Federal privacy\nlaws that protect sensitive health information. We recognize that the current privacy law\n\n\n\n\nlandscape is complex. In light of the complexities of the privacy law landscape, we believe that\nsupporting a standard that allows for increased granularity in security tagging of sensitive health\ninformation would better allow for the interoperable exchange of this information to support a\nwide range of privacy related use cases.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters offered an approach for next steps to advance the standard.\n\nTo advance adoption and implementation of the standard, several commenters suggested that\nONC work closely with clinicians, privacy subject matter experts and interoperability experts\n(notably the HL7 Privacy and Security workgroups) to develop a clear vision for implementing\nenhanced data segmentation. Many commenters specifically called for ONC to sponsor or lead a\nmultidisciplinary workgroup of stakeholders to develop recommendations for industry adoption\nand implementation. One commenter in support of our proposal suggested such workgroup focus\non including whether additional standards are needed, as well as data visualization of non-\ndisclosed data and its utilization in clinical decision support algorithms. Several commenters\ncited existing work to help support potential new multidisciplinary efforts indicating that one\nSDO has already undertaken early work toward evolving DS4P implementation guidance via the\nHL7 V2 to FHIR mapping project sponsored by the HL7 Orders Work Group. One commenter,\ncalled for an ONC led public-private collaborative effort to reduce data entry burden. One\ncommenter recommended that ONC stand up a multi-stakeholder workgroup to identify and\ndefine policy needs and functional requirements to address patient privacy and provider needs.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their recommendations. ONC believes that data\nsegmentation is an integral capability for exchanging sensitive health data. ONC first studied\npolicy considerations regarding data segmentation in electronic health information exchange in\n2010 and informed ONC’s launch of the DS4P Standards and Interoperability Framework (S&I\n\n\n\n\nFramework) Initiative in 2011.59\nThe initiative focused on the development of a DS4P technical\nspecification that would allow highly sensitive health information to flow more freely to\nauthorized users while improving the ability of users of health IT to meet their obligations under\nState and Federal privacy rules. Recommendations from the initiative called for the use of\nmetadata security tags to demonstrate privacy and security obligations associated with patient\nhealth information. It also advised that patients and providers be able to share portions, or\nsegments, of records in order to maintain patient privacy. Pilot projects conducted under the\nDS4P S&I Framework Initiative demonstrated ways to enable the sharing of information that is\nprotected by Federal and State laws, including the substance use disorder treatment\nconfidentiality regulations, 42 CFR part 2. ONC’s prior Federal Advisory Committee, the\nHITPC, also focused on the health IT certification needed to enable exchange of behavioral\nhealth data.60\nAdditionally, ONC led a project on patient choice where the exchange of sensitive\ndata was addressed.61\nONC also led a project on the Behavioral Health Data Exchange (BHDE)\nConsortium. The purpose of the project was to facilitate and address barriers to the intra and\ninterstate exchange of behavioral health data.62\nCurrently, ONC’s Leading Edge Acceleration\nProjects (LEAP) in Health Information Technology (IT) program seeks to address well-\ndocumented and fast emerging challenges inhibiting the development, use, and/or advancement\nof well-designed, interoperable health IT. In 2019, one of the two LEAP awards issued by ONC\nfocused on the standardization and implementation of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability\nResources (FHIR®) Consent resource. Under this project, a FHIR® Consent Implementation\n59\nhttps://archive.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/ds4p-initiative\n60\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/Federal-advisory-committees/health-it-policy-committee-recommendations-\nnational-coordinator\n61\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/patient-consent-electronic-health-information-exchange\n62\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/health-it-health-care-settings/behavioral-health-data-exchange-primary-care-and-\nbehavioral\n\n\n\n\nGuide (IG) and package of open-source prototypes and content to assist partners in using the\nFHIR® Consent Resource will become available.63\nAlso, ONC actively participates in HL7 International (HL7®) Workgroups and\nstandards-development activities related to data segmentation and consent management. It is\ncritical for sensitive health information to be included in health information exchange and we are\nexploring opportunities for additional collaboration in the future.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended a companion guide be developed to assist\nimplementers with the standard. Another indicated ONC should provide guidance to facilitate\nadoption of the DS4P standards and certification criteria including dissemination of best\npractices to help ensure that providers can most effectively implement the standards and\nassociated workflows. Another referred to a Query-Based Document Exchange IG which has\nfurther guidance on the ability to assert access policies and DS4P implementation considerations.\n\n*Response.* The HL7 Version 3 Implementation Guide: Data Segmentation for Privacy\n(DS4P), Release 1, Part 1: CDA R2 and Privacy Metadata Reusable Content Profile, May 16,\n2014 standard64\n§ 170.205(o)(1) (HL7 DS4P standard) describes the technical means to apply\nsecurity tags to a health record and data may be tagged at the document-level, the section-level,\nor individual data element-level. The HL7 DS4P standard also provides a means to express\nobligations and disclosure restrictions that may exist for the data. We appreciate commenters\ninput on additional guidance beyond these certification requirements that may prove useful for\ndevelopers. However, we reiterate that in this rule we address only that guidance that is required\nfor those developers to voluntarily submit a Health IT Module for certification to our criteria.\n\nAdditional guidance on best practices would be outside the scope of this rulemaking. However,\n63\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/leading-edge-acceleration-projects-leap-health-information-technology-health-it\n64\nhttps://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=354\n\n\n\n\nas noted above, we are committed to continuing to work with stakeholders, including health IT\ndevelopers and those involved in implementing privacy policy in the health care industry, to\nwork toward interoperable solutions for privacy and consent management.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments seeking clarification on our proposal to\nremove the current 2015 Edition “DS4P-send” (§ 170.315(b)(7)) and “DS4P-receive” (§\n170.315(b)(8)) certification criteria and to replace these two criteria with three new 2015 Edition\nDS4P certification criteria (two for C-CDA and one for a FHIR-based API). As examples, one\ncommenter sought clarification on whether our proposal was for DS4P send and receive to\nbecome mandatory for the revised 2015 Edition certification, or if they will remain voluntary\ncriteria. One commenter sought clarification on whether the data protections apply to FHIR\ntransmissions. Another indicated that they believe the DS4P implementation guide only focuses\non data segmentation for C-CDA documents and not for HL7 FHIR and sought ONC\nclarification regarding whether or not we intend to apply data segmentation labeling to the HL7\nFHIR resources in support of the USCDI as well. Another commenter recommended that we\nrequire FHIR Release 4 version but commented that a consistent approach of USCDI across HL7\nCDA, C-CDA and HL7 FHIR is not attainable at this time. One commenter stated a similar need\nfor clarification indicating that the standard for DS4P should be HL7 standards for CDA Version\n2 and FHIR security tagging and not be the SAMHSA C2S stating that ONC should clarify this\nmisunderstanding. Another commenter sought clarification by ONC to indicate that the IG is for\nCCDS and not FHIR, and also indicated confusion regarding STU4. One commenter noted that\nthe DS4P criteria are only effective for C-CDA-based data exchange and recommended ONC\nadd FHIR-based standard for tagging of sensitive data. Several commenters expressed concern\nover what they described as misalignment of this proposal with other ONC policies explaining\nthat neither USCDI nor ARCH, nor HL7 FHIR US Core includes the FHIR Composition\n\n\n\n\nresource, which would be at the equivalent level of granularity as a C-CDA document.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and we appreciate the need for clarity\nrequested by commenters. In the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7452), we proposed both to adopt an\nupdate to the HL7 DS4P standard for the existing 2015 Edition certification criteria to support\nsecurity tagging of a C-CDA upon send and receive by removing DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(7))\nand DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) and replacing them with DS4P-send (§ 170.315(b)(12)) and\nDS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and to also adopt a new criterion to support API exchange via\nconsent management solutions using the FHIR standard. In other words, these were two separate\nproposals, the first to support security tags in summary of care documents and another to support\nconsent management for specific use cases that leverage a FHIR-based API. As of this final rule,\nthese criteria remain voluntary and not required under the definition of CEHRT or to participate\nin any HHS program. We proposed these several criteria in a single section of the Proposed Rule\nbecause of the relationship between them as two potential health IT tools that could be part of\noverarching solutions to manage privacy and consent in health information exchange. However,\nas stated earlier, we note that neither of these tools addresses the entirety of the scope of data\nsegmentation for privacy. To address the comment on the DS4P implementation guide, we\nconfirm that the HL7 DS4P standard in § 170.205(o)(1) describes the technical means to apply\nsecurity tags to a health record and data may be tagged at the document-level, the section-level,\nor individual data element-level in the C-CDA and not for FHIR. Currently, we do not intend to\napply data segmentation labeling to the HL7 FHIR resources in support of the USCDI because\nall FHIR resources already include the capability to apply security tags to the resource as\nmetadata. We appreciate the recommendation to require FHIR Release 4 for consent\nmanagement but as discussed below, we have decided not to finalize the proposal for consent\nmanagement for APIs in this final rule. For further discussion of our FHIR-based consent\n\n\n\n\nmanagement proposal, we direct readers to subsection b below.\n\nFor the updates to the existing DS4P criteria, to support greater clarity requested by\npublic comment, rather than removing the existing 2015 Edition criteria and replacing them with\nnew criteria as proposed, we instead finalized a simple update to the existing criteria to note the\nuse of the full HL7 DS4P standard for tagging or applying security tags at the document, section,\nand entry level.\n\nWe further note that these updated criteria remain voluntary, and that we have finalized\nmodifications in § 170.315(b)(7)(ii) and § 170.315(b)(8)(i)(B) to our proposed effective date for\nthis change to allow for a longer glide path for health IT developers to update Health IT Modules\nto the full standard to better support clinical and administrative workflows. While certification to\nthe updated standards will be available after the effective date of this final rule upon successful\ntesting, we have finalized that document-level tagging remains applicable for up to 24 months\nafter the publication date of this final rule. For certification and compliance of Health IT\nModules certified after 24 months after the publication date of this final rule, only the full scope\nof the HL7 DS4P standard is applicable. We have finalized this 24 month period for the update\nfor these criteria under the real world testing provisions in § 170.405(b)(6) as follows:\n Security tags. A health IT developer with health IT certified to § 170.315 (b)(7) and/or §\n170.315 (b)(8) prior to June 30, 2020, must:\no Update their certified health IT to be compliant with the revised versions of the\ncriteria adopted in § 170.315(b)(7) and/or the revised versions of the criteria\nadopted in § 170.315(b)(8); and\no Provide its customers of the previously certified health IT with certified health IT\nthat meets paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section by May 2, 2022,\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have finalized these updated criteria with modifications to the criteria\nnames to better describe the function the criteria support in interoperable health IT systems. The\nmodifications to the criteria are as follows:\n Prior criterion: “DS4P-send” (§ 170.315(b)(7)) includes capabilities for creating a\nsummary care record formatted to the C-CDA standard and document-level tagging as\nrestricted (and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure) according to the DS4P standard.\n\n Revised criterion: “Security tags – Summary of Care (send)” (§ 170.315(b)(7)) includes\ncapabilities for creating a summary of care record formatted to the C-CDA standard and\nthat is tagged as restricted and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure according to the\nDS4P standard at the document, section, and entry (data element) level, or at the\ndocument-level for the period until May 2, 2022.\n\n Prior criterion: “DS4P-receive” (§ 170.315(b)(8)) includes capabilities for receiving a\nsummary care record formatted to the C-CDA standard and document-level tagged as\nrestricted (and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure) according to the DS4P standard.\n\n Revised criterion: “Security tags – Summary of Care (receive)” (§ 170.315(b)(8))\nincludes capabilities for receiving a summary of care record formatted to the C-CDA\nstandard and that is tagged as restricted and subject to restrictions on re-disclosure\naccording to the DS4P standard at the document, section, and entry (data element) level,\nor at the document-level for the period until May 2, 2022. We have finalized our proposal\nto include in the voluntary “Security tags – Summary of Care (receive)” (§\n170.315(b)(8)) criterion as a requirement that the Health IT Module has the capability to\npreserve privacy markings to ensure fidelity to the tagging based on consent and with\nrespect to sharing and re-disclosure restrictions as proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

              "text": "Standard\nIn collaboration with ONC, SAMHSA developed the C2Sapplication to address the\nspecific privacy protections for patients with substance use disorders whose treatment records are\ncovered by the Federal confidentiality regulation, 42 CFR part 2. C2S is an open source\napplication for data segmentation and consent management. It is designed to integrate with\nexisting FHIR systems. SAMHSA created a FHIR implementation guide (the Consent2Share\nConsent Profile Design, hereafter referred to as “Consent Implementation Guide”) that describes\nhow the Consent2Share application and associated access control solution (C2S platform) uses\nthe FHIR Consent resource to represent and persist patient consent for treatment, research, or\ndisclosure.65\nThe implementation guide provides instructions for using the FHIR Consent\nresource to capture a record of a health care consumer’s privacy preferences.\n\nIn section VII.B.4 of this final rule, we discuss policies related to the implementation of a\nstandardized API to support the exchange of health information between providers and patients\nand among members of a care team. In the Proposed Rule, we anticipated that the proposed 2015\nEdition “standardized API for patient and population services” certification criterion (§\n170.315(g)(10)) would result in a proliferation of APIs that will enable a more flexible and less\nburdensome approach to exchanging EHI. We stated our belief that the health care industry\ncould leverage this API infrastructure to share segmented data in a secure and scalable manner.\n\nTherefore, we proposed to adopt a 2015 Edition certification criterion “consent management for\nAPIs” in § 170.315(g)(11) to support data segmentation and consent management through an\n65\nThe draft FHIR IG titled “Consent2Share FHIR Profile Design.docx” can be accessed through the Community-\nBased Care and Privacy(CBCP) HL7 workgroup, within the Package Name titled “BHITS_FHIR_Consent_IG,” at\nhttps://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/cbcc/frs/.\n\n\n\n\nAPI in accordance with the Consent Implementation Guide.\n\n*Comments.* Overall, the majority of commenters were supportive of the concept of\nconsent management for APIs but many had concerns with the proposed criteria, specifically the\nadoption of the Consent Implementation Guide or the C2S platform as part of a certification\ncriterion. Many commenters raised concerns that the Consent Implementation Guide has not\nbeen balloted as an HL7 standard and noted that C2S does not support a consenter’s signature or\nspecification to protect information content data requirements. A couple of commenters stated\nthat the Consent Implementation Guide is a new emerging standard in pilot with feedback\nrequested. Commenters also raised concern that the IG has not gone through an SDO process.\n\nAnother commenter raised concern that SAMHSA no longer supports the C2S platform and the\nConsent Implementation Guide and it now lacks a steward. A couple of commenters suggested\nONC defer the consent management criteria at least until an API FHIR standard version is\nfinalized and the Consent Implementation Guide is revised to conform that to that version. One\ncommenter supported the adoption of FHIR v3-based Consent resource, but urged ONC to also\nconsider pediatric and geriatric use cases in its adoption. Other commenters stated that their\nunderstanding was that tagging will be a feature of FHIR Release 4, but were unclear how the\nproposal to move to FHIR Release 2 would work. One commenter questioned how if there are no\nstandards-based approaches for identifying what in the record is sensitive, how one could\nfeasibly implement privacy-tagging and consent management via FHIR at the Resource level and\nthat tagging at a more granular level is too cumbersome and unrealistic. A number of\ncommenters stated that the standards were premature and if adopted could have unintended\nnegative effects. Commenters were not supportive of having two versions of FHIR but instead\nrecommended the use of FHIR Release 4. Commenters recommended ONC focus on driving\nreal-world implementation experience before adopting the standards.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a few commenters supported our proposal, and stated that the C2S\nplatform and the Consent Implementation Guide is mature and already supports granular level\nsecurity tagging and data segmentation and supports several API standards listed in the Proposed\nRule. One commenter expressed support broadly for the C2S platform indicating that, though it\nwas originally designed to satisfy 42 CFR part 2 consent for the substance use disorder data, it\nsupports the other sensitive categories such as HIV and mental health. Several commenters stated\nthat the criteria should be required in the Base EHR definition.\n\nMany providers called for patient education and for ONC to work with SAMHSA, OCR,\nand CMS. It was also suggested that ONC coordinate with SAMHSA to establish a public-\nprivate project to advance the C2S platform and the Consent Implementation Guide using an\nanalogous process to that of the Da Vinci Project with transparency and with no membership\nfees. Finally, several commenters raised issues that are out of scope for this rule including\nconcerns specifically with the HIPAA Rules or 42 CFR part 2 which are under the authority of\nOCR and SAMHSA respectively.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments received and the insights into real world\nimplementing challenges of consent management. We agree that there is continued work to be\ndone to ballot and field test the C2S platform and the Consent Implementation Guide and also\nagree with commenters that identified this resource as having significant potential to support\nconsent management for specific use cases such as 42 CFR part 2, behavioral health, and\npediatric care. We also note that we had included a series of questions in our Proposed Rule\nrelated to the alignment of FHIR releases and we appreciate comments received related to these\nquestions. We direct readers to section VII.B.4.c for further discussion of our adoption in this\nrule the FHIR Release 4 standard. We note that the Consent Implementation Guide is designed in\nFHIR Release 3 and that there is significant work to be done in standards development before the\n\n\n\n\nIG would be feasible with FHIR Release 4. At this time, FHIR Release 4 version of FHIR\nconsent resource is not normative and can change from version to version and therefore further\ndevelopment, review, balloting, and testing would be required for a FHIR Release 4 based IG to\nbe a viable consensus standard for adoption in the Program. In consideration of comments, and\nthe scope of the additional work required for readiness of an IG that could be adopted in our\nregulations, we have not finalized the proposed “consent management for APIs” certification\ncriterion in § 170.315(g)(11). We maintain, as stated above, that the C2S platform and the\nConsent Implementation Guide may still serve as a template for implementation of consent\nmanagement workflows leveraging APIs and that it may be a part of health IT solutions to\nfacilitate health information exchange of sensitive information. We will continue to monitor the\ndevelopment of the Consent Implementation Guide and other FHIR resources to support consent\nmanagement and may consider including in a future rulemaking.\n\n\n",

As noted in section IV.B.8.a, we have also\nadopted both proposed privacy and security transparency attestation criteria (§ 170.315(d)(12)\nand (d)(13)) with minor modifications. We have applied § 170.315(d)(12) and (d)(13) to all\ncertification criteria across the P&S Certification Framework. Table 2 shows the final updated\nP&S Certification Framework, which includes all changes including the removal of certain 2015\nEdition certification criteria as finalized in section III.B.4 of this final rule. We updated the P&S\nCertification Framework to reflect other changes made throughout this final rule. The privacy\nand security certification criteria applicable to a Health IT Module presented for certification is\nbased on the other capabilities included in the Health IT Module and for which certification is\nsought (80 FR 62705). In this final rule, we have determined that § 170.315(b)(10) and,\nconsistent with the rationale provided in the 2015 Edition final rule, (g)(1) through (6) are\nexempt from the P&S Certification Framework due to the capabilities included in these criteria,\n\n\n\n\nwhich do not implicate privacy and security concerns (80 FR 62707). We have revised §\n170.550(h) of this final rule to reflect these clarifications. We also corrected Table 2 to\naccurately reflect the regulatory text at § 170.315(a)(3), (a)(14), and (a)(15). Sections\n170.315(a)(3), (a)(14), and (a)(15), though included in the regulatory text, were erroneously\ndeleted in the Proposed 2015 Edition Privacy and Security Certification Framework table and we\ncorrected it in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: 2015 Edition Privacy and Security Certification Framework\nIf the Health IT Module\nincludes capabilities for\ncertification listed under:\nIt will need to be certified to approach 1 or approach 2 for each of the P&S\ncertification criteria listed in the “approach 1” column\nApproach 1 Approach 2\n§ 170.315(a)(1) through (3),\n(5), (12), (14), and (15)\n§ 170.315(d)(1) (authentication, access\ncontrol, and authorization),\n(d)(2) (auditable events and tamper\nresistance),\n(d)(3) (audit reports),\n(d)(4) (amendments),\n(d)(5) (automatic log-off), (d)(6)\n(emergency access), (d)(7) (end-user\ndevice encryption)\n(d)(12) (encrypt authentication\ncredentials)\n(d)(13) (multi-factor authentication)\nFor each applicable P&S\ncertification criterion not\ncertified using Approach 1,\nthe health IT developer\nsubmits system\ndocumentation that is\nsufficiently detailed to enable\nintegration such that the\nHealth IT Module has\nimplemented service\ninterfaces for each applicable\nP&S certification criterion\nthat enable the Health IT\nModule to access external\nservices necessary to meet the\nrequirements of the P&S\ncertification criterion\n§ 170.315(a)(4), (9), (10),\nand (13)\n§ 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3),\n(d)(5) through (d)(7), (d)(12), and\n(d)(13)\n§ 170.315(b)(1) through\n(3) and (6) through (9)\n§ 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3), (d)(5)\nthrough (d)(8) (integrity), (d)(12), and\n(d)(13)\n§ 170.315(c) § 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3) and (d)(5),\n(d)(12), and (d)(13)*\n§ 170.315(e)(1) § 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3), (d)(5),\n(d)(7), (d)(9) (trusted connection),\n(d)(12), and (d)(13)\n§ 170.315(e)(2) and (3) § 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3), (d)(5),\n(d)(9), (d)(12), and (d)(13)*\n§ 170.315(f) § 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3), (d)(7),\n(d)(12), and (d)(13)\n§ 170.315(g)(7) through\n(g)(10)\n§ 170.315(d)(1) and (d)(9); (d)(2) or\n(d)(10) (auditing actions on\nhealth information), (d)(12),\nand (d)(13)\n§ 170.315(h) § 170.315(d)(1) through (d)(3), (d)(12),\n\n\n\n\nand (d)(13)*\nAn ONC-ACB must ensure that a Health IT Module presented for certification to any of the certification criteria that\nfall into each regulatory text “first level paragraph” category of § 170.315 (e.g., § 170.315(a)) identified in Table 2 is\ncertified to either Approach 1 (technically demonstrate) or Approach 2 (systemdocumentation).\n\nIn order to be issued a certification, a Health IT Module would only need to be tested once to each applicable\nprivacy and security criterion identified as part of Approach 1 or Approach 2 so long as the health IT developer\nattests that such privacy and security capabilities apply to the full scope of capabilities included in the requested\ncertification, except for the certification of a Health IT Module to § 170.315(e)(1) “view, download, and transmit\nto 3rd\nparty.” For this criterion, a Health IT Module must be separately tested to § 170.315(d)(9) because of the\nspecific capabilities for secure electronic transmission included in the criterion.\n\n* § 170.315(d)(2)(i)(C) is not required if the scope of the Health IT Module does not include end-user device\nencryption features.\n\n\n",

We also proposed to\nclarify that HHS has the ability to access certification records for the “life of the edition,” which\nbegins with the codification of an edition of certification criteria in the Code of Federal\nRegulations through a minimum of three years from the effective date of the final rule that\nremoves the applicable edition from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), not solely during\nthe threes-year period after removal from the CFR (84 FR 7456).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support for ONC’s proposal to revise the\nrecords retention requirement.

Because the “life of the edition” begins with the codification of an edition of\n\n\n\n\ncertification criteria in the CFR and ends on the effective date of the final rule that removes the\napplicable edition from the CFR, the start and end dates for the “life of the edition” are published\nin the Federal Register in the rulemaking actions that finalize them. The period of three years\nbeyond the “life of the edition” begins on the effective date of the final rule that removes the\napplicable edition from the CFR, thus the three-year period after removal from the CFR\ncontinues through three full calendar years following that date.

              "text": "The PoPC in § 170.523(h) specified that ONC-ACBs may only certify health IT that has\nbeen tested by ONC-ATLs using tools and test procedures approved by the National\nCoordinator. We proposed to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(h) in three ways (84 FR 7456).\n\nFirst, we proposed to revise this PoPC to additionally permit ONC-ACBs to certify\nHealth IT Modules that the ONC-ACB has evaluated for conformance with certification criteria\nwithout first passing through an ONC-ATL. However, we proposed that such methods to\ndetermine conformity must first be approved by the National Coordinator.\n\nSecond, we proposed to revise the PoPC to clarify that certifications can only be issued to\nHealth IT Modules and not Complete EHRs. We proposed to remove the 2014 Edition from the\nCFR (see section III.B.2 of this preamble) and Complete EHR certifications are no longer\navailable for certification to the 2015 Edition (80 FR 62608; 79 FR 54443). We also proposed to\nremove the provision that permits the use of test results from National Voluntary Laboratory\n\n\n\n\nAccreditation Program (NVLAP)-accredited testing laboratories under the Program because the\nregulatory transition period from NVLAP-accredited testing laboratories to ONC-ATLs has\nexpired (81 FR 72447).\n\nThird, we proposed to remove the provision that permits the certification of health IT\npreviously certified to an edition if the certification criterion or criteria to which the Health IT\nModule(s) was previously certified have not been revised and no new certification criteria are\napplicable because the circumstances that this provision seeks to address are no longer feasible\nwith certification to the 2015 Edition.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter sought clarification on whether the proposal to remove\nreferences to § 170.545, which includes the ability to maintain Complete EHR certification,\nwould impact § 170.550(k), which requires ONC-ACBs to accept requests for a newer version of\na previously certified Health IT Module(s) to inherit the certified status of the previously\ncertified Health IT Module(s) without requiring the newer version to be recertified. The\ncommenter strongly urged ONC to allow ONC-ACBs to grant inherited certification status to\nupdated versions of certified technology. Another commenter expressed support for ONC’s\nproposal to revise the PoPC to clarify that certifications can only be issued to Health IT Modules\nand not Complete EHRs. The commenter also expressed support for ONC’s proposal to remove\nthe provision that permits the certification of health IT previously certified to an edition if the\ncertification criterion or criteria to which the Health IT Module(s) was previously certified have\nnot been revised and no new certification criteria are applicable because the circumstances that\nthis provision seeks to address are no longer feasible with certification to the 2015 Edition.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the proposal to revise the PoPC in § 170.523(h). As noted in\nthe Proposed Rule, the ability to maintain Complete EHR certification is only permitted with\nhealth IT certified to the 2014 Edition certification criteria (84 FR 7435). Because this concept\n\n\n\n\nwas not continued in the 2015 Edition (84 FR 7456), we proposed revisions to clarify that\nComplete EHR certifications are no longer available. We note that ONC-ACBs have discretion,\nand processes in place, to evaluate updates made to certified health IT and assess the need for\nadditional testing. These ONC-ACB processes allow for efficient certification of upgraded\nversion releases of previously certified health IT while ensuring its continued conformity with\ncertification criteria and standards to which the prior version release of the same Module(s) had\nbeen certified. We have finalized this proposal.\n\n*Comments.* Multiple commenters expressed support for the use of conformance methods\napproved by the National Coordinator. One commenter noted that the opportunity would enable\nalternative testing methods and less costly testing. Another commenter noted that this proposal\nwould reduce burden for EHR developers and for ONC-ATLs by leveraging certification\nprograms and alternative test methods and specifically requested that ONC consider a specific\nproprietary certification related to e-prescribing functionalities for potential approval. While\nexpressing appreciation for the flexibility offered by the proposed revision, one commenter\nexpressed concern about certifications based on other ONC-approved conformance methods that\nare not specifically designed to test against the ONC criteria and stressed the importance of\nassessing conformance to technical standards before being deployed to end users. Another\ncommenter questioned whether the ONC-ACB would be permitted to do all evaluation directly,\nthus eliminating the need for ONC-ATLs entirely. Two commenters sought clarity from ONC as\nto what metrics the National Coordinator will use to approve a conformance method. These\ncommenters also sought clarification on ONC’s plan to reduce the risk of developers seeking\ncertification through fraudulent means. The commenters cited the example of two developers\nwho are currently operating under corporate integrity agreements with the HHS Office of the\nInspector General due to court cases brought against them in relation to conduct including, but\n\n\n\n\nnot limited to, the process of seeking certification.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We have finalized the proposal to\nrevise the PoPC in § 170.523(h) to permit a certification decision to be based on an evaluation\nconducted by the ONC-ACB for Health IT Modules' compliance with certification criteria by use\nof conformity methods approved by the National Coordinator.\n\nWe note that all certification criteria will continue to have some method of holding\ndevelopers responsible for demonstrating conformity whether through ONC-ATL testing,\ndeveloper self-declaration, or some other method assessed and approved by the National\nCoordinator. As noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7456), ONC acknowledges that there is a\nbroad spectrum of types of evidence of conformance, from laboratory testing with an ONC-ATL\nto developer self-declaration. Some of these types of evidence may be more appropriate than\nothers in specific circumstances. Historically, it has been proven that, in some circumstances, the\nrequirement for ONC-ATL testing has presented more administrative burden on health IT\ndevelopers than benefits for assessing conformity. For example, under § 170.315(a)(5)\ndemographics certification criteria require only documentation or a visual inspection, and do not\nrequire testing by an ONC-ATL. We note that industry advancements have presented\nopportunities for improved efficiency for demonstrating conformity and this flexibility will allow\nthe Program to advance as the state of the art for demonstrating conformance evolves. This\nflexibility addresses the current Program construct limitation of ONC-ACB certification only\nbeing permissible for health IT that has been tested by an ONC-ATL with ONC-approved test\nprocedures. In some instances, such as developer self-declaration, there is no testing required and\nthus bypassing the ONC-ATL testing step reduces burden and enables a more streamlined and\nefficient process. By adopting this flexibility, we may approve conformance methods that rely\nsolely on ONC-ACB evaluation, and not ONC-ATL testing, when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nWe will follow the same process used for alternative test methods (76 FR 1280) for the\nsubmission of non-governmental developed conformance methods to the National Coordinator\nfor approval. A person or entity may submit a conformance method to the National Coordinator\nto be considered for approval for use under the Program. The submission should identify the\ndeveloper of the conformance method; specify the certification criterion or criteria that is/are\naddressed by the conformance method; and explain how the conformance method would\nevaluate a Health IT Module’s or, if applicable, other type of health IT’s, compliance with the\napplicable certification criterion or criteria. The submission should also provide information\ndescribing the process used to develop the conformance method, including any opportunity for\nthe public to comment on the conformance method and the degree to which public comments\nwere considered. In determining whether to approve a conformance method for purposes of the\nProgram, the National Coordinator will consider whether it is clearly traceable to a certification\ncriterion or criteria adopted by the Secretary; whether it is sufficiently comprehensive (i.e.,\nassesses all required capabilities) for the assessment of Health IT Modules’, or other type of\nhealth IT’s, conformance to the certification criterion or criteria adopted by the Secretary;\nwhether an appropriate public comment process was used during the development of the\nconformance method; and any other relevant factors. When the National Coordinator has\napproved a conformance method for purposes of the Program, we will publish a notice of\navailability in the Federal Register and identify the approved conformance method on the ONC\nweb site.\n\n\n",

In the Proposed Rule, we provided a\nhistory of the many actions we have taken since the inception of the ONC Health IT Certification\nProgram through the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7457). As stated in the Proposed Rule, section\n4001(b)(i) of the Cures Act instructs the National Coordinator to encourage, keep, or recognize,\nthrough existing authorities, the voluntary certification of health IT under the Program for use in\nmedical specialties and sites of service for which no such technology is available or where more\ntechnological advancement or integration is needed. This provision of the Cures Act closely\naligns with our ongoing collaborative efforts with both Federal partners and stakeholders within\nthe health care and health IT community to encourage and support the advancement of health IT\nfor a wide range of clinical settings. These initiatives have included projects related to clinical\npriorities beyond those specifically included in the EHR Incentive Programs (now called the\nPromoting Interoperability Programs) including efforts in public health, behavioral health, and\nlong-term and post-acute care. We noted in the Proposed Rule that these initiatives often include\nthe development of non-regulatory informational resources to support the specific\nimplementation goal and align with the technical specifications already available in the Program\nfor certification. To advance these efforts, we also explained in the Proposed Rule that we\ngenerally consider a range of factors including: stakeholder input and identification of clinical\n\n\n\n\nneeds and clinical priorities, the evolution and adoption of health IT across the care continuum,\nthe costs and benefits associated with any policy or implementation strategy related to care\nsettings and sites of service, and potential regulatory burden and compliance timelines. Our goal\nwas then and is now to support the advancement of interoperable health IT and to promote health\nIT functionality in care and practice settings across the care continuum (see 80 FR 62604). As\nstated in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7458), generally, our approach can be summarized in three\nparts:\n First, we analyze existing certification criteria to identify how such criteria may be\napplicable for medical specialties and sites of service.\n\n Second, we focus on the real-time evaluation of existing and emerging standards to\ndetermine applicability to medical specialties and sites of service as well as to the broader\ncare continuum, including the evaluation of such standards for inclusion in the ONC\nInteroperability Standards Advisory (ISA).68\n Third, we may work in collaboration with stakeholders to support the development of\ninformational resources for medical specialties and sites of service for which we identify\na need to advance the effective implementation of certified health IT.\n\nWe continue to believe this approach is economical, flexible, and responsive for both\nhealth care providers and the health IT industry. It is also in alignment with the provisions of\nsection 4001(a) in the Cures Act related to burden reduction and promoting interoperability.

              "text": "Section 4001(b)(iii) of the Cures Act – “Health information technology for pediatrics”\nrequires:\n First, that the Secretary, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, shall make\nrecommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric\nhealth providers to support the health care of children, and\n Second, that the Secretary shall adopt certification criteria to support the voluntary\ncertification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to support the health care\nof children.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7458), we described our approach to stakeholder\nengagement, the analysis used to develop the recommendations, the specific 2015 Edition\ncertification criteria that support each recommendation, and the voluntary certification of health\nIT for use by pediatric health providers to support the health care of children.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments requesting further clarification on whether the\npediatric health IT recommendations will be adopted as an independent certification program\nand/or certification criteria designated specifically for pediatric care. One commenter\nrecommended that pediatric provisions should be formalized over time within what they refer to\nas the current pediatric program and not as a separate program, and that this future aligns with\nthe 2015 Children’s EHR Format. One commenter also sought clarification as whether ONC\nintends for other government agencies/programs such as CHIP, to develop conditions of\nparticipation or financial incentives around the adoption of certification criteria identified in this\nrulemaking. We also received several comments stating that since current EHRs have pediatric\n\n\n\n\ncapabilities, there is no need to specify requirements in regulation, and that there is no value in\nhaving EHRs certified as “pediatric-friendly,” only increased costs. We also received several\ncomments stating that our approach reflects an attempt to retrofit the needs of pediatric patients\nby using adult requirements.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. The comments we received suggests\na need for greater clarity on our approach. We therefore reiterate that we did not propose to adopt\ncare- or practice-specific certification tracks, or additional voluntary program(s), in parallel to\nthe existing voluntary ONC Health IT Certification Program. In the Proposed Rule, we reiterated\nour statements from the 2015 Edition final rule, which explained that we did not intend to\ndevelop and issue separate regulatory certification “paths” or “tracks” for particular care or\npractice settings (e.g., a “long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) certification”) because it would\nbe difficult to independently construct such “paths” or “tracks” in a manner that would align with\nother relevant programs and specific stakeholder needs. We further stated that stakeholders had\nindicated that separate certification pathways could have unintended consequences related to\nincreasing burden on health care providers and health IT developers. We also stated that we\nwould welcome the opportunity to work with HHS agencies, other agencies, and provider\nassociations in identifying the appropriate functionality and certification criteria in the Program\nto support their stakeholders (80 FR 62704). In response to the comments regarding our\napproach to implement section 4001(b) of the Cures Act, we clarify that the 2015 Edition\ncertification criteria identified for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric\nhealth providers are agnostic to the age of the patient (with the exception of the pediatric vital\nsigns in the USCDI). Therefore, we believe our approach to fulfilling the Cures Act requirement\nfor pediatric health care providers and settings, which involves identifying existing, new, or\nrevised 2015 Edition criteria – as applicable to an identified clinical or interoperability priority –\n\n\n\n\nis appropriate across patient populations. We also note that our authority is limited to\nimplementing the described requirements of the Cures Act related to pediatric settings. We\ncannot speak for the actions of other Federal agencies, but would note once again that we have\ntaken a limited regulatory approach to implementing the pediatric provisions of the Cures Act.\n\n*Comments.* We received multiple comments requesting clarification on the intended use\nand functionality of the Certified Health IT Products List (CHPL) for pediatric certification, such\nas guidance on navigating the CHPL to identify relevant products based on pediatric care\nsettings.\n\n*Response.* We thank stakeholders for their comments on the CHPL. We do not intend to\nhave a separate tag functionality on the CHPL that identifies a product specifically for pediatric\ncare. We did not propose, and do not intend, for there to be a separate certification pathway or a\nnew ONC certification designation called pediatric certification. However, we recognize that\nbeyond certification and testing there are certain implementation needs that are important for\npediatric care and services. We agree with the overwhelming prior feedback from stakeholders\nstating that they should not have to purchase separate products that contain universally\napplicable functionality, such as the “API functionality” certification criteria. We are exploring\noptions for non-regulatory informational resources on effective implementation of health IT for\nuse by pediatric health providers to expand the availability of health IT products supporting the\ncare of children.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments regarding how the approach for voluntary\ncertification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers might be applicable to other\nmedical specialties and use cases. One commenter noted that the pediatric experience is scalable\nand should be extended to other disciplines. Another commenter sought clarification if this\nmodel could be used for broad applicability to multiple medical specialties such as pathologists.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank these commenters for identifying the applicability of our approach to\npediatrics to other medical specialties. We confirm that our approach for advancing health IT can\nbe used for other use cases and medical specialties, and welcome the opportunity to engage with\nstakeholders representing a wide range of medical specialties or sites of service to provide\ninsight into this process and to inform stakeholder-led efforts to improve clinically-relevant\nhealth IT implementation across specialties and settings of care.\n\n\n",

              "text": "Over the past ten years, a number of initiatives have focused on the availability and use\nof effective health IT tools and resources for pediatric care. These have included a number of\npublic-private partnerships including efforts between HHS, State agencies, and health\nsystems for innovative projects that range from care coordination enterprise solutions to\nimmunization information systems and to point of care solutions for specialty needs. In order to\nlearn from and build upon these efforts, ONC has engaged with stakeholders in both the public\nand private sector including other Federal, State and local government partners, health care\nproviders engaged in the care of children, standards developing organizations, charitable\nfoundations engaged in children’s health care research, and health IT developers supporting\npediatric care settings. For example, significant work has been done by the Agency for\nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), CMS, the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration (HRSA), and organizations around the Children’s EHR Format (Children’s\nFormat), which is critical to any discussion of the pediatric health IT landscape.69\nThe Children’s Format was authorized by the 2009 Children’s Health Insurance Program\n69\nAgency for Health Care Information and Technology. Health Information Technology.\nhttp://healthit.ahrq.gov/health-it-tools-and-resources/childrens-electronic-health-record-ehr-format Accessed\nSeptember, 2017.\n\n\n\n\nReauthorization Act (CHIPRA)70\nand developed by AHRQ in close collaboration with CMS. It\nwas developed to bridge the gap between the functionality present in most EHRs currently\navailable and the functionality that could optimally support the care of children. Specifically, the\nChildren’s Format provides information to EHR system developers and others about critical\nfunctionality and other requirements that are helpful to include in an EHR system to address\nhealth care needs specific to the care of children. The final version of the Children’s Format,\nreleased in 2015, consists of 47 high priority functional requirements in 19 topic areas that focus\non improvements that would better support the safety and quality of care delivered to children.\n\nThe Children’s Format was intended as a starting point for developers, users, and purchasers for\ninforming an approach for pediatric voluntary certification. We refer to the Voluntary Edition\nproposed rule for a description of our prior discussion around the Children’s Format (79 FR\n10930).\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reviewed the 2015\nChildren’s Format using a robust analytical process and engagement with their members. The\nresult was a prioritized list of eight clinical priorities to support pediatric health care (“Priority\nList”). In October 2017, we held a technical discussion with stakeholders titled “Health IT for\nPediatrics” with the specific purpose of obtaining input from an array of stakeholders in an effort\nto draw correlations between the pediatric providers’ clinical priorities identified in the Priority\nList with the detailed technical requirements outlined in the Children’s Format and the\ncapabilities and standards that could be included in certified health IT. Through this collaborative\napproach, the meeting participants identified a set of priority needs for health IT to support\npediatric care based upon those identified by the Priority List and the primary correlation to the\n70\nP.L. 111-3, section 401 https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/citation/children-ehr-format-enhancement-final-\nrecommendation-report-abridged.pdf\n\n\n\n\nChildren’s Format.\n\n\n",

These additional recommendations, which may be supported by certified health IT,\nare as follows:\n Recommendation 9: Track incomplete preventative care opportunities\n Recommendation 10: Flag special health care needs\n\n\n\n\nIn order to implement the second part of section 4001(b) of the Cures Act for the\nadoption of certification criteria to support the voluntary certification of health IT for use by\npediatric health care providers, we identified both the 2015 Edition certification criteria and the\nnew or revised certification criteria proposed in the Proposed Rule that support the 10\nrecommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers\nto support the health care of children. In the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7459), we directed readers to\nthe appendix of the Proposed Rule for a set of technical worksheets, which include a crosswalk\nof the various criteria specifically associated with each recommendation.

The already adopted 2015 Edition criteria are as follows:\n “API functionality” criteria (§ 170.315(g)(7)-(g)(9)) which address many of the\nchallenges currently faced by patients and by caregivers such as parents or guardians\naccessing child’s health information, including the “multiple portal” problem, by\npotentially allowing individuals to aggregate health information from multiple sources\nin a web or mobile application of their choice.\n\n “Care plan” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(9)) which supports pediatric care by facilitating\nthe documentation of electronic health information in a structured format to improve\ncare coordination (80 FR 62648 and 62649).\n\n “Clinical decision support” (CDS) criterion (§ 170.315(a)(9)) which supports\npediatric care by enabling interventions based on the capture of biometric data.\n\n “Common Clinical Data Set” (§ 170.315(b)(4) and § 170.315(b)(5)) which includes\noptional pediatric vital sign data elements including as optional the reference\nrange/growth curve for three pediatric vital signs--BMI percent per LOINC identifiers\nfor age per sex, weight per length/sex, and head occipital-frontal circumference for\nchildren less than three years of age.\n\n “Data segmentation for privacy” send criterion and receive criterion (§ 170.315(b)(7) and\n§ 170.315(b)(8)) which provides the ability to: create a summary record that is tagged at\nthe document level as restricted and subject to re-disclosure; receive a summary record\nthat is document-level tagged as restricted; separate the document-level tagged document\n\n\n\n\nfrom other documents received; and view the restricted document without having to\nincorporate any of the data from the document.\n\n “Demographics” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) which supports pediatric care through\nthe capture of values and value sets relevant for the pediatric health care setting as\nwell as allowing for improved patient matching which is a key challenge for pediatric\ncare.\n\n “Electronic Prescribing” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)) which includes an optional\nStructured and Codified Sig Format, which has the capability to exchange weight-based\ndosing calculations within the NCPDP SCRIPT 10.6 standard and limits the ability to\nprescribe all oral, liquid medications in only metric standard units of mL (i.e., not cc)\nimportant for enabling safe prescribing practices for children.\n\n “Family health history” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)) which supports pediatric care\nbecause it leverages concepts or expressions for familial conditions, which are\nespecially clinically relevant when caring for children.\n\n “Patient health information capture” criterion (§ 170.315(e)(3)) which supports\nproviders’ ability to accept health information from a patient or authorized\nrepresentative. This criterion could support pediatric care through documentation of\ndecision-making authority of a patient representative.\n\n “Social, psychological, and behavioral data” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(15)) which\nsupports integration of behavioral health data into a child’s record across the care\ncontinuum by enabling a user to record, change, and access a patient’s social,\npsychological, and behavioral data based using SNOMED CT® and LOINC® codes.\n\n “Transitions of care” criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)) which supports structured transition\n\n\n\n\nof care summaries and referral summaries that help ensure the coordination and\ncontinuity of health care as children transfer between different clinicians at different\nhealth care organizations or different levels of care within the same health care\norganization.\n\n “Transmission to immunization registries” criterion (§ 170.315(f)(1)) which supports\nthe safe and effective provision of child health care through immunizations and registry\nlinkages. This criterion also provides the ability to request, access, and display the\nevaluated immunization history and forecast from an immunization registry for a\npatient. Immunization forecasting recommendations allow for providers to access the\nmost complete and up-to-date information on a patient's immunization history to inform\ndiscussions about what vaccines a patient may need based on nationally recommended\nimmunization recommendations (80 FR 62662 through 62664).\n\n “View, download, and transmit to 3rd party” (VDT) criterion (§ 170.315(e)(1)) which\nsupports transferrable access authority for the pediatric health care setting and\nprovides the ability for patients (and their authorized representatives)72\nto view,\ndownload, and transmit their health information to a 3rd party.\n\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7460) that some of these criteria may be updated\nbased on proposals contained in the Proposed Rule (see further discussion below on new or\nrevised certification criteria); and stated that we continue to believe that prior to any such\nupdates, technology that is currently available and certified to these 2015 Edition criteria can\n72\nThe VDT criterion includes a “patient-authorized representative” concept that aligns with the use of the term\nunder the EHR Incentive Program. A “patient-authorized representative” is defined as any individual to whom the\npatient has granted access to their health information (see also 77 FR 13720). However, consent is not needed for\nminors, for whom existing local, state, or Federal law grants their parents or guardians access (see also 77 FR\n13720).\n\n\n\n\nmake a significant impact in supporting providers engaged in the health care of children. We\ninvited readers to use the technical worksheets in the appendix of the Proposed Rule to inform\ntheir public comment on the recommendations, the inclusion of specific items from the\nChildren’s Format, and the identified 2015 Edition certification criteria as they relate specifically\nto use cases for pediatric care and sites of service.\n\n\n",

These proposed criteria and standards include:\n New API criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) which would serve to implement the Cures Act\nrequirement to permit health information to be accessed, exchanged, and used from\nAPIs without special effort.\n\n New “DS4P” criteria (two for C-CDA ((§ 170.315(b)(12)) and (§ 170.315(b)(13)) and one\nfor FHIR (§ 170.315(g)(11))) that would support a more granular approach to privacy\ntagging data for health information exchange supported by either the C-CDA or FHIR-\nbased exchange standards.\n\n New electronic prescribing certification criterion (§ 170.315(b)(11)), which would\nsupport improved patient safety and prescription accuracy, workflow efficiencies, and\nincreased configurability of systems including functionality that could support pediatric\nmedication management.\n\n USCDI (§ 170.213) and USCDI-based criteria which enables the inclusion of pediatric\n\n\n\n\nvital sign data elements, including the reference range/scale or growth curve for BMI\npercentile per age and sex, weight for age per length and sex, and head occipital-frontal\ncircumference. Each of the new or revised certification criteria and standards are further\ndescribed in other sections of this final rule, including all final actions related to the\ncriteria (some of which are described below in the response to comments).\n\n*Comments.* A majority of comments received supported our recommendations for the\nvoluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers to support the health care\nof children along with the alignment with the Children’s Format and 2015 Edition certification\ncriteria. Several commenters suggested that the 10 recommendations should only be the first step\nand encouraged future development of additional recommendations using the Children’s Format.\n\nCommenters were also pleased with the 10 recommendations selected by ONC from the\nChildren’s Format stating that they represent a strong, positive step forward for improving EHRs\nused in the care of children. Many commenters stated that they support the continued alignment\nwith the 2015 Edition recommendations.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and feedback. As such, we have\nmaintained the 10 recommendations for the voluntary certification of health IT for use by\npediatric health providers to support the health care of children. We have finalized in this final\nrule the majority of the aligned proposed new 2015 Edition certification criteria that support the\nvoluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health providers, with the exception of\nthe proposed criterion for “consent management” in § 170.315(g)(11) since we did not finalize\nour proposal for the criterion in this final rule. The functionality of the proposed new “DS4P”\ncriteria have been incorporated into the already adopted 2015 Edition DS4P criteria DS4P-send\n(§ 170.315(b)(7)) and DS4P-receive (§ 170.315(b)(8)) now referred to as “Security tags –\nSummary of Care- send” and “Security tags – Summary of Care – receive,” respectively. The\n\n\n\n\nfunctionality of the proposed new e-Rx criterion was also incorporated in the already adopted e-\nRx criterion (§ 170.315(b)(3)). Last, we have removed the “Common Clinical Data Set” (§\n170.315(b)(4) and § 170.315(b)(5)) from the 2015 Edition in this final rule.\n\nWe note that we are aware that the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard Version 2017071\nImplementation Guide contains a number of requirements intended to improve accurate dosing\nand pediatric patient safety. One such requirement is the inclusion of the most recent patient\nheight and weight in the Observation Segment on all new and renewal prescriptions sent from\nthe prescriber to the pharmacy, along with the date associated with these measures, for all\npatients 18 years old and younger. We are also aware of the challenges that such a requirement\nmay pose on specific providers and under certain circumstances where height and/or weight is\nnot required or applicable for dosing of the product. We believe additional work must be done on\nrefining this requirement, and will continue to monitor standards and industry advancements\nbefore proposing such a requirement. At this time, we recommend vital signs to be included in\nall electronic prescriptions for all patient populations when available and where applicable.\n\nThe 10 recommendations and the aligned 2015 Edition certification criteria support the\nhealth IT needs of pediatric care providers. We believe further support can be provided through\nnon-regulatory informational resources. These resources can help inform technical and\nimplementation specifications for health IT developers and products for use by pediatric health\nproviders to support the health care of children. We also agree with commenters that the 10\nrecommendations are a first step and welcome input and collaboration from the health IT\nindustry and health care providers to continue efforts to develop and build a health IT\ninfrastructure supporting pediatric care and other specialty care and sites of service across the\ncontinuum.\n\n\n",

If these\nrequirements are not met, the health IT developer may no longer be able to participate in the\n\n\n\n\nProgram and/or its certified health IT may have its certification terminated. We proposed to\nimplement each Condition of Certification requirement with further specificity as it applies to the\nProgram. We also proposed to establish Maintenance of Certification requirements for certain\nConditions of Certification requirements as standalone requirements. As we stated in the\nProposed Rule, this approach would establish clear baseline technical and behavior Conditions of\nCertification requirements with evidence that the Conditions of Certification requirements are\ncontinually being met through the Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments expressing general support for the concept of\nrequiring Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.

We provide further details on each of\nthe Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements within their respective subsections\nin this section of the final rule. However, to clarify our approach to the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements in response to comments, the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements, except for the “information blocking” and\n“assurances” Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, apply only to actions\nand behaviors of health IT developers related to their certified health IT as well as to the certified\nhealth IT itself. For the “information blocking” and “assurances” Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements, consistent with the Cures Act provisions and our implementation of\nsection 3022(a) (information blocking) of the PHSA, a health IT developer is also responsible to\nensure that all of its health IT and related actions and behaviors do not constitute information\n\n\n\n\nblocking or inhibit the appropriate access, exchange, and use of electronic health information\n(EHI).

This has always been an expectation of\nONC and users of certified health IT and, importantly, a requirement of the Program. As stated\nin the Proposed Rule, we believe that by incorporating this expectation as an explicit Condition\nof Certification requirement under the Program, there would be assurances, and documentation\nvia the “Attestations” Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements proposed in §\n170.406, that all health IT developers fully understand their responsibilities under the Program,\nincluding not to take any action with their certified health IT that may inhibit the appropriate\nexchange, access, and use of EHI. To this point, certification criteria are designed and issued so\nthat certified health IT can support interoperability and the appropriate exchange, access, and use\nof EHI.\n\n\n\n\nWe also proposed that, as a complementary Condition of Certification requirement,\nhealth IT developers of certified health IT must provide an assurance that they have made\ncertified capabilities available in ways that enable them to be implemented and used in\nproduction environments for their intended purposes. More specifically, developers would be\nprohibited from taking any action that could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use\ncertified capabilities for any purpose within the scope of the technology’s certification. Such\nactions may inhibit the appropriate access, exchange, or use of EHI and are therefore contrary to\nthis proposed Condition of Certification requirement. While such actions are already prohibited\nunder the Program (80 FR 62711), making these existing requirements that prohibit developers\nfrom taking any action that could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use certified\ncapabilities for any purpose within the scope of the technology’s certification explicit in this\nCondition of Certification requirement will ensure that health IT developers are required to attest\nto them pursuant to the Attestations Condition of Certification requirement in § 170.406, which\nwill in turn provide additional assurances to the Secretary that developers of certified health IT\nsupport and do not inhibit appropriate access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\nAs discussed at 84 FR 7466 in our Proposed Rule, actions that would violate this\nCondition of Certification requirement include failing to fully deploy or enable certified\ncapabilities; imposing limitations (including restrictions) on the use of certified capabilities once\ndeployed; or requiring subsequent developer assistance to enable the use of certified capabilities,\ncontrary to the intended uses and outcomes of those capabilities). The Condition of Certification\nrequirement would also be violated were a developer to refuse to provide documentation,\nsupport, or other assistance reasonably necessary to enable the use of certified capabilities for\ntheir intended purposes. More generally, any action that would be likely to substantially impair\nthe ability of one or more users (or prospective users) to implement or use certified capabilities\n\n\n\n\nfor any purpose within the scope of applicable certification criteria would be prohibited by this\nCondition of Certification requirement. Such actions may include imposing limitations or\nadditional types of costs, especially if these were not disclosed when a customer purchased or\nlicensed the certified health IT.\n\n*Comments.* We received a comment recommending additional language to allow health\nIT developers to be able to provide an explanation of how their software conforms to the\ncertification criteria requirements and how they enable the appropriate exchange, access, and use\nof EHI.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for their input, but do not accept the\nrecommendation. Health IT must comply with certification criteria as specified in regulation. We\nalso refer readers to the “Attestations” Condition of Certification requirement in this section of\nthe preamble for more information regarding how we proposed to provide flexibilities, including\na method for health IT developers to indicate their compliance, noncompliance, or the\ninapplicability of each Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement as it applies to\nall of their health IT certified under the Program, as well as the flexibility to specify\nnoncompliance per certified Health IT Module, if necessary. As such, we have finalized the Full\nCompliance and Unrestricted Implementation of Certification Criteria Capabilities Condition of\nCertification requirement as proposed that a health IT developer must ensure that its health IT\ncertified under the Program conforms to the full scope of the certification criteria to which its\nhealth IT is certified, and that health IT developers would be prohibited from taking any action\nthat could interfere with a user’s ability to access or use certified capabilities for any purpose\nwithin the scope of the technology’s certification. We note that because compliance with the\ninformation blocking section of this final rule (Part 171) is not required until six months after the\npublication date of the final rule, § 170.402(a)(1) also has a six-month delayed compliance date.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters requested clarification on whether requiring\nsubsequent developer assistance to enable the use of certain certified capabilities would be\nconsidered noncompliance with the Condition of Certification requirement, such as managed\nservices, hosting, connecting with exchange networks, or outsourced arrangements under\nagreement.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that the purpose of this Condition of Certification requirement is to\nmake certified capabilities available in ways that enable them to be implemented and used in\nproduction environments for their intended purposes. As stated above, the Condition of\nCertification requirement would be violated were a developer to refuse to provide\ndocumentation, support, or other assistance reasonably necessary to enable the use of certified\ncapabilities for their intended purposes (see 84 FR 7466). We do not believe that actions by\nhealth IT developers to provide their customers with education, implementation, and connection\nassistance to integrate certified capabilities for their customers would typically constitute actions\nthat interfere with a customer’s ability to use certified capabilities for their intended purposes,\nbut in the absence of specific facts, we cannot say that whether there are scenarios that would\nresult in the assistance interfering with a user’s ability to access or use certified capabilities for\nany purpose within the scope of the health IT’s certification. As such, education and other\nassistance may be offered, but care should be taken to do so in a manner that minds the\nCondition of Certification requirement standards.\n\n*Comments.* We received a comment asking that health IT developers be required to\nprovide honest communication and expert advice as required by a user.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenter’s suggestion regarding honest communication\nand expert advice. However, such a requirement would not be consistent with this Condition of\nCertification requirement, which focuses on assurances that Health IT developers did not take\n\n\n\n\nactions that may inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health\ninformation (EHI). We also believe it would be difficult to enforce such a requirement in terms\nof determining what constitutes an “honest” communication and “expert advice.”\n\n\n",

As a\nMaintenance of Certification requirement, we proposed that a health IT developer that produces\nand electronically manages EHI must provide all of its customers of certified health IT Modules\nwith health IT certified to the functionality included in § 170.315(b)(10) within 24 months of a\nsubsequent final rule’s effective date or within 12 months of certification for a health IT\ndeveloper that never previously certified health IT to the 2015 Edition, whichever is longer.\n\nConsistent with these proposals, we also proposed to amend § 170.550 to require that ONC-\nACBs certify health IT to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” certification criterion when\nthe health IT developer of the health IT Module presented for certification produces and\nelectronically manages EHI. As discussed in section IV.C.1 of the Proposed Rule, the\navailability of the capabilities in the “EHI export” certification criterion promote access,\nexchange, and use of health information to facilitate electronic access to single patient and\npatient population health information in cases such as a patient requesting their information, or a\nhealth care provider switching health IT systems. As such, health IT developers with health IT\nproducts that have health IT Modules certified to the finalized “EHI export” certification\nrequirement must make this functionality available to customers and provide assurances that the\ndeveloper is not taking actions that constitute information blocking or any other action that may\ninhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of health information. We discussed the EHI\nexport functionality in section IV.B.4 of the Proposed Rule.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters expressed their support for the Condition of\nCertification requirement, noting that certifying health IT to § 170.315(b)(10) would provide\ngreater EHI access to end users. Several commenters requested extending the implementation\ntimeframe to 36 months stating that more time is needed for analysis, product development, and\ntesting, with an additional 12 months for client adoption, testing, and training. A couple of\ncommenters supported the 24-month timeframe, but stated that they did not support ONC\ndictating the adoption schedule for providers, and that the proposal does not consider the efforts\nrequired from providers to plan and execute effective implementation and adoption. One\ncommenter stated that 24 months is not aggressive enough and that the rule should prioritize\ncertain aspects of patient-directed exchange and make these available in 12 months or less.\n\nAnother commenter suggested that we narrow the type of health IT developer that must certify\nhealth IT to § 170.315(b)(10), noting that some Health IT Modules may manage data produced\nby other Health IT Modules, or received and incorporated from other sources. We did not receive\nany comments specific to our proposal to amend § 170.550 to require that ONC-ACBs certify\nhealth IT to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI export” criterion when the health IT developer of\nthe health IT Module presented for certification produces and electronically manages EHI.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their support. In response to comments\nregarding scope of data export under this criterion, we have modified the proposed “EHI export”\ncertification criterion and scope of data export. In doing so, we have also revised our Condition\nof Certification requirement, which we have finalized in § 170.402(a)(4), that a health IT\ndeveloper of a certified Health IT Module that is part of a health IT product which electronically\nstores EHI must certify to the certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). Additionally, we clarify\nthat in attesting to § 170.406, a health IT developer must attest accurately in accordance with §\n170.402(a)(4) and (b)(2) if the health IT developer certified a Health IT Module(s) that is part of\n\n\n\n\na health IT product which can store EHI. The finalized criterion focuses on the Health IT\nModule’s ability to export EHI for the health IT product’s single and patient population, which\nencompasses the EHI that can be stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the\nHealth IT Module is a part. To note, we do not require developers to disclose proprietary\ninformation about their products. Also, as clarified above and in § 170.315(b)(10)(iii), we do not\nrequire any specific standards for the export format(s) used to support the export functionality.\n\nIn regards to when health IT developers must provide all of their users of certified health\nIT with health IT certified to the functionality included in § 170.315(b)(10), we have removed\nthe proposed language “within 12 months of certification for a health IT developer that never\npreviously certified health IT to the 2015 Edition, whichever is longer.” Our intention was to\nprovide equity between existing and new health IT developers. However, we have concluded that\nnew health IT developers will not be at a disadvantage to meet the same timeline considering all\nhealth IT developers will be aware of requirements necessary for certification when this final\nrule is published. We also acknowledge the concerns expressed regarding the 24-month\ntimeframe and have extended the compliance timeline to within 36 months of the final rule’s\npublication date, as finalized in § 170.402(b)(2)(i). With the narrowed scope of data export for\nthe criterion, we believe health IT developers should be able to provide all of their customers of\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(10) with the export functionality included in §\n170.315(b)(10) within 36 months. We have also finalized in § 170.402(b)(2)(ii) that on and after\n36 months from the publication of this final rule, health IT developers that must comply with the\nrequirements of § 170.402(a)(4) must provide all of their customers of certified health IT with\nhealth IT certified to § 170.315(b)(10). From this milestone forward, a health IT developer’s\nparticipation in the Certification Program obligates them to provide the technical capabilities\nexpressed in § 170.315(b)(10) when they provide such certified health IT to their customers. We\n\n\n\n\nwill monitor ongoing compliance with this Condition and Maintenance of Certification through a\nvariety of means including, but not limited to, developer attestations pursuant to § 170.406,\nhealth IT developers real world testing plans, response to user complaints, and ONC-ACB\nsurveillance activities.\n\nConsistent with the above revisions and in alignment with our proposal to amend §\n170.550, we have also amended § 170.550(g)(5) regarding Health IT Module dependent criteria\nfor consistency with the requirements of § 170.402(a)(4) and (b)(2) when a Health IT Module\npresented for certification is part of a health IT product which can store electronic health\ninformation. In addition, we have amended § 170.550(m)(2) to only allow ONC-ACBs to issue\ncertifications to § 170.315(b)(6) until 36 months after the publication date of this final rule. Thus,\nONC-ACBs may issue certificates for either § 170.315(b)(6) or (b)(10) up until 36 months after\nthe publication date of this final rule, but on and after 36 months they may only issue certificates\nfor Health IT Modules in accordance with § 170.315(b)(10). We note that ONC-ACBs are\nrequired by their ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation to have processes in place to meet the\nexpectations and minimum requirements of the Program. Thus, ONC-ACBs are expected to have\nprocesses in place in order to effectively monitor these timeline requirements on and after 36\nmonths after the publication of this rule, and to additionally ensure that the health IT developer\nattests accurately to § 170.402(a)(4) and (b)(2). Should a developer fail to comply, the ONC-\nACB will follow its processes to institute corrective action and report to ONC in accordance with\nProgram reporting requirements in 45 CFR 170.523(f)(1)(xxii). In the event the developer does\nnot follow through with the corrective action plan established and approved with the ONC-ACB,\nthe ONC-ACB must alert ONC of the health IT developer’s failure to comply with the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested ONC add functionality to the CHPL (or in another\n\n\n\n\nformat) that provides a list of the start and end dates of each previously certified Health IT\nModule.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this suggestion and note that the CHPL already lists\ncertification dates for certified Health IT Modules, including the dates the Health IT Module was\nlast modified, decertified, or made inactive.\n\n\n",

In other words, records and information should be retained starting\nfrom the date a developer first certifies health IT under the Program and applies separately to\neach unique Health IT Module (or Complete EHR, as applicable) certified under the Program.\n\nThis retention of records is necessary to verify health IT developer compliance with Program\nrequirements, including certification criteria and Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. As stated in the Proposed Rule, 10 years is an appropriate period of time given that\nmany users of certified health IT participate in various CMS programs, as well as other\nprograms, that require similar periods of records retention.\n\nIn an effort to reduce administrative burden, we also proposed, that in situations where\napplicable certification criteria are removed from the Code of Federal Regulations before the 10\nyears have expired, records must only be kept for 3 years from the date of removal for those\ncertification criteria and related Program provisions unless that timeframe would exceed the\noverall 10-year retention period.

A couple commenters requested clarification on when the records and information\nretention requirement would take effect. One commenter requested clarification regarding the\nrole of health IT developers that no longer maintain a certified Health IT Module or have their\ncertification suspended. One commenter recommended setting a retention period for record\nkeeping in the event that a health IT developer removes a Health IT Module from market to\nensure that potentially short lived Health IT Modules would inadvertently not have their\ndocumentation maintained.\n\n*Response.* We have adopted our proposal in § 170.402(b)(1) without revisions. We\ncontinue to believe that 10 years is an appropriate period of time given that many users of\ncertified health IT participate in various CMS programs, as well as other programs, that require\nsimilar periods of records retention.

We clarify\nthat health IT developers are best situated to determine what records and information in their\npossession would demonstrate their compliance with all of the relevant Program requirements.\n\nWe note that it is our understanding that health IT developers are already retaining the majority\nof their records and information for the purposes of ONC-ACB surveillance and ONC direct\n\n\n\n\nreview under the Program.

In regard to the requested clarification for the role of\nhealth IT developers that no longer maintain a certified Health IT Module or have their\ncertification suspended, a health IT developer who does not have any certified Health IT\nModules within the Program would no longer have any obligation to retain records and\ninformation for the purposes of the Program. However, we note that it may be in the health IT\ndeveloper’s best interest to retain their records and information. For example, records may be\nuseful for health IT developers in any potential investigation or enforcement action taken outside\nof the ONC Health IT Certification Program such as by the HHS Office of the Inspector General\n(e.g., information blocking) or the U.S. Department of Justice (e.g., False Claims Act).\n\n\n",

                  "text": "The Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirement under the Program, does not prohibit or restrict communication\nregarding the following subjects:\n\n\n\n\n The usability of the health information technology;\n The interoperability of the health information technology;\n The security of the health information technology;\n Relevant information regarding users' experiences when using the health information\ntechnology;\n The business practices of developers of health information technology related to exchanging\nelectronic health information; and\n The manner in which a user of the health information technology has used such technology.\n\nThe Cures Act established the broad communications protections delineated above\n(referred to hereafter as “protected communications”) and we proposed in 84 FR 7467 to\nimplement this general prohibition against developers imposing prohibitions and restrictions on\nprotected communications in § 170.403.\n\nWe also recognized that there are circumstances where it is both legitimate and reasonable\nfor developers to limit the sharing of information about their health IT. As such, we proposed to\nallow developers to impose prohibitions or restrictions on protected communications in certain\nnarrowly defined circumstances. In order for a prohibition or restriction on a protected\ncommunication to be permitted, we proposed in 84 FR 7467 that it must pass a two-part test. First,\nthe communication that is being prohibited or restricted must not fall within a class of\ncommunications (hereafter referred to as “communications with unqualified protection”) that is\nconsidered to always be legitimate or reasonable—such as communications required by law,\nmade to a government agency, or made to a defined category of safety organizations. Second, to\nbe permitted, a developer’s prohibition or restriction on communications must also fall within a\ncategory of communications (hereafter referred to as “permitted prohibitions and restrictions”) for\n\n\n\n\nwhich it is both legitimate and reasonable for a developer to limit the sharing of information about\nits health IT. This would be because of the nature of the relationship between the developer and\nthe communicator or because of the nature of the information that is, or could be, the subject of\nthe communication. We proposed that a developer’s restriction or prohibition that does not satisfy\nthis two-part test would contravene the Communications Condition of Certification requirement.\n\nWe note that this two-part test strikes a reasonable balance between the need to promote open\ncommunication about health IT and related business practices, and the need to protect the\nlegitimate interests of health IT developers and other entities.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of public comments we received supported the proposed\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements, with many commenters expressing\nstrong support. Commenters stated that the proposed requirements would enable better\ncommunication that would improve health IT and patient care. Some commenters who supported\nthe proposed requirements sought clarification or had specific concerns, including regarding the\nproposed deadlines for contract modification. These matters are discussed in more detail below.\n\nAdditionally, a handful of public comments strongly opposed the proposed requirements,\nprimarily based on concerns regarding intellectual property (IP).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the overall strong support for the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements as proposed and have finalized with modifications in § 170.403. We\nalso recognize the need to provide clarification regarding some aspects of the requirements,\nincluding regarding the protections available for IP that are included in the Communications\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\nWe emphasize that, under section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA, participation in the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program (Program) is voluntary. In other words, ONC cannot compel\nhealth IT developers to participate in the Program nor can ONC impose consequences (e.g.,\n\n\n\n\nenforcement actions or penalties) on health IT developers who choose not to participate in the\nProgram. The requirements of the Program are much like requirements for any other voluntary\ncontract or agreement an entity would enter into with the Federal Government. Through the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we have essentially offered developers\nterms for participation in the Program that we believe are appropriate based on: our statutory\ninstruction and interpretation of the Cures Act; the utility and necessity of using intellectual\nproperty, including screenshots, to communicate issues with usability, user experience,\ninteroperability, security, or the way the technology is used (and relatedly, the real and substantial\nthreat to public health and safety resulting from prohibitions and/or restrictions on the\ncommunication of screenshots); and the measured approach we have taken throughout the\nCommunications Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (which is discussed in\ndetail in this section). Because the Program is voluntary, developers have the option to agree to\nthe terms we have offered or to choose not to participate in the Program. As such, we believe our\npolicies concerning intellectual property, including the use of screenshots, are consistent with\nother laws and regulations that govern terms for voluntary contracts and agreements with the\nFederal Government. Further, we believe that the final provisions of this Condition of\nCertification include appropriate consideration of health IT developers’ intellectual property\nrights.\n\nWe further discuss the various aspects of the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements, as well as the changes we have made to our proposals, in more detail below.\n\n\n",

These practices result in a lack of transparency\nthat can contribute to and exacerbate patient safety risks, system security vulnerabilities, and\nhealth IT performance issues.\n\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the challenges presented by health IT developer\nactions that prohibit or restrict communications have been examined for some time.

Similarly, we proposed\nthat these Condition of Certification requirements do not impose any limit on the identity of the\ncommunicators that are able to benefit from the protection afforded, except that employees and\ncontractors of a health IT developer may be treated differently when making communications that\nare not afforded unqualified protection under § 170.403(a)(2)(i). For example, we proposed that\nthis Condition of Certification’s requirements are not limited to communications by health IT\ncustomers (e.g., providers) who have contracts with health IT developers.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters addressed the scope of protected communications in their\ncomments. Several commenters suggested that the proposed scope of protected communications\nwas too broad. Other commenters stated that the scope should be clarified. One commenter\nsuggested that the scope of private communications that can be shared should be limited and that\nONC should require mutual consent for such communications to be made public.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. The Cures Act identifies a list of subject areas\nabout which health IT developers cannot prohibit or restrict communications to meet the\nconditions for certification. The terms we proposed for the protected subject areas are taken from\nthe language in section 4002 of the Cures Act and include:\n The usability of the health information technology;\n The interoperability of the health information technology;\n The security of the health information technology;\n Relevant information regarding users’ experiences when using the health information\ntechnology;\n The business practices of developers of health information technology related to exchanging\nelectronic health information; and\n\n\n\n\n The manner in which a user of the health information technology has used such technology.\n\nWe continue to interpret the above statutory terms broadly, but within the limiting\nframework we proposed, which includes a distinction between communications entitled to\nunqualified protections and those communications not entitled to such protection. We have,\nhowever, finalized some provisions with further limiting and clarifying language as well as\nprovided examples to improve understanding of the provisions.\n\nWe decline to create a consent requirement as part of the requirements of this Condition of\nCertification because such a requirement could unnecessarily encumber vital communications\nprotected by the Cures Act. As highlighted above, the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements are intended to enable unencumbered communication about usability,\ninteroperability, and other critical issues with health IT, and a consent requirement would chill the\nability of users of health IT to engage in that communication as well as be contrary to section\n4002 of the Cures Act.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements should apply only to certified health IT, recommending that ONC clarify that the\nuse of “the health IT” refers only to the developer’s health IT that is certified under the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program. The commenter stated that the use of “the health IT” in the\nCures Act can only be reasonably interpreted as referring to the health IT for which a developer is\nseeking certification, not all of the developer’s health IT. Another commenter stated that other\nhealth IT, such as billing systems, should be out of scope of this requirement and noted that to do\notherwise would create a regulatory imbalance between developers of such health IT who also\noffer certified health IT and those who do not.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments regarding restricting the applicability of the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements to certified health IT. We clarify that, as\n\n\n\n\nwith all of the Conditions of Certification requirements, the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements apply to developers of health IT certified under the Program and to the\nconduct of such developers with respect to health IT certified under the Program. By way of\nexample, if a developer had health IT certified under the Program and also had health IT that was\nnot certified under the Program, then only those communications about the certified health IT\nwould be covered by the Communications Condition of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment requesting more specificity on the definition of\ncommunicators covered by the Communications Condition of Certification requirements. The\ncommenter expressed concern that the broad scope could impact the ability to maintain\nconfidentiality in traditional business-to-business relationships.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment and understand the concern noted by the\ncommenter. As stated in the Proposed Rule and finalized in § 170.403, the Communications\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements generally do not impose any limit on\nthe identity of communicators that are able to benefit from the protection afforded. We also note\nthat there are limited exceptions where communications by certain communicators can be\nrestricted. Specifically, as finalized in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(A), health IT developers can place\nlimited restrictions on communications by employees and contractors. We believe this will enable\ntraditional business-to-business relationships to continue without undue disruption, including\nallowing implementation of non-disclosure agreements or other contracts as necessary to maintain\nconfidentiality.\nii. Protected Subject Areas\nComments. We received several comments requesting that we clarify how the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements would apply to communications\nregarding public health reporting, including communications made by public health authorities.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We emphasize that the Cures Act identified a list of subject areas about which\nwe were required to forbid developers from prohibiting or restricting communications. Though\npublic health reporting was not specifically covered by the Cures Act or our proposed regulations,\nit may be that certain public health communications will fall within the categories established by\nthe statute. We also note that one of the “communications with unqualified protection” discussed\nlater in this section is for communicating information about adverse events, hazards, and other\nunsafe conditions to government agencies, health care accreditation organizations, and patient\nsafety organizations. Depending on the specific communication in question, a communication\nabout public health reporting or a communication made to public health authorities could be a\ncommunication that could not be restricted in any way. We also emphasize that, subject to limited\ncircumstances already discussed above, we do not impose any limit on the identity of the\ncommunicators that are able to benefit from protections afforded under the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements. Communicators are broadly defined and could include\npublic health agencies and authorities.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters had concerns regarding how a developer may address\ncommunications that contain false claims or libelous statements. Commenters discussed the need\nto enable health IT developers to—for example—refute false claims, deal with anonymous\nclaims, and restrict certain communications (such as false statements or communications\nprotected by attorney-client privilege). Some of these comments emphasized that false\ncommunications such as libel should not be protected, nor should communications sent by\nsomeone who obtained them illegally, such as a hacker. Some of the commenters recommended\nadding a category of communications that would never be protected under the proposed\nframework, and such communications would not receive unqualified protection or necessitate\npermitted restrictions. This would allow a developer to—for example—prohibit or restrict\n\n\n\n\ncommunications that are false or deceptive, would violate a law or court order, or would result in\na breach of contract.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by commenters regarding statements that\nmay be false or misleading. However, developers already have legal means and remedies\navailable to them to address such statements, and this rule does not change that. For example,\neach State has libel laws that address libelous or defamatory statements and provide remedies in\nsituations where the specific facts in a damaging statement can be proven to be untrue. We believe\nthat such statements are best addressed through those laws and that it is neither prudent nor\npractical for ONC to use the Program and the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements to attempt to assess such statements and make determinations as to their veracity.\n\nFurther, we note that the Communications Condition of Certification requirements only\nprovide that such protected communications cannot be restricted or prohibited. It is up to the\nhealth IT developer whether and how they choose to respond to the protected communication\nonce made. Therefore, we clarify that it is not a violation of the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements for developers to respond to false or unlawful comments under\napplicable law, as they do now, and to pursue litigation or any other available legal remedy in\nresponse to any protected communications that are covered by the Communications Condition of\nCertification. For example, it would not be a violation of the Communications Condition of\nCertification for a health IT developer who restricts the communication of screenshots as\npermitted under § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D) to pursue litigation for Copyright infringement or violation\nof contract if a “protected communication” disclosed more screenshots than the developer’s\nrestriction allowed.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that “safety” be added as a protected category\nor that ONC should include in the final rule a specific ban that prohibits any restrictions on\n\n\n\n\ncommunications about health IT-related patient safety. Additionally, several commenters noted\nthat ONC should include specific reporting methods or standards in the final rule to improve\nsafety reporting or add examples to help encourage reporting of safety and security issues. Several\ncommenters also requested that ONC develop protocols for reporting safety issues, and one\ncommenter recommended ONC develop a patient safety reporting system.\n\n*Response.* In implementing the Cures Act requirement that a health IT developer, as a\nCondition of Certification requirement under the Program, not restrict communications about\nhealth IT, we adhered to the list of protected subject areas identified by Congress in the Cures\nAct. Those subject areas include communications about “usability,” “relevant information\nregarding users’ experiences when using the health information technology,” and the “manner in\nwhich a user of the health information technology has used such technology.” We clarify that\npatient safety issues related to an interaction with the health IT could be covered in one or more of\nthose categories. Additionally, we agree with commenters that safety-related communications\nshould receive specific protections, and we emphasize that the communication of safety concerns\nis also addressed as a protected communication receiving “unqualified protection.” In the section\nof this final rule on “Communications with Unqualified Protection,” and in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)(B),\nwe state that communicating information about adverse events, hazards, and other unsafe\nconditions to government agencies, health care accreditation organizations, and patient safety\norganizations is a communication about which a developer would be prohibited from imposing\nany prohibition or restriction.\n\n(A) Usability of Health Information Technology\nThe term “usability” is not defined in the Cures Act, nor in any other relevant statutory\nprovisions. We proposed in 84 FR 7469 that the “usability” of health IT be construed broadly to\ninclude both an overall judgment on the “usability” of a particular certified health IT product by\n\n\n\n\nthe user, as well as any factor that contributes or may contribute to usability. We proposed that the\nfactors of usability that could be the subject of protected communications include, but are not\nlimited to, the following: the user interface (e.g., what a user sees on the screen, such as layout,\ncontrols, graphics and navigational elements); ease of use (e.g., how many clicks); how the\ntechnology supports users’ workflows; the organization of information; cognitive burden;\ncognitive support; error tolerance; clinical decision support; alerts; error handling;\ncustomizability; use of templates; mandatory data elements; the use of text fields; and customer\nsupport.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that “usability” is too broadly defined and should relate\nmore specifically to judgments on the ease of use of the health IT, rather than factors related to\nusability.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe that “usability” is inaccurately defined nor too broadly\ndefined. To define usability in the Proposed Rule, we referenced the NIST standard82\nas well as\nprinciples recognized by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).\n\nWe also emphasized that there are a multitude of factors that contribute to any judgment about\n“usability,” including factors contributing to the effectiveness, efficiency, and performance of the\nhealth IT. We have finalized the scope of the protected subject area “usability of its health IT” in\n§ 170.403(a)(1)(i) as proposed, providing that the “usability” of health IT be construed broadly to\ninclude both an overall judgment on the “usability” of a particular certified health IT product, as\nwell as any of the many factors that could contribute to usability as described in the Proposed\nRule. We also note that communications about the usability of health IT may include\ncommunications about features that are part of the certified health IT as well as communications\n82\nSee https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/health-it-usability\n\n\n\n\nabout what is not in the certified health IT (e.g., the absence of alerts or features that a user\nbelieves would aid in usability or are related to the other subject areas identified by the Cures\nAct).\n\n(B) Interoperability of Health Information Technology\nThe Cures Act, as codified in section 3000(9) of the PHSA, provides a definition of\n“interoperability” that describes a type of health IT that demonstrates the necessary capabilities to\nbe interoperable. For the purposes of the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements, we proposed that protected communications regarding the “interoperability of\nhealth IT” would include communications about whether certified health IT and associated\ndeveloper business practices meet the interoperability definition described in section 3000(9) of\nthe PHSA, including communications about aspects of the technology or developer that fall short\nof the expectations found in that definition. We stated that this would include communications\nabout the interoperability capabilities of health IT and the practices of a health IT developer that\nmay inhibit the access, exchange, or use of EHI, including information blocking. As previously\nnoted, Congress did not define the terms used in the Communications Conditions of Certification\nrequirements in section 4002(a) of the Cures Act and codified in section 3001(c)(5)(D)(iii) of the\nPHSA. We believe that “interoperability” was appropriately defined in the Proposed Rule by\nusing the interoperability definition that is located elsewhere in section 4003(a)(2) of the Cures\nAct and codified in section 3000(9) of the PHSA.\n\nWe did not receive comments about this aspect of the Proposed Rule, and we have\nfinalized the scope of the protected subject area “interoperability of its health IT” in §\n170.403(a)(1)(ii) as proposed above.\n\n(C) Security of Health IT\n\n\n\n\nThe security of health IT is addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule,83\nwhich establishes\nnational standards to protect individuals’ electronic protected health information (ePHI) that is\ncreated, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity or business associate (as defined\nat 45 CFR 160.103). Covered entities and business associates must ensure the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability of all ePHI; protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards\nto the security or integrity of such information; and protect against any reasonably anticipated\nuses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted or required under the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule. 84\nThe HIPAA Security Rule requires health IT developers, to the extent that they\nare business associates of covered entities, to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and\ntechnical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.85\nWe\nproposed in 84 FR 7469 that the matters that fall within the topic of health IT security should be\nbroadly construed to include any safeguards, whether or not required by the HIPAA Security\nRule, that may be implemented (or not implemented) by a developer to ensure the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability of EHI (information that includes ePHI), together with the certified\nhealth IT’s performance regarding security.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter noted that it is important that developers are able to remove\nposts on a website or forum that could compromise the security of health IT and recommended\nthat ONC explicitly allow developers to do so in the final rule.\n\n*Response.* We recognize the importance of protecting the security of EHI and health IT.\n\nWe also recognize that our engagement with stakeholders, as well as the language in section 4002\nof the Cures Act, emphasize the strong public interest in allowing unencumbered communications\n83 45 CFR part 160 and subparts A and C of Part 164.\n\n84 45 CFR part 160 and subparts A and C of Part 164.\n\n85 Id.\n\n\n\n\nregarding the protected subject areas and communications with unqualified protection, which are\ndiscussed in more detail below and in § 170.403(a)(2)(i). We emphasize that developers may\nrespond to communications as allowed under applicable law and may pursue any appropriate\nlegal remedy. Taking these factors into consideration, we decline at this time to explicitly allow\ndevelopers to restrict communications regarding security as suggested by the commenter.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested that ONC consider narrowing the permitted\ncommunication of security elements in § 170.403(a)(1)(iii) that might be used to compromise a\nparticular certified health IT’s security, for example restricting the sharing of authentication\ncredentials issued to a customer or user to access a system containing sensitive information such\nas PHI.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe it is necessary in this final rule to narrow or restrict the\ninformation that can be communicated where security elements are included in the\ncommunication. As stated above, we believe there is a strong public interest in allowing\nunencumbered communications regarding the protected subject areas and communications with\nunqualified protection. Further, assurances that access credentials and PHI communicated under\nthese circumstances will not be shared inappropriately are addressed in the HIPAA Security Rule\nand relevant State laws, and this rule does not change those protections.\n\n*Comments.* One comment recommended that the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements should protect communication regarding the overall security posture\nthat the health IT developer takes or makes the user take, including communications regarding a\nsystem with known and longstanding issues or bugs.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment and clarify that communications related to the\noverall security posture taken by a health IT developer would be within the subject area of\n“security of its health IT,” and thus would be protected communications covered by the\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements. We have finalized the scope of the\nprotected subject area “security of its health IT” in § 170.403(a)(1)(iii) as proposed.\n\n(D) User Experiences\nThe phrases “relevant information regarding users' experiences when using the health IT”\nand “user experience” are not defined in the Cures Act nor any other relevant statutory provisions.\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7470 to afford the term “user experience” its ordinary meaning. To qualify\nas a “user experience,” we proposed that the experience would have to have been one that is had\nby a user of health IT. However, beyond this, we did not propose to qualify the types of\nexperiences that would receive protection under the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements based on the “user experience” subject area. To illustrate the breadth of potential\nuser experiences that would be protected by the proposed Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements, we proposed that communications about “relevant information\nregarding users' experiences when using the health IT” would encompass, for example,\ncommunications and information about a person or organization’s experience acquiring,\nimplementing, using, or otherwise interacting with the health IT. We also proposed that this\nwould include experiences associated with the use of the health IT in the delivery of health care,\ntogether with administrative functions performed using the health IT. We proposed that user\nexperiences would also include the experiences associated with configuring and using the\ntechnology throughout implementation, training, and in practice. Further, we proposed that user\nexperiences would include patients’ and consumers’ user experiences with consumer apps, patient\nportals, and other consumer-facing technologies of the health IT developer. We clarified that a\n“relevant user experience” would include any aspect of the health IT user experience that could\npositively or negatively impact the effectiveness or performance of the health IT.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that the most relevant aspect of a user’s experience of a\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT system is whether that experience resulted in patient safety events and requested that\nONC specify patient safety events that arise from the use, misuse, or failure of health IT systems\nas “user experiences” that cannot be covered by gag orders.\n\n*Response.* As previously noted in our response to patient safety comments above, we\nreiterate that a user experience resulting in a patient safety event would be covered under the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements and that a communication about such an\nexperience would be protected, subject to other applicable laws. Further, communications about\n“adverse events, hazards, and other unsafe conditions to government agencies, health care\naccreditation organizations, and patient safety organizations” receive unqualified protection as\ndescribed in § 170.403(a)(2)(i). We noted in the Proposed Rule that the Patient Safety and Quality\nImprovement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) provides for privilege and confidentiality protections for\ninformation that meets the definition of patient safety work product (PSWP). This means that\nPSWP may only be disclosed as permitted by the PSQIA and its implementing regulations. We\nclarified that to the extent activities are conducted in accordance with the PSQIA, its\nimplementing regulation, and section 4005(c) of the Cures Act, no such activities shall be\nconstrued as constituting restrictions or prohibitions that contravene this Condition of\nCertification.\n\nWe believe that “user experience” was appropriately defined in the Proposed Rule and\nhave finalized the scope of the protected subject area “relevant information regarding users’\nexperiences when using its health IT” in § 170.403(a)(1)(iv) as proposed, with the clarification\nprovided above regarding patient safety events and to clarify that any communications regarding\nconsumer-facing technologies would need to be about certified consumer-facing technologies per\nour earlier clarification about the scope of this Condition of Certification being limited to certified\nhealth IT.\n\n\n\n\n(E) Manner in Which a User has Used Health IT\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7470 that protected communications regarding the “manner in\nwhich a user has used health IT” would encompass any information related to how the health IT\nhas been used. We also proposed that the terms used to describe the protected subject areas should\nbe construed broadly. We noted in the Proposed Rule that this subject area largely overlaps with\nthe matters covered under the “user experience” subject area but may include additional\nperspectives or details beyond those experienced by a user of health IT. We proposed that the\ntypes of information that would fall within this subject area include but are not limited to:\n information about a work-around implemented to overcome an issue in the health IT;\n customizations built on top of core health IT functionality;\n the specific conditions under which a user used the health IT, such as information about\nconstraints imposed on health IT functionality due to implementation decisions; and\n information about the ways in which health IT could not be used or did not function as was\nrepresented by the developer.\n\nWe did not receive comments on this specific aspect of the Proposed Rule, and we believe\nthe Proposed Rule appropriately outlined what would fall within the subject matter of the manner\nin which a user has used health IT. We have finalized the scope of the protected subject area\n“manner in which a user of the health IT has used such technology” in § 170.403(a)(1)(vi) as\nproposed, with the clarification that “used” refers to any uses of the certified health IT by the user\nand is not limited to uses that involve direct patient care.\n\n(F) Business Practices Related to Exchange\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7470 that the subject matter of “business practices of developers of\nhealth IT related to exchanging electronic health information” should be broadly construed to\n\n\n\n\ninclude developer policies and practices that facilitate the exchange of EHI and developer policies\nand practices that impact the ability of health IT to exchange health information. We further\nproposed that the exchange of EHI would encompass the appropriate and timely sharing of EHI.\n\nWe proposed that protected communications would include, but would not be limited to:\n the costs charged by a developer for products or services that support the exchange of EHI\n(e.g., interface costs, API licensing fees and royalties, maintenance and subscription fees,\ntransaction or usage-based costs for exchanging information);\n the timeframes and terms on which developers would or would not enable connections and\nfacilitate exchange with other technologies, individuals, or entities, including other health IT\ndevelopers, exchanges, and networks;\n the developer’s approach to participation in health information exchanges and/or networks;\n the developer’s licensing practices and terms as it relates to making available APIs and other\naspects of its technology that enable the development and deployment of interoperable\nproducts and services; and\n the developer’s approach to creating interfaces with third-party products or services,\nincluding whether connections are treated as “one off” customizations, or whether similar\ntypes of connections can be implemented at a reduced cost.\n\nImportantly, we further proposed in 84 FR 7470 that information regarding “business\npractices of developers of health IT related to exchanging electronic health information” would\ninclude information about switching costs imposed by a developer, as we are aware that the cost\nof switching health IT is a significant factor impacting health care providers adopting the most\nexchange-friendly health IT available.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that our proposed “business practices” is too broadly\n\n\n\n\ndefined and should relate exclusively to interoperability elements of certified health IT, rather\nthan to products and services that support exchange.\n\n*Response.* As discussed in the Proposed Rule, we believe the term “business practices of\ndevelopers of health IT related to exchanging electronic health information” should be broadly\nconstrued consistent with our interpretation of the Cures Act language regarding the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements, but limited to those business practices\nthat relate to the certified health IT as clarified previously in this Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification section. A wide variety of business practices could impact the exchange of EHI,\nincluding developer business strategies, pricing, and even fraudulent behavior. As such, we have\nfinalized in § 170.403(a)(1)(v) our proposal that such business practices include developer\npolicies and practices that impact or facilitate the exchange of EHI. They could also include costs\ncharged by a developer not only specifically for interoperability elements of the certified health\nIT, but also for any products or services that support the exchange of EHI through the certified\nhealth IT. We reiterate that business practices related to exchange could include timeframes and\nterms on which developers facilitate exchange; the developer’s approach to participating in health\ninformation exchanges and/or networks; the developer’s licensing practices and terms as related\nto APIs and other interoperable services; and the developer’s approach to creating interfaces with\nthird-party services. As proposed in 84 FR 7473, this Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirement will also apply to any communication concerning a Program requirement (e.g., a\nCondition or Maintenance of Certification requirement) related to the exchange of EHI or the\ninformation blocking provision.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters had concerns regarding communications about prices and\ncosts, with some commenters asserting that such communications should be protected and some\nothers asserting that developers should be able to restrict communications about prices and costs,\n\n\n\n\nincluding switching costs. Additionally, one commenter had concerns about protecting\ncommunications regarding timeframes and terms as well as workarounds and customizations. One\ncommenter also recommended that ONC seek guidance from the Antitrust Division of the FTC\nregarding economic impacts of regulating health IT developer terms, prices, and timeframes.\n\n*Response.* We continue to interpret costs, information regarding timeframes and terms,\nand information about health IT workarounds and customizations as protected communications\nunder the “Business Practices Related to Exchange” provision of this condition. We believe that\nthis type of information is frequently relied upon and necessary in order to optimize health IT for\nthe exchange of EHI. We emphasize that the costs charged by a developer for certified health IT\nor related services that support the exchange of EHI are significant factors that can impact the\nadoption of interoperable certified health IT and should be protected communications. For\nexample, pricing could include prohibitive costs that prevent or discourage customers from using\ncertified health IT to interact with competing technologies. Likewise, information regarding\ntimeframes and terms is the type of information considered and relied upon in the adoption of\ninteroperable certified health IT and is a protected communication. We have also finalized in §\n170.403(a)(1)(vi) that information about certified health IT workarounds and customizations\nrelates to important aspects of how a user has used certified health IT, including how the certified\nhealth IT can be used to achieve greater interoperability, and is a protected communication.\n\nIn response to the comments recommending that we seek guidance from the FTC, we note\nthat we are not regulating health IT developer terms, prices, and timeframes under this\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements, and therefore do not need to seek\nfurther guidance. Rather, the Communications Condition of Certification requirements would\nprotect communications about health IT developer costs, terms, and timeframes as described\nabove and ensure that such information could be shared. We have finalized the scope of the\n\n\n\n\nprotected subject area “business practices of developers of health IT related to exchanging\nelectronic health information” in § 170.403(a)(1)(v) as proposed.\niii. Meaning of “Prohibit or Restrict”\n\nThe terms “prohibit” and “restrict” are not defined in the Cures Act, nor in any other\nrelevant statutory provisions. We discussed in the Proposed Rule that communications can be\nprohibited or restricted through contractual terms or agreements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements\nor non-disparagement clauses) as well as through conduct, including punitive or retaliatory\nbusiness practices that are designed to create powerful disincentives to engaging in\ncommunications about developers or their health IT. Therefore, we proposed in 84 FR 7470 that\nthe Communications Condition of Certification requirements would not be limited to only formal\nprohibitions or restrictions (such as by means of contracts or agreements) and would encompass\nany conduct by a developer that would be likely to restrict a communication or class of\ncommunications protected by the Communications Condition of Certification requirements. We\nexplained that the conduct in question must have some nexus to the making of a protected\ncommunication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication.\n\n(A) Prohibitions or Restrictions Arising by Way of Contract\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the principal way that health IT developers can\ncontrol the disclosure of information about their health IT is through contractual prohibitions or\nrestrictions. We noted that there are different ways that contractual prohibitions or restrictions\narise. In some instances, a contractual prohibition or restriction will be expressed, and the precise\nnature and scope of the prohibition or restriction will be explicit in the contract or agreement.\n\nHowever, we also noted that a contract may also impose prohibitions or restrictions in less precise\nterms. We stated that a contract does not need to expressly prohibit or restrict a protected\ncommunication in order to have the effect of prohibiting or restricting that protected\n\n\n\n\ncommunication. The use of broad or vague language that obfuscates the types of communications\nthat can and cannot be made may be treated as a prohibition or restriction if it has the effect of\nrestricting legitimate communications about health IT.\n\nWe stated that restrictions and prohibitions found in contracts used by developers to sell or\nlicense their health IT can apply to customers directly and can require that the customer “flow-\ndown” obligations to the customer’s employees, contractors, and other individuals or entities that\nuse or work with the developer’s health IT. We proposed that such contract provisions would not\ncomply with the Communications Condition of Certification requirements and would be treated as\nprohibiting or restricting protected communications. We noted that prohibitions or restrictions on\ncommunications can also be found in separate nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) that developers\nrequire their customers—and in some instances the users of the health IT or third-party\ncontractors—to enter into in order to receive or access the health IT. We proposed that such\nagreements are covered by the Communications Condition of Certification requirements.\n\nWe did not receive comments on this specific aspect of the Proposed Rule and have\nfinalized our interpretation proposed in FR 7471 regarding prohibitions or restrictions arising by\nway of contract as stated above.\n\n(B) Prohibitions or Restrictions that Arise by Way of Conduct\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7471 that conduct that has the effect of prohibiting or restricting a\nprotected communication would be subject to the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements. We emphasized that the conduct in question must have some nexus to the making\nof a protected communication or an attempted or contemplated protected communication. As\nsuch, developer conduct that was alleged to be intimidating, or health IT performance that was\nperceived to be substandard, would not, in and of itself, implicate the Communications Condition\nof Certification requirements unless there was some nexus between the conduct or performance\n\n\n\n\nissue and the making of (or attempting or threatening to make) a protected communication.\n\nWe did not receive comments on this specific aspect of the Proposed Rule and have\nfinalized our interpretation proposed in 84 FR 7471 regarding prohibitions or restrictions arising\nby way of conduct as stated above.\niv. Communications with Unqualified Protection\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7472 a narrow class of communications—consisting of five\nspecific types of communications—that would receive unqualified protection from developer\nprohibitions or restrictions. With respect to communications with unqualified protection, a\ndeveloper would be prohibited from imposing any prohibition or restriction. We proposed that\nthis narrow class of communications warrants unqualified protection because of the strength of\nthe public policy interest being advanced by the class of the communication and/or the sensitivity\nwith which the identified recipient treats, and implements safeguards to protect the confidentiality\nand security of, the information received. We stated that a developer that imposes a prohibition or\nrestriction on a communication with unqualified protection would fail the first part of the two-part\ntest for allowable prohibitions or restrictions, and as such would contravene the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended adding language specifying the types of\nentities that can receive communications with unqualified protection, noting that such specificity\nwould help ensure that these communications go to the appropriate entities so that they can be\naddressed quickly. The commenter recommended that provisions around reporting to government\nentities should be limited to United States government entities.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe it is necessary to further specify the types of entities that can\nreceive communications with unqualified protection. We intend for this protection to cover a wide\nvariety of organizations, and further specifying the types of entities that can receive such\n\n\n\n\ncommunications, such as limiting communication to only United States government entities,\nwould unnecessarily limit the scope of this protection and could be counter to the public policy\ninterest to advance the ability of these communications to occur unencumbered. We have\nfinalized in § 170.403(a)(2)(i) our proposal to prohibit developers from imposing any prohibition\nor restriction on communications that fall into a narrow class of communications—consisting of\nthe five specific types of communications described below—that would receive unqualified\nprotection.\n\n(A) Disclosures Required by Law\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7472 that where a communication relates to subject areas\nenumerated in proposed § 170.403(a)(1) and there are Federal, State, or local laws that would\nrequire the disclosure of information related to health IT, developers must not prohibit or restrict\nin any way protected communications made in compliance with those laws. We noted that we\nexpect most health IT contracts would allow for, or not prohibit or restrict, any communication or\ndisclosure that is required by law, such as responding to a court or Congressional subpoena, or a\nvalid warrant presented by law enforcement. We further proposed that if required by law, a\npotential communicator should not have to delay any protected communication under the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements.\n\nWe did not receive comments on this aspect of the Proposed Rule and have finalized in §\n170.403(a)(2)(i)(A) our approach regarding disclosures required by law as proposed.\n\n(B) Communicating Information About Adverse Events, Hazards,\nand Other Unsafe Conditions to Government Agencies, Health Care\nAccreditation Organizations, and Patient Safety Organizations\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7472 that there is an overwhelming interest in ensuring that all\ncommunications about health IT that are necessary to identify patient safety risks, and to make\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT safer, not be encumbered by prohibitions or restrictions imposed by health IT developers\nthat may affect the extent or timeliness of communications. In addition to the public policy\ninterest in promoting uninhibited communications about health IT safety, we proposed that the\nrecognized communication channels for adverse events, hazards, and unsafe conditions provide\nprotections that help ensure that any disclosures made are appropriately handled and kept\nconfidential and secure. We proposed that the class of recipients to which the information can be\ncommunicated under this specific category of communications given unqualified protection\nshould provide health IT developers with comfort that there is little risk of such communications\nprejudicing the developer’s IP rights.\n\nWe sought comment on whether the unqualified protection afforded to communications\nmade to a patient safety organization about adverse events, hazards, and other unsafe conditions\nshould be limited. Specifically, we sought comment on whether the unqualified protection should\nbe limited by the nature of the patient safety organization to which a communication can be made,\nor the nature of the communication that can made.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters stated that ONC should not place any limits on the\nunqualified protection afforded to communications made to patient safety organizations about\nadverse events, hazards, and other unsafe conditions.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)(B) as proposed regarding the\nunqualified protection afforded to communications about adverse events, hazards, and other\nunsafe conditions that are made to government agencies, health care accreditation organizations,\nand patient safety organizations. Additionally, we placed no limits or qualifiers on such\ncommunications, including those communications made to patient safety organizations.\n\n(C) Communicating Information About Cybersecurity Threats and\nIncidents to Government Agencies\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7472 that if health IT developers were to impose prohibitions or\nrestrictions on the ability of any person or entity to communicate information about cybersecurity\nthreats and incidents to government agencies, such conduct would not comply with the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements.\n\nWe sought comment on whether it would be reasonable to permit health IT developers to\nimpose limited restrictions on communications about security issues to safeguard the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and security of EHI. In the Proposed Rule, we asked if, for example,\nhealth IT developers should be permitted to require that health IT users notify the developer about\nthe existence of a security vulnerability prior to, or simultaneously with, any communication\nabout the issue to a government agency.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that users should never be required to notify the\ndeveloper when reporting cybersecurity issues, as this would impose a burden on the user and a\npotential barrier to reporting. Other commenters recommended that developers should be allowed\nto require users to notify them simultaneously or prior to reporting such incidents, with one\ncomment noting that this would enable developers to better address and respond to security\nthreats prior to the knowledge of a threat becoming widespread. Some commenters recommended\nthat ONC make it a violation for developers to not share cybersecurity vulnerabilities with\nproviders, and that ONC work with DHS to mitigate issues around sharing such vulnerabilities.\n\nOne commenter recommended changing the wording regarding communicating cybersecurity and\nsecurity risks to include known vulnerabilities and health IT defects.\n\n*Response.* We strongly encourage users of health IT to notify developers as soon as\npossible when reporting security incidents and issues. However, it would not be appropriate to\nrequire this practice, which would impose an obligation on users of health IT that is outside the\nscope of this rule. It would also be outside the scope of this condition to implement additional\n\n\n\n\nrequirements for developers regarding the sharing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities with health care\nproviders. To be clear, we expect developers with Health IT Modules certified under the Program\nto share information about cybersecurity vulnerabilities with health care providers and other\naffected users as soon as feasible, so that these affected users can take appropriate steps to\nmitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities on the security of EHI and other PII in the users’\nsystems. Thus, we have finalized the Communications Condition of Certification requirements in\n§ 170.403(a)(2)(i)(C) as proposed. Developers must not place restrictions on communications\nreceiving unqualified protections. We also clarify that known vulnerabilities and health IT defects\nwould likely be considered types of “adverse events, hazards, and other unsafe conditions” that\nwould receive “unqualified protection,” and thus a developer would not be able to restrict a health\nIT user from communicating about such issues in communications receiving unqualified\nprotections under the Communications Condition of Certification requirements (see §\n170.403(a)(2)(i) as finalized). However, we note that in communications not receiving unqualified\nprotection under the Communications Condition of Certification requirements, a security\nvulnerability that is not already public knowledge would be considered a non-user-facing aspect\nof health IT, about which developers are permitted to restrict communications (see §\n170.403(a)(2)(ii)(B) as finalized). Last, we note that we will continue to work with our Federal\npartners to mitigate and address cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n\n(D) Communicating Information About Information Blocking and\nOther Unlawful Practices to a Government Agency\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7473 that the public benefit associated with the communication of\ninformation to government agencies on information blocking, or any other unlawful practice,\noutweighs any concerns developers might have about the disclosure of information about their\nhealth IT. We noted that reporting information blocking, as well as other unlawful practices, to a\n\n\n\n\ngovernment agency would not cause an undue threat to a health IT developer’s IP.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments regarding the lack of whistleblower protections\nin the Proposed Rule for individuals who report information blocking or other issues regarding\ncertified health IT. These comments discussed the need to provide for whistleblower type\nprotections for individuals who highlight information blocking practices, as well as to identify\nthem to the appropriate authorities so that the individual is not subject to retaliatory action by the\nactor identified by the whistleblower.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and agree that it is extremely important for\nindividuals to be able to report information blocking and violations of other Conditions of\nCertification without fear of retaliation. We note that the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements provide protections against retaliation and intimidation by developers\nwith respect to protected communications. We discussed in the Proposed Rule that the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements cover communications that are\nprohibited or restricted through contractual terms or agreements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements,\nnon-disparagement clauses) between the health IT developer, or offeror of health IT, and the\ncommunicator, as well as through conduct, including punitive or retaliatory business practices that\nare designed to create powerful disincentives to engaging in communications about developers or\ntheir health IT. We clarify, however, that merely filing a lawsuit against the communicator\nregarding the making of a communication would not be considered intimidating conduct in\nviolation of this Condition. Any such determination would necessarily be fact-specific, and the\nhealth IT developer’s lawsuit would have to be designed to intimidate a communicator in order to\nprevent or discourage that communicator from making a protected communication, rather than be\ndesigned to pursue a legitimate legal interest. We believe that the proposed broad interpretation of\n“prohibit” and “restrict” is appropriate given the intention of the Cures Act, which placed no\n\n\n\n\nlimitations on the protection of communications about the protected subject areas. We finalized\nthis interpretation of “prohibit” and “restrict” proposed in 84 FR 7470 and believe that the\ninterpretation would provide significant protections for whistleblowers from retaliatory actions.\n\nThus, retaliatory actions by a developer against a whistleblower would be in violation of this\nprovision. We also emphasize that conduct by a developer that may be perceived as intimidating\nor punitive would not implicate the Communications Condition of Certification requirements\nunless that conduct was specifically designed to influence the making of a protected\ncommunication. In other words, punitive actions must have a nexus to the making of a protected\ncommunication, such as retaliation for reporting of information blocking, in order to violate the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements in § 170.403(a)(1). Last, we refer\nreaders to the discussion of “complaints” under the information blocking section of this final rule,\nwhich details the confidentiality provided to information blocking complaints and complainants.\n\nWe have finalized the Communications Condition of Certification requirements in §\n170.403(a)(2)(i)(D) as proposed.\n\n(E) Communicating Information About a Health IT Developer’s\nFailure to Comply with a Condition of Certification or Other\nProgram Requirement\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7473 that the benefits to the public and to users of health IT of\ncommunicating information about a health IT developer’s failure to comply with a Condition of\nCertification requirement or other Program requirement (45 CFR part 170) justify prohibiting\ndevelopers of health IT from placing any restrictions on such protected communications. We\nexplained that information regarding the failure of certified health IT to meet any Condition of\nCertification requirement or other Program requirement is vital to the effective performance and\nintegrity of the Program. Moreover, the failure of a certified health IT to meet such requirements\n\n\n\n\ncould impact the performance of the certified health IT with respect to usability, safety, and\ninteroperability. We stated that it is important to enable unencumbered reporting of such\ninformation and that such reporting is essential to the transparency that section 4002 of the Cures\nAct seeks to ensure. While the current procedures for reporting issues with certified health IT\nencourage providers to contact developers in the first instance to address certification issues, we\nnoted that users of health IT should not hesitate to contact ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies\n(ONC-ACBs), or ONC itself, if the developer does not provide an appropriate response, or the\nmatter is of a nature that should be immediately reported to an ONC-ACB or to ONC.\n\nWe did not receive any comments on this aspect of the Proposed Rule. In consideration of\nthe above, we have finalized this provision in § 170.403(a)(2)(i)(E) as proposed.\nv. Permitted Prohibitions and Restrictions\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7473 that, except for communications with unqualified protection\n(§ 170.403(a)(2)(i)), health IT developers would be permitted to impose certain narrow\nprohibitions and restrictions on communications. Specifically, we proposed that, with the\nexception of communications with unqualified protection, developers would be permitted to\nprohibit or restrict the following communications, subject to certain conditions:\n Communications of their own employees;\n Disclosure of non-user-facing aspects of the software;\n Certain communications that would infringe the developer’s or another person’s IP rights;\n Publication of screenshots in narrow circumstances; and\n Communications of information that a person or entity knows only because of their\nparticipation in developer-led health IT development and testing.\n\nThe proposed Communications Condition of Certification requirements delineated the\n\n\n\n\ncircumstances under which these types of prohibitions and restrictions would be permitted,\nincluding certain associated conditions that developers would be required to meet. We\nemphasized that any prohibition or restriction not expressly permitted would violate the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements. Additionally, we proposed that it would\nbe the developer’s burden to demonstrate to the satisfaction of ONC that the developer met all\nassociated requirements. Further, as an additional safeguard, we proposed that where a developer\nsought to avail itself of one of the permitted types of prohibitions or restrictions, the developer\nmust ensure that potential communicators are clearly and explicitly notified about the information\nand material that can be communicated, and that which cannot. We proposed this would mean\nthat the language of health IT contracts must be precise and specific. We stressed that contractual\nprovisions or public statements that support a permitted prohibition or restriction on\ncommunication should be specific about the rights and obligations of the potential communicator.\n\nWe explained that contract terms that are vague and cannot be readily understood by a reasonable\nhealth IT customer would not benefit from the qualifications to this Condition of Certification\nrequirement as outlined in the Proposed Rule and below.\n\n(A) Developer Employees and Contractors\nWe recognized in the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7473 that health IT developer employees,\ntogether with the entities and individuals who are contracted by health IT developers to deliver\nproducts and/or services (such as consultants), may be exposed to highly sensitive, proprietary,\nand valuable information in the course of performing their duties. We also stated that we\nrecognize that an employer should have the ability to determine how and when the organization\ncommunicates information to the public, and that employees owe confidentiality obligations to\ntheir employers. We noted that this would similarly apply to contractors of a developer. We\nproposed in 84 FR 7473 that on this basis, developers would be permitted to impose prohibitions\n\n\n\n\nor restrictions on the communications of employees and contractors to the extent that those\ncommunications fall outside of the class of communications with unqualified protection as\ndiscussed above.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that this provision should be clarified and expanded to\ncover other third parties with whom the health IT developer shares its confidential information,\nincluding subcontractors, agents, auditors, suppliers, partners, co-sellers, and re-sellers, as well as\npotential relationships for which a contract has not yet been signed in case information is shared\nduring a pre-contract evaluation stage.\n\n*Response.* We reiterate that “developer employees and contractors” include health IT\ndeveloper employees, together with the entities and individuals who are contracted by health IT\ndevelopers to deliver health IT and/or services who may be exposed to highly sensitive,\nproprietary, and valuable information in the course of performing their duties. This functional\ndescription of employees and contractors could include subcontractors, agents, auditors, suppliers,\npartners, co-sellers, and re-sellers, depending on the specific relationship and circumstances. We\nhave finalized the proposed approach to describing employees and contractors in §\n170.403(a)(2)(ii)(A). We note that we did not expand this description to include “potential\nrelationships” because such an addition would make the description overly broad, and it is\nunlikely that individuals who are not yet under contract would be exposed to highly sensitive,\nproprietary, and valuable information.\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment that self-developers should not be permitted to\nplace restrictions on the communications of their employees who are using their certified health\nIT.\n\n*Response.* We agree that self-developers should not be allowed to restrict the\ncommunications of users of their certified health IT who are also employees or contractors. We\n\n\n\n\nhave revised § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(A) to clarify that the limited prohibitions developers may place\non their employees or contractors under the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements cannot be placed on users of a self-developer’s certified health IT who are also\nemployees or contractors of the self-developer. For example, a large health system with a self-\ndeveloped EHR cannot restrict a health care provider, who is employed by that health system and\nusing that EHR to provide services, from communicating about the EHR as a user based on the\nfact that the health care provider is also an employee of the health system. We note that the\nconcept of “self-developed” refers to a Complete EHR or Health IT Module designed, created, or\nmodified by an entity that assumed the total costs for testing and certification and that will be the\nprimary user of the health IT (76 FR 1300).\n\n(B) Non-User-Facing Aspects of Health IT\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7474 that the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements would permit health IT developers to impose prohibitions and restrictions on\ncommunications to the extent necessary to ensure that communications do not disclose “non-user-\nfacing aspects of health IT.” We noted that, like all permitted prohibitions, such prohibitions and\nrestrictions could only be put in place by developers if there is not an unqualified protection that\napplies. We proposed in 84 FR 7474 that a “non-user-facing aspect of health IT,” for the purpose\nof this Condition of Certification, was an aspect of health IT that is not a “user-facing aspect of\nhealth IT.” We stated that “user-facing aspects of health IT” would include the design concepts\nand functionality that is readily ascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen\ndisplay. We stated that they did not include those parts of the health IT that are not exposed to\npersons running, using, or observing the operation of the health IT and that are not readily\nascertainable from the health IT’s user interface and screen display, all of which would be\nconsidered “non-user-facing” concepts. We proposed in 84 FR 7474 that “non-user-facing aspects\n\n\n\n\nof health IT” would include source and object code, software documentation, design\nspecifications, flowcharts, and file and data formats. We welcomed comments on whether these\nand other aspects of health IT should or should not be treated as user-facing.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we noted that the terminology of “non-user-facing aspects of health\nIT” is not intended to afford only health IT users with specific protections against developer\nprohibitions or restrictions on communications and is agnostic as to the identity of the\ncommunicator.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern regarding the broad scope of “user-\nfacing” and, by extension, the scope of “non-user-facing.” One commenter asked for clarification\nregarding the definition of “software documentation” with regards to non-user-facing aspects of\nhealth IT and suggested that it applies to documentation that is for back-end components, not\ndocuments for normal-end use. Additionally, a couple of comments stated that administrative\nfunctions should not be considered user-facing, including one comment that the relevant users for\nthe purpose of the Communications Condition of Certification requirements are “end” users, thus\nthe non-user-facing provision should apply only to “non-end-user-facing” aspects of health IT.\n\nSome commenters emphasized that administrative portions of health IT contain more insight into\nhealth IT systems and that administrative functions affect a limited number of users and are not\nthe types of communications or subject matters contemplated by the Cures Act. One commenter\nstated that algorithms should be considered non-user-facing. Another commenter stated that ONC\nshould clarify the status of diagrams and flowcharts.\n\n*Response.* We do not see a necessary or appreciable distinction between “users” and “end\nusers,” as we have focused on the aspects of the health IT that are and are not subject to protected\ncommunications under this Condition of Certification. We also believe that there could be\nunintended consequences with the term “end user,” such as limiting certain users not specified\n\n\n\n\nunder the “permitted prohibitions and restrictions” (e.g., developer employees and contractors)\nfrom making protected communications. Therefore, we believe \"non-user-facing\" best reflects the\nscope of the communications about health IT we seek to capture with these terms.\n\nWe reiterate that “non-user-facing aspects of health IT” comprise those aspects of the\nhealth IT that are not readily apparent to someone interacting with the health IT as a user of the\nhealth IT, including source and object code, certain software documentation, design\nspecifications, flowcharts, and file and data formats. We clarify that “non-user-facing aspects of\nhealth IT” would also include underlying software that is utilized by the health IT in the\nbackground and not directly by a user of the health IT. For example, the programming\ninstructions for proprietary APIs would be considered non-user-facing because they are not\nreadily apparent to the individual users of the health IT. In addition, underlying database software\nthat connects to health IT and is used to store data would be considered a non-user-facing aspect\nof health IT because it serves data to the health IT, not directly to a user.\n\nWe further clarify that algorithms would be considered “non-user-facing aspects of health\nIT” as they are not readily apparent to persons using health IT for the purpose for which it was\npurchased or obtained. Thus, communications regarding algorithms (e.g., mathematical methods\nand logic) could be restricted or prohibited, while communications regarding the output of the\nalgorithm and how it is displayed in a health IT system could not be restricted as “non-user-facing\naspects of health IT.” Similarly, we also clarify that certain “software documentation” that would\nbe considered to be a non-user-facing aspect of health IT would include documentation for back-\nend components, again because it is not readily apparent to persons using health IT.\n\nWhether or not a communication would be considered a “non-user-facing aspects of\nhealth IT” would be based on whether the communication involved aspects of health IT that\nwould be evident to anyone running, using, or observing the operation of the health IT for the\n\n\n\n\npurpose for which it was purchased or obtained. With respect to administrative functions, where\nthe communication at issue relates to aspects of the health IT that are not observable by users of\nthe health IT, it would be considered “non-user-facing” for the purpose of this Condition of\nCertification requirement. For example, a communication regarding an input process delay\nexperienced by an administrator of health IT that was caused by the underlying database software\ncould be restricted if the communication discussed the underlying database software, which\nwould be considered a non-user-facing aspect of the health IT. However, if the communication\ndiscussed the user screens and the delay experienced by the administrator, which would be\nconsidered user-facing aspects of health IT, it could not be restricted. Similarly, as long as\ndiagrams or flowcharts do not include aspects of the health IT that are observable by users of the\nhealth IT, as described above, they would be considered communications about non-user-facing\naspects of health IT.\n\nWe have finalized in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(B) our proposed approach to the scope of “non-\nuser-facing aspects of health IT” with the clarification provided above regarding scope.\n\n(C) Intellectual Property\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7474 that the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements are not intended to operate as a de facto license for health IT users and others to act\nin a way that might infringe the legitimate IP rights of health IT developers or other persons.\n\nIndeed, we proposed in 84 FR 7474 that health IT developers are permitted to prohibit or restrict\ncertain communications that would infringe their IP rights so long as the communication in\nquestion is not a communication with unqualified protection. We proposed in 84 FR 7474 that any\nprohibition or restriction imposed by a developer must be no broader than legally permissible and\nreasonably necessary to protect the developer’s legitimate IP interests. We also proposed in 84 FR\n7474 that health IT developers are not permitted to prohibit or restrict, or purport to prohibit or\n\n\n\n\nrestrict, communications that would be a “fair use” of any copyright work comprised in the\ndeveloper’s health IT.86\n“Fair use” is a legal doctrine that allows for the unlicensed use of\ncopyright material in certain circumstances, which could include circumstances involving\ncriticism, commentary, news reporting, and research.87\nComments. One commenter stated that fair use should not override other IP protections\nand stressed that relying on fair use could lead to uncertainty because it is determined on a case-\nby-case basis. Another commenter stated that because the fair use doctrine can be difficult to\nimplement and can lead to uncertain results, ONC should expand the list of communications that\nwould be explicitly protected as fair use to include news reporting, criticism, parody, and\ncommunications for educational purposes.\n\n*Response.* We disagree with commenters and believe that relying on the “fair use”\ndoctrine for determining when a screenshot or other communication cannot be restricted should\nbe allowed under the Communications Condition of Certification requirements. This doctrine\npresents a framework of analysis that is well-developed in case law and thus can be interpreted\nand applied consistently, even when materials are not formally copyrighted. Accordingly, we are\nretaining the concept of “fair use” in the final provision in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(C). Developers and\nONC will apply a fair use test to copyrighted materials and, by analogy, to materials that could be\ncopyrighted, to determine whether developers may prohibit a communication that would infringe\non IP rights.\n\nThe Communication Condition of Certification requirements relate only to protected\ncommunications, thus developers can place restrictions on communications about subject matters\n86\nSee 17 U.S.C. 107 (setting forth the four factors required to evaluate a question of fair use under the statutory\nframework).\n\n87\nSee https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html for more information on fair use.\n\n\n\n\noutside of the protected communications categories without implicating the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements. Also, as discussed earlier regarding developer employees\nand contractors in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(A), developers may restrict communications by their\nemployees, contractors, and consultants without implicating the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements, provided they do not restrict communications with unqualified\nprotections. Further, as described earlier regarding non-user-facing aspects of certified health IT\nin § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(B), developers may restrict communications that disclose non-user-facing\naspects of the developer’s certified health IT, provided they do not restrict communications with\nunqualified protections. We clarified in that section that screenshots or videos depicting source\ncode would be considered communications of non-user-facing aspects of health IT and could be\nrestricted under the Communications Condition of Certification requirements as long as they did\nnot receive unqualified protection. We also clarify that this Condition does not prohibit health IT\ndevelopers from enforcing their IP rights and that a lawsuit filed by a health IT developer in\nresponse to a protected communication regarding infringement of IP rights would not\nautomatically be considered intimidation or retaliation in violation of this Condition.\n\nAs discussed later in the pre-market testing and development section in §\n170.403(a)(2)(ii)(E), developers can place restrictions on communications related to pre-market\nhealth IT development and testing activities, which could include IP protections, provided they do\nnot restrict communications with unqualified protections. Combined, these avenues allow for\nprotecting IP in ways that would not implicate the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements, thereby allowing developers to take a number of actions to protect and safeguard IP\nin their certified health IT.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarity regarding how the proposed protections\nfor IP would work. One commenter stated that the rule must allow developers to protect\n\n\n\n\nlegitimate IP interests and asked for clarity on how ONC would determine whether a developer’s\nrestriction on the communication of a screenshot was an allowable protection of trade secrets or\nan impermissible restriction of protected communications. Several other commenters, who\ngenerally supported the Communications Condition of Certification requirements, requested\nclarification regarding how a prohibition on communications that is designed to protect IP can be\napplied. Some commenters requested examples of the types of communications that can be\nrestricted on the basis of IP and clarification of the standard ONC will use to determine what\nprohibitions are permissible.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized an approach in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(C) that allows\ndevelopers to prohibit or restrict communications that involve the use or disclosure of\nintellectual property existing in the developer’s health IT (including third-party intellectual\nproperty), provided that any prohibition or restriction imposed by a developer must be no\nbroader than necessary to protect the developer’s legitimate intellectual property interests and\nconsistent with all other requirements under the “permitted prohibitions and restrictions” (§\n170.403(a)(2)(ii)) of this section. As discussed above, a restriction or prohibition would be\ndeemed broader than necessary and inconsistent with the “permitted prohibitions and\nrestrictions” (§ 170.403(a)(2)(ii)) if it would restrict or preclude a public display of a portion\nof a work subject to copyright protection (without regard to whether the copyright is\nregistered) that would reasonably constitute a “fair use” of that work.\n\nExamples of the types of communications that could be restricted under the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements might include a blog post describing a\ncustomization of a developer’s health IT that includes the source code of the developer’s health IT\nor a written review of an analytical feature of the developer’s health IT that reveals the algorithms\nused. However, as mentioned above, the restriction must be no broader than necessary to protect\n\n\n\n\nthe developer’s legitimate IP interests, thus only the infringing portions of the communications\ncould be restricted.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that a health IT developer must demonstrate\nthat a communication was specifically designed to copy or steal a developer’s IP in order for the\ndeveloper to be allowed to prohibit the communication as an infringement on their IP rights.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment, but decline to require that a developer\ndemonstrate that a communication was designed to copy or steal IP in order for the developer to\nrestrict the communication as one that would infringe on IP rights. We believe that the revised\napproach discussed above provides appropriate balance between protecting IP rights and enabling\nprotected communications and do not believe that an “intent” element would be necessary. We\nhave finalized the proposals regarding IP in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(C), as amended above.\n\n(D) Faithful Reproductions of Health IT Screenshots\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7475 that health IT developers generally would not be permitted to\nprohibit or restrict communications that disclose screenshots of the developer’s health IT. We\nproposed that the reproduction of screenshots in connection with the making of a communication\nprotected by this Condition of Certification would ordinarily represent a “fair use” of any\ncopyright subsisting in the screen display, and developers should not impose prohibitions or\nrestrictions that would limit that fair use. Notwithstanding this, we proposed that health IT\ndevelopers would be allowed to place certain restrictions of the disclosure of screenshots as\nspecified in proposed § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D).\n\nWith respect to the limited allowable restrictions on screenshots, we proposed in 84 FR\n7475 that developers would be permitted to prevent communicators from altering screenshots,\nother than to annotate the screenshot or to resize it for the purpose of publication. We also\nproposed that health IT developers could impose restrictions on the disclosure of a screenshot on\n\n\n\n\nthe basis that it would infringe third-party IP rights (on their behalf or as required by license).\n\nHowever, to take advantage of this exception, we proposed in 84 FR 7475 that the developer\nwould need to first put all potential communicators on sufficient written notice of those parts of\nthe screen display that contain IP and cannot be communicated, and would still need to allow\ncommunicators to communicate redacted versions of screenshots that do not reproduce those\nparts. Finally, we proposed in 84 FR 7475 that it would be reasonable for developers to impose\nrestrictions on the communication of screenshots that contain PHI, provided that developers\npermit the communication of screenshots that have been redacted to conceal PHI, or where the\nrelevant individual’s consent or authorization had been obtained.\n\nWe welcomed comments on whether an appropriate balance had been struck between\nprotecting legitimate IP rights of developers and ensuring that health IT customers, users,\nresearchers, and other stakeholders who use and work with health IT can openly discuss and share\ntheir experiences and other relevant information about the performance of health IT.\n\n*Comments.* A large number of commenters, particularly health care providers, supported\nour proposals regarding the communication of screenshots, with several stressing how helpful\nscreenshots are when communicating usability and safety issues with health IT. One commenter\nnoted that communication of screenshots can help different health care systems understand\nwhether a proposed implementation of an EHR has introduced safety-related challenges at other\nlocations, or help identify solutions to common problems, such as usability challenges. One other\ncommenter stated that there is nothing novel displayed in health IT screenshots that would need to\nbe protected.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the many positive comments on our proposals regarding\nscreenshots.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters stated that the scope of protected communications as proposed\n\n\n\n\nshould exclude disclosure of the health IT itself, such as through screenshots. The commenter\nstressed that the Cures Act required that health IT developers not restrict communications about\nthe certified health IT with respect to specific topic areas, while the Proposed Rule expands that\nrestriction to include communication of the health IT itself. One commenter noted that the Cures\nAct does not mention screenshots and they should not be included in the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements.\n\n*Response.* The Cures Act amended title XXX of the PHSA to establish this condition of\ncertification, which applies to “health information technology.” Title XXX of the PHSA was\npreviously added by the HITECH Act, which included the definition of “health information\ntechnology.” Section 3000(5) of the PHSA defines health information technology to mean\nhardware, software, integrated technologies or related licenses, IP, upgrades, or packaged\nsolutions sold as services that are designed for or support the use by health care entities or patients\nfor the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or exchange of health information. We emphasize\nboth that this definition includes IP associated with the health information technology and that it\napplies to this condition of certification as this condition references communications regarding\nhealth information technology. We have also adopted this definition in § 170.102.\n\nWe disagree with the commenters’ interpretation of the statutory provision. The statutory\nprovision focuses on “communications” regarding enumerated aspects of the health IT.\n\nCommunications are not defined nor limited in the Cures Act, and we proposed to broadly define\nthem. Verbal, written, and visual, as well other types of communications, are all covered under\nthe Cures Act. A screenshot is a copy/picture of the user interface of the health IT, or a “visual\ncommunication” that is protected under this condition of certification. We have specifically\ndefined “communication” for this section in § 170.403(c) to mean any communication,\nirrespective of the form or medium. The term includes visual communications, such as\n\n\n\n\nscreenshots and video.\n\nAs we emphasized in the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7475, the sharing of screenshots (with\naccompanying annotation and/or explanatory prose) is often a critical form of communication of\nissues with health IT related to—for example—usability, user experience, interoperability,\nsecurity, or the way the technology is used. We believe screenshots are uniquely helpful as a form\nof visual communication that can non-verbally illustrate the “user’s experiences when using the\nhealth information technology” and the “manner in which a user of the health information\ntechnology has used such technology” as they relate intrinsically to both subject areas and capture\nthose user experiences immediately and directly. Further, enabling screenshot sharing can allow\nfor clearer, more immediate, and more precise communication on these pertinent issues,\npotentially helping a health system avoid costly, or even deadly, complications when\nimplementing health IT. It is also our understanding that screenshots are often the only recourse a\nuser in a network enterprise system has for capturing, documenting, and explaining their\nconcerns. We clarify, however, that the sharing of a screenshot alone would not be considered a\nprotected communication as it would need to be accompanied by an explanation of the issues or\naspects of the health IT that the screenshot is meant to communicate or illustrate.\n\nConsidering the value of communicating significant issues regarding health IT through\nscreenshots, we have finalized our proposal to include screenshots as a protected communications\nunder the Cures Act. However, as discussed in responses to other comments below, we have\nrevised our final policy in multiple ways.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that screenshots should be defined broadly to\ninclude video and other media that can be helpful in demonstrating challenges with EHRs.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the recommendation that protections afforded to screenshots\nshould extend to video. We clarify that, like screenshots, video is considered a form of visual\n\n\n\n\ncommunication. A video of a computer screen while a software program is in operation would\ncapture the user experience of interacting with that program and essentially would show a number\nof screenshots from that program in rapid succession. We emphasize that video, similarly to\nindividual screenshots, is a critical form of communication of issues with the health IT, including\nissues related to usability, user experience, interoperability, security, or the way the technology is\nused.\n\nAs with screenshots, video is particularly useful in communicating a user’s experience\nwith health IT and the manner in which the user has used health IT. This is especially the case\nwhen issues of a temporal nature are involved. For example, video would be essential for\nillustrating a latency issue experienced during drug ordering that could not be communicated\nthrough screenshots or other forms of communication. Video also could be critical to\ndemonstrating an issue with a clinical decision support alert that is designed to appropriately and\ntimely notify the provider of a patient matter but fails to do so.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern regarding how a developer’s IP may\nbe impacted by the proposed Communications Condition of Certification requirements. Several\ncommenters stated that the Proposed Rule goes beyond protecting communications for the\npurposes of patient safety and system improvement and would enable or require inappropriate\nsharing and disclosure of IP, potentially creating security risks, increased IP theft, and harming\ninnovation and the marketplace for health IT. Several commenters stated that trade secrets, patent\nprotections, and protections for confidential and proprietary information were not addressed or\nconsidered appropriately in the Proposed Rule, and that as a result it would be possible for bad\nactors to create pirated health IT based on the disclosure of screenshots and similar\ncommunications. Commenters stated that developers of health IT have successfully used licensing\nand nondisclosure agreements that apply to user-facing aspects of the technology to maintain the\n\n\n\n\ntrade secret status of their health IT and that the Proposed Rule would impact their ability to do so\nand remain competitive in the market.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments regarding how a developer’s IP may be impacted\nby the Communications Condition of Certification requirements. As discussed earlier in this\nsection, participation in the Program is voluntary; and developers have the option to agree to the\nterms we have offered or to choose not to participate in the Program. However, we recognize the\nneed to properly balance the protection of a developer’s IP with the need to advance visual\ncommunications (e.g., screenshot and video communications) under the Communications\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements, which we believe is critical to\naddressing—among other things—the usability, interoperability, and security of health IT. As\ndiscussed throughout this section and in section (C) above, we believe that we have properly\nconsidered and addressed health IT developers’ IP rights in this final rule in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(C)\nby amending the proposed regulation as described above.\n\nWe emphasize that the communication of screenshots is essential to protect public health\nand safety and that our final policies take a measured approach to responding to and addressing a\nreal and substantial threat to public health and safety. The communication of screenshots enables\nproviders, researchers, and others to identify safety concerns, share their experiences with the\nhealth IT, learn from the problems, and then repair dangers that could otherwise cause serious\nharm to patients. Our position is informed both by years of experience regulating health IT and\noverwhelming research and academia, which is discussed below.\n\nFor instance, a study published in 2018 was performed to better characterize accessibility\nto EHRs among informatics professionals in various roles, settings, and organizations across the\n\n\n\n\nUnited States and internationally.88\nTo quantify the limitations on EHR access and publication\nrights, the researchers conducted a survey of informatics professionals from a broad spectrum of\nroles including practicing clinicians, researchers, administrators, and members of industry. The\nresults were analyzed and levels of EHR access were stratified by role, organizational affiliation,\ngeographic region, EHR type, and restrictions with regard to publishing results of usability\ntesting, including screenshots. Among faculty members and researchers, 72 percent could access\nthe EHR for usability and/or research purposes, but, of those, fewer than 1 in 3 could freely\npublish screenshots with results of usability testing and half could not publish such data at all.\n\nAcross users from all roles, only 21 percent reported the ability to publish screenshots freely\nwithout restrictions.89\nThe study explained that the patient safety implications of EHR publication censorship\nand restricted EHR access are multiple. First, limiting institutions from sharing usability research\nfindings can prevent the correction of known problems. Second, without public dissemination,\npoor design practices will propagate to future iterations of existing vendor systems. Finally,\nresearch efforts are directed away from real-world usability problems at a time when EHR\nsystems have become widely deployed and when an urgency exists to accelerate usability testing.\n\nThe study referenced the 2011 Institute of Medicine report (as discussed in the Proposed Rule and\nin additional detail below), which identified contractual restrictions as a barrier to knowledge\nregarding patient safety risks related to health IT. 90\nThe study emphasized that the result of this level of censorship is that a vast majority of\nscientists researching EHR usability are either prevented from publishing screenshots altogether\n88Khairat, S, et al. 2018 Assessing the Status Quo of EHR Accessibility, Usability, and Knowledge Dissemination.\neGEMs (Generating Evidence & Methods to improve patient outcomes), pp. 1–11,\nhttps://doi.org/10.5334/egems.228.\n\n89 Id. at 1.\n\n90 Id. at 2.\n\n\n\n\nor must first obtain vendor permission, thus impeding the free dialogue necessary in communities\nof investigation.91\nThe study argued that: (1) lack of EHR access makes many critical EHR\nusability research activities impossible to conduct, and (2) publication censorship, especially\nregarding screenshots, means that even those usability studies which can be conducted may not\nhave the impact they otherwise would. As a consequence, innovation can be stifled. As such, one\nof the recommendations made by the researchers was that there should be a mandate that\nscreenshots and images from EHR systems be freely publishable without restrictions from copy-\nright or trade secret constraints.92\nIn the report by the Institute of Medicine that was noted above, entitled Health IT and\nPatient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care,93\nthe Committee on Patient Safety and\nHealth Information Technology (Committee) explained that a significant impediment to gathering\nsafety data is contractual barriers (e.g., nondisclosure, confidentiality clauses) that can prevent\nusers from sharing information about health IT–related adverse events. They further explained\nthat such barriers limit users’ abilities to share knowledge of risk-prone user interfaces, for\ninstance through screenshots and descriptions of potentially unsafe processes. In addition, some\nvendors include language in their sales contracts and escape responsibility for errors or defects in\ntheir software (i.e., “hold-harmless clauses”). The Committee concluded that these types of\ncontractual restrictions limit transparency, which significantly contributes to the gaps in\nknowledge of health IT–related patient safety risks. Further, these barriers to generating evidence\npose unacceptable risks to safety.94\nBased on these findings, the committee recommended that the\nSecretary of HHS should ensure insofar as possible that health IT vendors support the free\n91 Id. at 7.\n\n92 Id. at 8.\n\n93 Institute of Medicine 2012.

Washington,\nDC: The National Academies Press, https://doi.org/10.17226/13269.\n\n94 Id. at 3.\n\n\n\n\nexchange of information about health IT experiences and issues and not prohibit sharing of such\ninformation, including details (e.g., screenshots) relating to patient safety.95\nRecently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) funded Brigham and Women’s\nHospital Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice to conduct an exploration of\ncomputerized prescriber order entry (CPOE)-related potential for errors in prescribing,\nparticularly as these relate to drug name displays, and ordering and workflow design issues. The\nproject investigated ways to better identify, understand, and prevent electronic ordering errors in\nthe future.96\nHowever, the researchers noted that one large vendor would not grant permissions to\nshare requested screenshots necessary for the study. This refusal ran counter to both the FDA’s\ntask order initial precondition as well as multiple high-level panels’ health IT safety\nrecommendations. The FDA emphasized that it is hard to justify from a safety viewpoint why\nsuch permission was withheld, despite the vendors’ proprietary concerns. FDA explained that\nidentifying, preventing, and learning from errors and improving prescribing safety should be a\npriority and should take precedence over commercial considerations (and to the extent correctable\nproblems can be identified, likely would result in an improved commercial CPOE product). In\ncases where the FDA sought to illustrate problems in the system, they drew generic screenshots to\nillustrate the issue in question.97\nAmong their recommendations, the FDA recommended that vendors be required to share\nscreenshots and error reports. The FDA emphasized that vendors should be required to permit the\nsharing of screenshots and information with the FDA and other institutions regarding other CPOE\nsystem issues of concern or that pose risk for errors. They stressed that the practice of prohibiting\n95 Id. at 7.\n\n96 U.S. Food & Drug Admin., UCM477419, Computerized Prescriber Order Entry Medication Safety: Uncovering\nand Learning from Issues and Errors,\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/MedicationErrors/UCM477419.pdf.\n\n97 Id. at 44.\n\n\n\n\nsuch sharing via copyright must be eliminated. Further, the FDA recommended that vendors\nshould be required to disclose errors reported to them or errors identified in their products,\nanalogous to the requirement that drug manufacturers report significant adverse drug effects.98\nOne of the co-authors of the FDA study recently wrote a law review article that discussed\nthe significance of screenshots.99\nThe author noted that the results of the FDA study were\nremarkable and remarkably distressing, as they identified and took screenshots of over fifty\ndifferent dangers in the health IT. He expressed frustration that it took up to two years of\nadditional discussions with the vendors to get permission to share the screenshots publicly, and\nthat even after these extended discussions, one vendor—“with more than a lion’s share of the\nmarket”—prevented the study from displaying the screenshots, some of which were clearly\ndangerous or deadly. He explained that they had worked around that limitation by substituting the\none vendor’s screens with parallel screens taken from Harvard’s homegrown, but by then\nsuperannuated, EHR. The author emphasized that those images and screenshots illustrated over\nfifty EHR risks caused by dangerous and confusing EHR interfaces. The author also emphasized\nthat the study could have been even more helpful in identifying these risks if the FDA had been\nable to present the findings when first available, rather than haggle for a year or two, and if the\nstudy was able to include all of the full images from each system they studied.100\nComments. A commenter recommended that ONC draw a distinction around purpose of\nuse in relation to the fair use of screenshots and require that the discloser of a screenshot be\nresponsible for ensuring the appropriateness of that purpose.\n\n*Response.* As discussed under section (C) above we have retained the concept of “fair use”\n\n98 Id. at 52.\n\n99 Ross Koppel, Uses of the Legal System That Attenuate Patient Safety, 68 DePaul L.

As discussed throughout this section, we have placed\ncertain restrictions on the sharing of screenshots responsive to the commenter.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter urged ONC to revise the proposed approach to screenshots by\nadopting a process that would allow developers to review and approve screenshots for publication\nfor specific purposes, such as communications about safety and usability.\n\n*Response.* A pre-approval process could create potential or perceived barriers to\ncommunications and thus could discourage or delay the making of protected communications that\nare vital to patient safety or other important issues regarding certified health IT. For example, a\nuser might be less willing to go through the process, the time the process takes could undermine\nthe conveyance of the communications, and the objections raised during the process may not be\nvalid or amenable to all parties.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters had concerns regarding the volume of screenshots that\ncould be shared under our proposal and potential harms that could occur. One commenter\nemphasized that sharing of screenshots could disclose information about how health IT works,\nincluding algorithms and workflows, and enable creation of duplicate software and theft of\nvaluable IP. One commenter suggested that if a user of health IT published hundreds of\nscreenshots of the health IT, a bad actor could theoretically deduce trade secrets based on the\nscreenshots. Several additional commenters were also concerned that the Proposed Rule could\nallow communication of an unlimited number of screenshots of certified health IT, and one\ncommenter suggested revising the proposed approach to include limiting sharing of screenshots to\na reasonable number, such as seven.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate those comments expressing concerns regarding the volume of\nscreenshots that could be shared and the potential negative consequences of allowing screenshots\n\n\n\n\nto be shared. In the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7475, we proposed to allow developers to place\nlimited restrictions on the sharing of screenshots. We stressed in the Proposed Rule that our goal\nwith our proposals concerning screenshots was to enable communications that will address\nmatters such as patient safety, system security vulnerabilities, health IT performance, and\nusability. Our intent was not to prevent developers from restricting the communication of\nscreenshots for purposes outside the scope of the protected communications detailed in the Cures\nAct. Additionally, we believe that modern software design best practices uncouple screen design\nfrom underlying algorithms, and that limited use of screenshots for safety would not allow reverse\nengineering of large parts of the underlying code. However, we further emphasize that it was\nnever our intention that screenshots (or other visual communications such as video) depicting\nsource or object codes would be protected communications (see the non-user-facing aspects\nprovision of this Condition of Certification), so long as such communications are not\ncommunications with unqualified protection.\n\nWe reviewed comments that suggested establishing a set numerical limit for the sharing of\nscreenshots. However, we have not finalized a requirement in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D) with a fixed\nnumerical limit because there is no non-arbitrary way to determine what the “right” or\n“appropriate” number is in a one-size-fits-all way. That is because the number of screenshots or\namount of video that would be needed to communicate about the health IT could vary, from one\nsituation to the next, based on the specific issue and circumstances. For instance, an issue with\nhealth IT functionality regarding a particular process that involves the user viewing and making\nselections on several different screens may necessitate images of all of the screens involved in\norder to communicate the issue. However, an issue regarding how one value is being displayed in\na particular context (e.g., a medication name being truncated) may only necessitate one screenshot\nin order to communicate the issue. Thus, we believe the best approach is to adopt a qualitative\n\n\n\n\nstandard that is designed to be sufficiently flexible for the wide range of health IT issues that may\narise and the varying visual communications that need to be communicated to demonstrate or\ndisplay the issue.\n\nWe have finalized provisions in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D)(2) and (3) that allow health IT\ndevelopers to require persons who communicate screenshots to limit the sharing of screenshots to\nonly the relevant number of screenshots and amount of video that are needed to communicate\nabout the health IT regarding one or more of the six subject areas identified in the Cures Act and\ndetailed in § 170.403(a)(1). Allowing developers to limit the sharing of screenshots to only the\nrelevant number needed to communicate about the health IT – regarding one or more of those six\nsubject areas – places a limitation on the number of screenshots allowed to be shared under the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements and requires that the screenshots are\nrelated to, and thus necessary in illustrating, the protected communication being made. In practice,\nthis would mean that if a particular safety issue in the health IT could be communicated using\nthree screenshots, the communicator should not share additional screenshots that are irrelevant or\nonly potentially relevant to communicate the safety issue with the health IT. If the communication\nincluded additional screenshots that were not necessary to visually communicate about the\nparticular safety issue with the health IT that falls within the usability category, the health IT\ndeveloper would have grounds to seek redress.\n\nAs with screenshots, we wish to be sensitive to concerns regarding protecting IP in health\nIT and allow developers to appropriately limit video communication in order to protect against\nharms that could occur due to unlimited sharing. Similar to screenshots, the amount of video that\nmay be necessary to make a protected communication about health IT could vary, depending on\nthe nature of the issue or aspect of the health IT being addressed. For example, a video meant to\ncommunicate a delay in order entry would need to be long enough to communicate the\n\n\n\n\nsignificance of the delay, but would not need to include video of the log-in process or other\nunrelated functionality of the health IT. We have finalized a provision in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D)(3)\nthat allows health IT developers to place certain limitations on the communication of video.\n\nUnder this provision, a health IT developer may require persons who communicate video to limit\nthe sharing of video to: (1) the relevant amount of video needed to communicate about the health\nIT regarding one or more of the subject areas identified in the Cures Act and detailed in §\n170.403(a)(1); and (2) only videos that address temporal matters that the user reasonably believes\ncannot be communicated through screenshots or other forms of communications.\n\nIn sum, any disclosure must be limited to the relevant number of screenshots or amount of\nvideo that is necessary to convey the matter that falls within one of the six subject areas, with\nvideo only being used to convey temporal matters that cannot be communicated through\nscreenshots or other forms of communication. We believe these additional limitations on the\ncommunication of screenshots and video will further bolster protections for developer IP, while\nstill allowing necessary and effective communication about health IT issues within the six subject\nareas.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters stated that there should be a way to protect against\ndoctored screenshots.\n\n*Response.* As proposed, communicators of screenshots must not alter the screenshots (or\nvideo), except to annotate the screenshots or resize the screenshots (§ 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D)(1)).\n\nThese restrictions similarly apply to video as well (§ 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D)(1)). We further note\nthat, despite a lack of comments, on further reflection, we have elected to not finalize proposed\nlimitations to allow developers to impose restrictions on the communication of screenshots that\ncontain PHI. We have made this determination because we believe that most of the individuals or\nentities communicating the screenshots would be bound by other laws, including the HIPAA\n\n\n\n\nRules and State privacy laws, which would be applicable to the PHI at issue. Therefore, we do not\nbelieve it is necessary to provide for developers policing the release of such data in the form of\nscreenshots in this Condition of Certification.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters discussed the infeasibility of the proposed\nrequirements regarding restricting communication of screenshots, and in particular, the\nrequirement that health IT developers put all potential communicators on sufficient written notice\nof each aspect of its screen display that contains third-party content that cannot be communicated\nbecause it would infringe IP rights. Some commenters stated that the proposed language should\nbe amended to require a list of third-party content that might appear in a screen or that the\ndeveloper sublicenses, or to require a notice on the developer’s website. Other commenters stated\nthat the proposal should be removed. One commenter recommended ONC consider not making\ndevelopers accountable for actions by health IT users regarding the disclosure of screenshots with\nthird-party information. One commenter requested additional guidance from ONC for dealing\nwith third-party, non-health IT content in health IT.\n\n*Response.* Where a health IT developer is prohibited by this rule from restricting the\ncommunication of a screenshot and allows a screenshot containing third-party content to be\ncommunicated, the health IT developer is acting as required by this final rule and enabling\nimportant communication regarding critical health IT issues to occur. Thus, we believe developers\nacting in accordance with this final rule should not be responsible for third-party content in\nscreenshots that are communicated as required by the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements. As such, in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(D) we have removed from the requirements related\nto third-party IP rights proposed in 84 FR 7475.\n\n(E) Testing and Development\nWe discussed in the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7475 that some health IT developers expose\n\n\n\n\naspects of their health IT to health care providers and others for the purpose of testing and\ndevelopment prior to a product’s “general availability” release. We stated that such disclosures\nmay relate to beta releases that are shared with certain customers for testing prior to the software\nbeing made generally available to the market, or may be made as part of a joint-venture or\ncooperative development process. In these circumstances, we proposed in 84 FR 7475 that a\nhealth IT developer would be justified in keeping information about its health IT confidential. We\nexplained that this permitted prohibition or restriction would allow developers to seek appropriate\nIP protection and discuss novel, “unreleased” product features with their customer base, which\nhas significant public policy benefits for research and innovation in the health IT industry.\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7475 that this permitted restriction would be limited and would not\napply to communications that are subject to unqualified protection as specified in proposed §\n170.403(a)(2)(i). We proposed that this permitted restriction would also not apply to\ncommunications about the released version of the health IT once the health IT has been released.\n\nWe requested comment on whether we should limit the time this protection would apply\nfor testing purposes. We also requested comment on whether we should set specific parameters\nfor covered testing.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters stated that there should be no limit on how long\ntesting and development could last for the purpose of the restrictions that developers would be\nallowed to place on communications regarding products in development. These commenters\nstressed that any limit would be arbitrary and that until certified health IT is in live commercial\nuse, health IT developers should be permitted to restrict communications about it.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenters and did not propose to add a time limit on\ntesting and development phases for the purpose of this Condition of Certification requirement.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters requested clarification that providers testing products\n\n\n\n\nin real-world environments would not be considered “contractors” of developers for the purpose\nof the Communications Condition of Certification requirements because such treatment could\nresult in developers being allowed to place additional communication restrictions on employees\nand contractors under the Communication Condition of Certification requirements. One comment\nalso stated that restrictions on communications by employees and contractors should not extend to\ntheir communications regarding product features and functionality that the employees and\ncontractors were not involved in developing or testing.\n\n*Response.* The applicability of this allowable restriction to providers testing products\nwould be determined by the particular facts at issue and whether or not the provider was an actual\ncontractor, employee, or consultant for the developer. We also clarify that this final rule does not\nlimit the restrictions a developer may place on an employee, contractor, or consultant with regard\nto protected communications, except to the extent that the communication is one with unqualified\nprotection, in which case no such restrictions would be allowed.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that a health IT user must have used health IT\nin a real-world context before a communication by the user about the health IT can be protected.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized our proposal in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii)(E) that a health IT\ndeveloper would be justified in keeping information about its health IT confidential prior to a\nproduct’s “general availability” release. We note that a health IT developer would also be justified\nin keeping information about a product update confidential because the update is not yet generally\navailable. We do not place any limits on who the communicator has to be in order to be covered\nby the Communications Condition of Certification requirements, particularly since the protections\nin the Communications Condition of Certification requirements extend beyond users of certified\nhealth IT to cover researchers and other stakeholders who may experience certified health IT in a\nvariety of settings and scenarios. As such, we have decided not to limit the communication\n\n\n\n\nprotection to only those communications that are made by users of certified health IT in the real-\nworld context.\nc. Maintenance of Certification Requirements\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7476 that to maintain compliance with the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements, a health IT developer must not establish or enforce any\ncontract or agreement provision that contravenes the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements. We also proposed in 84 FR 7476 that a health IT developer must notify all entities\nor individuals with which it has a contract/agreement related to certified health IT that any\ncommunication or contract/agreement provision that contravenes the Communications Condition\nof Certification requirements will not be enforced by the health IT developer. We proposed in 84\nFR 7476 that such notification must occur within six months of the effective date of the final rule.\n\nFurther, we proposed in 84 FR 7476 that this notice would need to be provided annually up to and\nuntil the health IT developer amends the contract or agreement to remove or make void any\ncontractual provision that contravenes the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements. We further proposed as a Maintenance of Certification requirement in proposed §\n170.403(b)(2) that health IT developers must amend their contracts/agreements to remove or\nmake void any provisions that contravene the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements within a reasonable period of time, but not later than two years from the effective\ndate of a final rule.\n\nIn the event that a health IT developer cannot, despite all reasonable efforts, locate an\nentity or individual that previously entered into an agreement with the developer that prohibits or\nrestricts communications protected by the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements, we proposed in 84 FR 7476 that the developer would not be in contravention of the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements so long as it takes no step to enforce the\n\n\n\n\nprohibition or restriction. We did not propose that health IT developers be required to furnish to\nONC or their ONC-ACB copies of notices made to customers, or copies of contracts or\nagreements revised, in satisfaction of this Maintenance of Certification requirement, although we\nnoted that those communications could be requested by ONC or an ONC-ACB in the usual course\nof business or to demonstrate compliance.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed concerns regarding the proposed\ndeadlines for complying with the requirements. Several commenters stated that the requirement to\nnotify customers and others with whom the developer has contracts or agreements within six\nmonths was too long and recommended that the deadline be shortened. Regarding the deadline for\namending contracts/agreements that contravene the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements, most commenters stated that the deadline was too short, with several requesting that\nit be extended to five years. Some other commenters recommended that modification of any\ncontracts/agreements to comply with the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirements should occur whenever such contracts/agreements are renewed, or at the earliest\navailable time, without the need for a specific deadline. A couple of commenters recommended\nthat a health IT developer not be held responsible for amending contracts within two years of the\neffective date of the final rule if it has made reasonable efforts to do so. Several comments\nrecommended that ONC should allow alternative means of completing this requirement, such as\nposting relevant language on the developer’s website. One commenter stated that it would be\nhelpful to have a “standard exception clause” that developers could use in their contracts and\nagreements.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments we received on this provision. We clarify in §\n170.403(b)(2)(i) that a developer may not include provisions that contravene the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements in any new contract as of the effective date of the final\n\n\n\n\nrule. In consideration of comments, we have decided to modify the timeframe requirement\nproposed in 84 FR 7476 for amending contracts/agreements to be in compliance with this\ncondition. While we considered extending the deadline to five years to allow developers to have\nadditional time for compliance, we determined that a more flexible solution is appropriate. As\nsuch, we have modified the requirement in § 170.405(b)(2)(ii) to state that any\ncontracts/agreements in place as of the effective date of the final rule and containing language in\ncontravention of the Communications Condition of Certification requirements must be revised to\nremove or void the contractual provision that contravenes the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements whenever the contract is next modified for any reason. We clarify that\nwhere a contract automatically renews, the developer would still be prohibited under the Program\nfrom enforcing any agreement or contract provisions that contravene the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements in § 170.403(a) and the developer would also be\nresponsible for sending an annual notice as described above until such provisions have been\nmodified. To note, we decline to absolve a developer of the requirement to modify the contract\nsolely because the developer has made a reasonable effort to do so.\n\nWe finalized the notification requirements proposed in 84 FR 7476. A health IT developer\nmust notify all entities and individuals with which it has a contract/agreement related to certified\nhealth IT that any communication or contract/agreement provision that contravenes the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements will not be enforced by the health IT\ndeveloper. However, we no longer require that such notification must occur within six months of\nthe effective date of the final rule and annually thereafter until contravening provisions are\namended. Instead, notification must only occur annually, beginning in calendar year 2020, and\ncontinue until all contravening provisions are amended. Given the timing of the publication of the\nfinal rule, health IT developers could have potentially been required to provide both initial\n\n\n\n\nnotification and an annual notification in the same calendar year. We believe the removal of the\nsix months notification deadline and retention of an annual requirement only, beginning with\nnotification in calendar year 2020, will simplify compliance for health IT developers while still\nproviding adequate notice and ensuring that initial notification is provided in a reasonable amount\nof time. Therefore we have finalized the deadline for the notice requirement in § 170.403(b)(1) to\nbe annually, beginning in calendar year 2020.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification that once the final rule goes into\neffect, contravening provisions in developer contracts prohibiting communications cannot be\nenforced. One of these commenters stated that developers would often include language in their\ncontracts prohibiting communication on the part of end users and entities, thus preventing\ncommunication about issues with EHRs. Several commenters requested that ONC explicitly state\nthat any permitted communication made following the effective date of the final rule be\ninadmissible as a violation of a contract/agreement regardless of whether the customer has been\nnotified. One commenter requested that ONC clarify that, with respect to protecting\ncommunications regarding developer business practices, where the disclosure of certain\ninformation is prohibited by contract, the developer would not be liable for its inability to\ncommunicate such information.\n\n*Response.* We emphasize that as of the effective date of the final rule, contravening\nprovisions in contracts or agreements cannot be enforced without the risk of losing certification\nfor the developer’s health IT or a certification ban for the developer under the Program, regardless\nof whether the customer was notified as required by the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements. We clarify that provisions of contracts requiring that the health IT\ncustomer “flow-down” obligations onto the customer’s employees, contractors, and other users of\nthe health IT that would restrict protected communications would be in contravention of this\n\n\n\n\nCondition of Certification. Such provisions could not be enforced after the effective date of the\nfinal rule without risking loss of certification as noted above for the developer under the Program.\n\nWe appreciate commenters’ concern regarding disclosing information that may be\notherwise prohibited by contract. However, we clarify that the purpose of the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements is to prevent developers from improperly restricting\nprotected communications, including communications about a developer’s practices and policies\nrelated to facilitating the exchange of health information. As discussed earlier in this section,\ncosts, timeframes, licensing practices and terms, as well as the developer’s approach to working\nwith third-party services, could all be considered protected communications to the extent they\nrelate to facilitating the exchange of health information. Thus, we reiterate that where a contract\nentered into by the developer would restrict a communication protected by the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements, the developer may not enforce such a contract and may\nnot restrict a protected communication in violation of the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements after the effective date of the final rule without risking loss of\ncertification. It is also important to note that not all contractual provisions related to\ncommunications would create a risk of de-certification. As noted above, the Communications\nCondition of Certification requirements in § 170.403(a)(2)(ii) do allow for developers to place\nrestrictions on certain communications as discussed above. Therefore, contractual provisions that\nappropriately address those allowances would not create a risk of de-certification under the\nProgram.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that “renew” should be added to the maintenance\nrequirement to not establish or enforce any contract or agreement that contravenes the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements in § 170.403(a).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment and amended the proposed regulatory text in §\n\n\n\n\n170.403(b)(2)(i) to include “renew.” We clarify that where a contract auto-renews, the developer\nwould still be prohibited under the Program from enforcing any agreement or contract provisions\nthat contravene the Communications Condition of Certification requirements without risking loss\nof certification and would also be responsible for sending an annual notice as described above\nuntil such provisions have been modified.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters expressed concern about developer efforts to re-\nnegotiate other terms of a contract that are unrelated to protected communications as part of the\ncontract modification process.\n\n*Response.* We stress that the contract modifications required as part of the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirements are strictly limited to removing any\nprovisions of the relevant contract/agreement that would restrict protected communications in\ncontravention of the Communications Condition of Certification requirements and are not\nrequired to be done until the contract/agreement is modified for other purposes.\n\n4. Application Programming Interfaces\nThe API Condition of Certification requirement in Section 4002 of the Cures Act requires\nhealth IT developers to publish APIs that allow “health information from such technology to be\naccessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor\ntechnology or standards, as provided for under applicable law.” The requirement also states that\na developer must, through an API, “provide access to all data elements of a patient’s electronic\nhealth record to the extent permissible under applicable privacy laws.” Additionally, the API\nCondition of Certification requirement of the Cures Act includes several key phrases and\nrequirements for health IT developers that go beyond the technical functionality of the Health IT\nModules they present for certification. In this section of the preamble, we\n\n\n\n\noutline the proposals we have adopted to implement the API Condition of Certification\nrequirement of the Cures Act to provide compliance clarity for health IT developers.\n\nWe have adopted new standards, new implementation specifications, a new certification\ncriterion, Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements, and modified the Base EHR\ndefinition. Health IT developers should consider these final requirements in the context of\ninformation blocking provisions described in section VIII of this preamble.\na. Statutory Interpretation and API Policy Principles\nSection 4002 of the Cures Act requires health IT developers certified to the Program to\npublish APIs that allow “health information from such technology to be accessed, exchanged,\nand used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor technology or standards, as\nprovided for under applicable law.” To implement the Cures Act API requirements, we proposed\na new 2015 Edition Cures Update “API” certification criterion at 84 FR 7476 that included\nrequirements for an API to have \"read” capabilities that support two types of services: (1)\nservices for which a single patient’s data is the focus; and (2) services for which multiple\npatients’ data are the focus.\n\nWe conveyed in the Proposed Rule our belief that “without special effort” requires APIs\nand the health care ecosystem in which they are deployed to be standardized, transparent, and\npro-competitive. Therefore, we noted that any Health IT Module certified to the new 2015\nEdition Cures Update API criterion and a health IT developer’s business practices would have to\nhave these attributes.\nb. API Standards and Implementation Specifications\ni. Base Standard\nWe proposed in § 170.215(a)(1) at 84 FR 7477 to adopt HL7® FHIR® Draft Standard\nfor Trial Use (DSTU) 2 for reference in the criterion proposed in § 170.315(g)(10). Additionally,\n\n\n\n\nwe requested comment in 84 FR 7478 and 7479 on four options to determine the best version of\nHL7 FHIR to reference for use in § 170.315(g)(10): Option 1: FHIR DSTU 2, Option 2: FHIR\nDSTU 2 and FHIR Release 3, Option 3: FHIR DSTU 2 and FHIR Release 4, and Option 4: FHIR\nRelease 4 only. We requested commenters review the proposed certification criterion in §\n170.315(g)(10) and the accompanying Condition of Certification requirements attributed to the\nAPI certification criteria. Notably, we stated in the Proposed Rule at 84 FR 7479 that if we\nadopted another FHIR Release in a final rule as an alternative to FHIR Release 2 for the\nproposed API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), then we would also adopt the applicable\nimplementation specifications associated with the FHIR Release.\n\n*Comments.* We received overwhelming support for Option 4: adopt solely FHIR Release\n4 in the final rule for reference in § 170.315(g)(10). We received support for the adoption of\nFHIR Release 4 across a broad array of stakeholders, including health IT developers, medical\ntrade associations, software application developers, and payers. Commenters noted that FHIR\nRelease 4 is the first FHIR release with normative FHIR resources and support for enhanced\ncapabilities. Most commenters emphasized that Option 4 will allow the industry to unify and\nfocus on a single baseline standard, rather than accommodating multiple releases proposed in\nOptions 2 and 3. A minority of commenters suggested alternative or multiple versions, noting\nthis would allow for flexibility, but the vast majority of commenters supported the adoption of\nFHIR Release 4 only.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and agree with commenters that adoption of a\nsingle standard is the best option to align industry and enable widespread interoperability. We\nhave adopted the latest version of the standard at the time of this final rule publication (FHIR\nRelease 4.0.1) in § 170.215(a)(1) and finalized its use in § 170.315(g)(10).\nii. United States Core Data for Interoperability\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed in § 170.215(a)(2) at 84 FR 7479 to adopt the API Resource Collection in\nHealth (ARCH) Version 1 implementation specification, which listed a set of base HL7®\nFHIR® resources that Health IT Modules certified to the proposed criterion in § 170.315(g)(10)\nwould need to support.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters were opposed to the adoption of the ARCH in the final\nrule. Commenters argued for the use of American National Standards Institute accredited\nstandards, and suggested ONC work with standards developing organizations for standards\ndevelopment and maintenance.\n\nSeveral commenters noted that the ARCH has not gone through a formal balloting\nprocess, did not support ONC’s proposal to rely upon the National Technology Transfer and\nAdvancement Act’s exception to adopt the ARCH in the final rule, and encouraged the use of\ntechnical standards developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. Several\ncommenters noted that requiring the ARCH in addition to the other adopted standards could\ncreate confusion. Commenters further emphasized the importance of maintaining ongoing\nconsistency between the ARCH and the other adopted standards, and noted this would be\nchallenging to achieve.\n\nAdditional comments against the ARCH expressed concern with the proposed updates\nthrough the Standards Version Advancement Process, and with ONC over-regulating API\nfunctionality. Commenters also noted that ONC could encourage API access to specific data\nelements without creating a new implementation specification.\n\nSome commenters in favor of the ARCH implementation specification asked for data\nelement revisions. Commenters also asked for clarity that EHRs will not need to provide the full\nset of data to modular applications, and asked for specificity on how much of this data would\nneed to be mapped by the API Technology Supplier. Additionally, commenters asked for\n\n\n\n\nguidance on lab results, including application creation implementation guides that would ensure\naccuracy and compliance when incorporating lab data.\n\n*Response.* In response to commenters, we did not adopt the ARCH as an implementation\nspecification in the final rule. Upon consideration of public comments and in an effort to\nconsistently approach how we reference the United States Core Data for Interoperability\n(USCDI) with various content standards (e.g., C-CDA), we determined that having an\nimplementation specification to map USCDI to HL7 FHIR could create more restrictions than\nwe intended. We appreciate the concerns raised by stakeholders, and as we evaluated the ARCH\nin context of our other proposals, we determined that we could achieve our desired policy\noutcome to link the USCDI Data Elements to FHIR Resources without the ARCH. We refer\ncommenters to the sections that follow for further clarity regarding the implementation of Data\nElements included in the USCDI implementation specification (IV.B.1).\niii. US Core IG and Bulk IG\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7480 in § 170.215(a)(3) to adopt the Argonaut Data Query\nImplementation Guide version 1 (Argonaut IG) implementation specification, which specifies\nconstraints for 13 of the HL7® FHIR® resources proposed in § 170.215(a)(2). Additionally, we\nproposed in § 170.215(a)(4) to adopt the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server\nimplementation specification.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters advocated for the adoption of the FHIR US Core\nImplementation Guide STU 3 Release 3.0.0 implementation specification instead of the\nArgonaut Implementation Guides. Commenters noted that the US Core Implementation Guide\nwas built from the Argonaut Implementation Guides and has been balloted by the standards\ncommunity.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We note that in the Proposed Rule at\n84 FR 7479 we stated that if we were to adopt another FHIR Release in the final rule as an\nalternative to FHIR Release 2, then we would also adopt the applicable implementation\nspecifications and FHIR profiles associated with the FHIR Release. Considering this and\ncommenters’ recommendations, we have adopted the HL7 FHIR US Core Implementation Guide\nSTU 3.1.0 (US Core IG) implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(2). We note that we\nadopted the latest version of the US Core IG at the time of the final rule publication. The US\nCore IG defines the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data using FHIR\nRelease 4 (adopted in § 170.215(a)(1)), including profiled resources, operations, and search\nparameters for the Data Elements required in the USCDI implementation specification (adopted\nin § 170.213).\n\nWe note that in the Proposed Rule at 84 FR 7479 we proposed to require that the\n“Patient.address” and “Patient.telecom” elements of the “Patient” resource must be supported.\n\nWe note these requirements have since been subsumed by the US Core IG, given that\n“Patient.address” and “Patient.telecom” elements are both flagged “must support” for the\n“Patient” profile in the US Core IG. We also proposed to require that the “Device.udi” element\nfollow the human readable representation of the unique device identifier found in the\nrecommendation, guidance, and conformance requirements section of the “HL7 Version 3 Cross\nParadigm Implementation Guide: Medical Devices and Unique Device Identification Pattern,\nRelease 1.” These requirements have also been subsumed by the US Core IG. Additional\ninformation can be found in the “Device” profile of the US Core IG adopted in § 170.215(a)(2).\n\nWe note that in the Proposed Rule we proposed in 84 FR 7480 that the clinical note text\nincluded in the “DocumentReference” resource would need to be represented in its “raw” text\nform, and further proposed in 84 FR 7480 that it would be unacceptable for the note text to be\n\n\n\n\nconverted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API\nresponse. We clarify that the clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the\n“Clinical Notes Guidance” section of the US Core IG adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) must be\nrepresented in a “plain text” form, and would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to\nanother file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response.\n\nWe note that in the Proposed Rule we proposed in 84 FR 7480 to require that the\n“Provenance.recorded” and “Provenance.agent.actor” elements of the “Provenance” resource\nmust be supported. We note these requirements have been subsumed by the US Core IG, given\nthat “Provenance.recorded” and “Provenance.agent.who” elements are both flagged “must\nsupport” for the “Provenance” profile in the US Core IG.\n\nAs addressed under the header “Standardized API for Patient and Population Services” in\nthe section V.B.4.c, we have finalized the adoption of the HL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat\nFHIR) (v1.0.0: STU 1) implementation specification (Bulk IG), including mandatory support for\nthe “group-export” “OperationDefinition” in § 170.215(a)(4).\niv. HL7 SMART IG and Backend Services Authorization\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7481 in § 170.215(a)(5) to adopt the HL7® SMART Application\nLaunch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 implementation specification, a profile\nof the OAuth 2.0 specification.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters expressed support for the HL7 SMART Application\nLaunch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0 (SMART IG) implementation\nspecification. Multiple commenters suggested that in addition to requiring support for “refresh\ntokens,” “Standalone Launch,” and “EHR Launch” capabilities from the SMART IG, ONC also\nrequire support for “sso-openid-connect,” “launch-standalone,” “launch-ehr,” “client-public,”\n\n\n\n\n“client-confidentialsymmetric,” “context-ehr-patient,” “context-standalone-patient,”\n\n“permission-patient,” “permission-user,” and “permission-offline” capabilities.\n\n*Response.* We thank stakeholders for their comments. The ten optional capabilities\ncommenters suggested are included in the “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” section of the\nSMART IG. The “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” suggested by commenters include “sso-\nopenid-connect,” which allows for support of the OpenID Connect profile in the SMART IG;\n“client-public” and “client-confidential-symmetric,” which allow for client authentication;\n“context-ehr-patient” and “context-standalone-patient,” which provide context to apps at launch\ntime; and “permission-patient,” “permission-user,” and “permission-offline,” which allow\nsupport for patient-level scopes, user-level scopes, and refresh tokens, respectively. Other\n“SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” that were not suggested by commenters include “context-\nbanner” and “context-style,” which provide basic context to apps at launch time, and ”context-\nehr-encounter” and “context-standalone-encounter,” which provide encounter-level granularity\nto apps at launch time. Given the importance of these “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities,” and\nin consideration of public comments and our own research, we have adopted the SMART IG,\nincluding mandatory support for the “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” in § 170.215(a)(3).\n\nWe explicitly require mandatory support of the “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” in §\n170.215(a)(3) because these capabilities are indicated as optional in the implementation\nspecification. We further clarify these “SMART on FHIR Core Capabilities” are in scope for\nProgram testing and certification. Additionally, we clarify that by requiring the “permission-\npatient” “SMART on FHIR Core Capability” in § 170.215(a)(3), Health IT Modules presented\nfor testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to\nreceive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would\nneed to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level,\n\n\n\n\nfrom one specific FHIR resource (e.g., “Immunization”) up to all FHIR resources necessary to\nimplement the standard adopted in § 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in\n§ 170.215(a)(2). This capability will give patients increased control over how much EHI they\nauthorize applications of their choice to receive. For example, if a patient downloaded a\nmedication management application, they would be able to use these authorization scopes to\nlimit the EHI accessible by the application to only information contained in FHIR\n“MedicationRequest” and “Medication” profile.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters noted concerns for privacy and security of APIs.\n\nSpecifically, one commenter explained the threat of cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and\nsuggested we take action to mitigate that risk, including by requiring the use of both OAuth 2.0\nand OpenID Connect Core 1.0.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by commenters regarding the privacy\nand security of APIs. The OAuth 2.0 standard defined at Request For Comment (RFC) 6749101\ndescribes that “[The OAuth 2.0 authorization] framework was designed with the clear\nexpectation that future work will define prescriptive profiles and extensions necessary to achieve\nfull web-scale interoperability.” The SMART IG serves as a “prescriptive profile” as described\nin RFC 6749. Thus, consistent with commenters’ recommendations, we have adopted a profile of\nthe OAuth 2.0 standard (SMART IG) in § 170.215(a)(3). Additionally, we have adopted OpenID\nConnect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1 in § 170.215(b), and require conformance with the\nrelevant parts of this standard as part of testing and certification. CSRF is a well-documented\nsecurity threat in OAuth 2.0, which can be prevented with adequate security practices. We\nencourage implementers to adhere to industry best practices to mitigate CSRF and other known\n101\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749\n\n\n\n\nsecurity threats. Relatedly, we note that the HL7 community has developed an “Implementer’s\nSafety Check List,”102\na guide of security best practices for implementing FHIR-based APIs. We\nencourage stakeholders to consult this guide during development and implementation of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules to minimize security risks.\n\nFor backend services authorization, as addressed under the header “Standardized API for\nPatient and Population Services” in the section V.B.4.c, we have finalized the adoption of the\nHL7 FHIR Bulk Data Access (Flat FHIR) (v1.0.0: STU 1) implementation specification (Bulk\nIG), which includes the “Backend Services Authorization Guide” in § 170.215(a)(4).\nv. OpenID Connect\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7480 through 7481 in § 170.215(b) to adopt OpenID Connect\nCore 1.0 including errata set 1.\n\n*Comments.* We received few comments regarding the adoption of OpenID Connect Core\n1.0 including errata set 1, however, commenters generally supported the adoption of this\nstandard.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. Given their support, we have\nfinalized the adoption of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 including errata set 1 as proposed in §\n170.215(b). We clarify that only the relevant parts of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 including\nerrata set 1 adopted in § 170.215(b) that are also included in the implementation specification\nadopted in § 170.215(a)(3) will be in-scope for testing and certification.\nc. Standardized API for Patient and Population Services\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7481 to adopt a new certification criterion, § 170.315(g)(10), to\nreplace § 170.315(g)(8), and we proposed in 84 FR 7495 to update the 2015 Edition Base EHR\n102\nhttps://www.hl7.org/FHIR/safety.html\n\n\n\n\ndefinition, as referenced in § 170.102. The proposed certification criterion would require Health\nIT Modules to support API-enabled “read” services for single and multiple patients. “Read”\nservices include those that allow authenticated and authorized third-party applications to view\nEHI through a secure API. These services specifically exclude “write” capabilities, where\nauthenticated and authorized third-party applications would be able to create or modify EHI\nthrough a secure API.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters supported the proposed adoption of a new certification criterion,\n§ 170.315(g)(10), to replace § 170.315(g)(8).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support from commenters. As a result, we have adopted a\nnew certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), to replace § 170.315(g)(8) and made several\nrevisions to address public comment as discussed further below. Although the certification\ncriteria finalized at § 170.315(g)(10) will replace § 170.315(g)(8), we note that § 170.315(g)(8)\nis not removed from regulation. We maintain § 170.315(g)(8) and have finalized in § 170.550(m)\nthat ONC-ACBs can issue certificates for § 170.315(g)(8) during the transition period to §\n170.315(g)(10) for 24 months after the publication date of the final rule.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested dividing the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion into two\nseparate criteria for single and multiple patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. We decline to split the certification criterion into\ntwo criteria. In consideration of comments and for clarity, we have improved the organization of\nthe final certification requirements for API-enabled “read” services for single and multiple\npatients by separating the criterion into distinct sections in the regulation text.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported referencing a standard for API-enabled “read”\nservices for multiple patients, including the HL7® FHIR® Bulk Data Access Implementation\n\n\n\n\nGuide Release 1.0.0. Commenters felt that omitting a standard in the criterion would undermine\ninteroperability for API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. To enable consistent health IT\nimplementation of API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients, we have finalized the\nadoption of the Bulk IG, including mandatory support for the “group-export”\n\n“OperationDefinition” in § 170.215(a)(4). As part of the Program, we require Health IT Modules\npresented for testing and certification to conform to the Bulk IG implementation specification\nfinalized in § 170.215(a)(4). The adoption of an implementation specification for API-enabled\n“read” services for multiple patients in § 170.215(a)(4) is responsive to stakeholder concerns and\nfurther supports our intent to prevent “special effort” for the use of APIs as mandated in section\n4002 of the Cures Act. Furthermore, based on our analysis, we believe the “group-export”\n\n“OperationDefinition,” as defined in the Bulk IG implementation specification is essential to\nfulfill the use cases envisioned for API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients. The\n“group-export” “OperationDefinition” will allow application developers interacting with §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules to export the complete set of FHIR resources as\nconstrained by the US Core IG adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) and USCDI adopted in § 170.213 for\na pre-defined cohort of patients. We appreciate commenters’ recommendations, and agree that\ncoalescing around a common implementation specification will advance interoperability of API-\nenabled “read” services for multiple patients. We provide further discussion of the supported\nsearch operations, data response, and authentication and authorization requirements for API-\nenabled “read” services for multiple patients in the sections below.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarification that API-enabled “read” services for\nmultiple patients are not intended for patient end users and that health IT developers and health\n\n\n\n\ncare providers are therefore not expected to supply a patient-facing mechanism for these\nrequests.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. API-enabled “read” services for\nmultiple patients are not intended for patient end users because API-enabled “read” services for\nmultiple patients allow for the disclosure of multiple patients’ records, and individual patients\nonly have the right to access their own records or records of patients to whom they are the\npersonal representative (45 CFR 164.502(f)(1)). Health IT Modules are not required to support\npatient-facing API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients for the purposes of this\ncertification criterion.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested we modify the language that defines the purpose\nof this section to provide more clarity, specifically the term “services.” The commenter also\nrequested we include the scope of cohorts we intended to address in “population services.”\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. The term “services” includes\nall § 170.315(g)(10)-related technical capabilities included in a Health IT Module presented for\ntesting and certification. The API-enabled “read” services for single patients is intended to\nsupport EHI requests and responses for individual patient records and the API-enabled “read”\nservices for multiple patients is intended to support EHI requests and responses for multiple\npatients’ records. The scope of patient cohorts for “population services” can include various\ngroups defined at the discretion of the user of the API-enabled “read” services for multiple\npatients, including, for example, a group of patients that meet certain disease criteria or fall under\na certain insurance plan. We have adopted the Bulk IG in § 170.215(a)(4) to support this function\nas discussed further below. The technical capabilities expected of API-related Health IT Modules\npresented for testing and certification are included in § 170.315(g)(10).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarification for information blocking policies and\nhealth care provider obligations for API-enabled “read” services for multiple patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the request for clarification from commenters. We clarify that\nthe criteria finalized in § 170.315(g)(10) includes the technical capabilities that must be met by\nAPI-related Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification. The information blocking\npolicies in this rule do not compel health care providers to implement Health IT Modules\ncertified to requirements in 170.315(g)(10). We note that other programs, like CMS value-based\nprograms, may require the use of this technology. We refer commenters to the information\nblocking section (VIII) for additional clarification.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters asked us to clarify the relationship between the API-enabled\n“read” services for single and multiple patients in § 170.315(g)(10) and the “EHI export”\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(10).\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for this request. The API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10)\nis separate from the “EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). While both criteria aim to\nadvance health IT in alignment with the Cures Act’s goal of “complete access, exchange, and use\nof all electronically accessible health information” for both single and multiple patients, the\ncriteria specifications and Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements are distinct.\n\nThe “EHI export” criterion focuses on a Health IT Module’s ability to electronically\nexport EHI, as defined in § 171.102, that can be stored at the time of certification by the product,\nof which the Health IT Module is a part. In contrast, the finalized API criterion in §\n170.315(g)(10) focuses on “read” services for single and multiple patients for the USCDI\n(adopted in § 170.213) Data Elements and US Core IG (adopted in § 170.215(a)(2)) FHIR\nprofiles. Additionally, the “EHI export” criterion finalized in § 170.315(b)(10) does not mandate\nconformance to standards or implementation specifications, whereas the criterion finalized in §\n\n\n\n\n170.315(g)(10) requires conformance to several standards and implementation specifications, as\ndescribed further below. We refer to the finalized “EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) for\nadditional information.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported requiring Health IT Modules to support API-\nenabled “write” services for single patients, either in this rule or in a future rulemaking. One\ncommenter suggested including a subset of data classes for “write” services for single patients,\nincluding “patient goals,” “patient-generated health data” (including patient-reported outcomes,\npatient generated device data, and questionnaires), and “care plans.” Another commenter\nsuggested adding a list of required operations (“read” and “write”) to USCDI elements, limited\nto “read” for this rulemaking.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. While we support the interest in\nAPI-enabled “write” services, we have not adopted such requirements. We do not believe API-\nenabled “write” services have reached a level of a maturity to warrant the addition of regulatory\nconformance requirements within the Program. We encourage industry to consider all the\nimplications and implementation requirements for API-enabled “write” services, and perform\nadditional API-enabled “write” pilot implementations to demonstrate the readiness for API-\nenabled “write” services in the testing and certification of Health IT Modules. Additionally, we\nencourage industry to expand existing profiles like the US Core IG to support “write” services.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended including a requirement for event logging for\n“read” services for single and multiple patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the recommendation from commenters. The 2015 Edition\nPrivacy and Security Certification Framework requires that if a Health IT Module includes\ncapabilities for certification under § 170.315(g)(10) it needs to be certified to several privacy and\n\n\n\n\nsecurity certification criteria including auditable events in § 170.315(d)(2) or auditing actions on\nhealth information in § 170.315(d)(10).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters noted that references to APIs focus exclusively on RESTful\nquery and ignore “push” elements of the FHIR API, such as “POST,” “PUT,” and FHIR\nmessaging.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. While we support the interest in\nthe “push” operations of the FHIR standard, including “POST,” “PUT,” and FHIR messaging,\nwe have not adopted such requirements for the Program. We encourage industry stakeholders to\nfurther consider all the requirements and implications for the “push” operations of the FHIR\nstandard, develop use cases, perform additional API-enabled “push” pilot implementations,\ncreate or expand implementation profiles to support “push” services, and demonstrate the utility\nof the “push” operations of the FHIR standard for future potential inclusion in the Program.\ni. Data Response\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7482 in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must be capable of responding to requests for data on single and multiple\npatients in accordance with proposed standards and implementation specifications adopted in §\n170.215(a)(1) (HL7® FHIR® DSTU 2 (v1.0.2-7202)), specified in the proposed § 170.215(a)(2)\n(API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH) Version 1), and consistent with the proposed\nspecifications in § 170.215(a)(3) (Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Version 1.0.0).\n\nWe clarified that all data elements indicated as “mandatory” and “must support” by the proposed\nstandards and implementation specifications must be supported and would be in scope for\ntesting.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concern with fully enforcing “mandatory” and “must”\nsupport requirements of the referenced specifications and implementation guides, explaining that\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers may be required to support requirements that are not applicable to the stated intended\nuse of the Health IT Module(s).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the concerns expressed by commenters. We clarify that the\nstandards and implementation specifications adopted and required for this certification criterion\nwere created by standards developing organizations to support a wide range of health care use\ncases.\n\nWe have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) that Health IT Modules presented for testing\nand certification must be capable of responding to requests for a single patient’s data according\nto the standard adopted in § 170.215(a)(1) and implementation specification adopted in §\n170.215(a)(2), including the mandatory capabilities described in “US Core Server\nCapabilityStatement,” for each of the Data Elements included in the standard adopted in §\n170.213. This requirement will enable Health IT Modules to support US Core IG operations for\neach of the Data Elements included in the USCDI.\n\nAdditionally, we have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(B) that Health IT Modules\npresented for testing and certification must be capable of responding to requests for data on\nmultiple patients as a group according to the standard adopted in § 170.215(a)(1) and\nimplementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) and § 170.215(a)(4), for each of the\nData Elements included in the standard adopted in § 170.213. Finally, we clarify that the use of\nthe “SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide” section of the implementation\nspecification adopted in § 170.215(a)(4) is required for API “read” services for multiple patients\nas finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(i)(B) and described above.\n\nFor requests for data on multiple patients, we note that the implementation specification\nadopted in § 170.215(a)(4) has optional parameters which can be used to filter results to a period\nof time, or one or several specified FHIR resources. While these parameters are not required for\n\n\n\n\ntesting and certification, we encourage health IT developers to adopt these parameters and other\n“OperationDefinitions” to enhance the utility of requests for data on multiple patients.\nii. Search Support\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7482 in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii) that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must be capable of responding to all of the “supported searches”\nspecified in the proposed implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(4) (Argonaut Data Query\nImplementation Guide Server). We reiterated that Health IT Modules presented for testing and\ncertification and as implemented must support all search capabilities for single and multiple\npatients in accordance with the proposed implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(4). We\nalso requested comments on the minimum “search” parameters that would need to be supported\nfor the ”DocumentReference” and “Provenance” HL7® FHIR® resources.\n\n*Comments.* Most commenters supported this proposal. One commenter recommended\nonly requiring the “target” query parameter for the “Provenance” FHIR resource, and “patient”\nand “date” query parameters for the “DocumentReference” FHIR resource. One commenter\nsuggested deferring this certification requirement until a standard is published by HL7.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Since we have not finalized the\nadoption of the ARCH as proposed in § 170.215(a)(2), and instead rely on the search parameters\nspecified in the US Core IG finalized in § 170.215(a)(2) and Bulk IG finalized in §\n170.215(a)(4), the comments related to the specific “Provenance” and “DocumentReference”\n\nFHIR resources are no longer applicable. We have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii)(A) that\nHealth IT Modules presented for testing and certification must support all search capabilities for\nsingle patients according to the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(2),\nincluding support for all mandatory capabilities included in the “US Core Server\nCapabilityStatement.” Additionally, we have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii)(B) that Health IT\n\n\n\n\nModules presented for testing and certification must respond to search requests for multiple\npatients’ data consistent with the search criteria included in the implementation specification\nadopted in § 170.215(a)(4). We clarify that the scope of data available in the data responses\ndefined in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) must be supported for single and multiple patient searches via the\nsupported search operations finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii). Additionally, we clarify for the\nrequirements finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(i) and (ii) that all data elements indicated as\n“mandatory,” “must support,” by the standards and implementation specifications must be\nsupported and are in scope for testing.\niii. Application Registration\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7483 in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) that Health IT Modules presented\nfor testing and certification must be capable of enabling apps to register with an “authorization\nserver.” As proposed, this would have required an API Technology Supplier to demonstrate its\nregistration process, but would not have required conformance to a standard. We requested\ncomment at 84 FR 7483 on whether to require the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\nProtocol (RFC 7591103\n) standard as the sole method to support registration for the proposed\ncertification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), and requested comment on whether we should require\nits support as part of the final rule’s certification criterion. Additionally, we requested comment\nat 84 FR 7483 on whether to include application registration in the testing and certification of\napps executed within an API Data Provider’s clinical environment.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must enable apps to register with an authorization server. Some\n103\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591\n\n\n\n\ncommenters supported excluding application registration from the testing and certification of\napps executed within an API Data Provider’s clinical environment.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Given the overwhelming\nsupport, we have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(iii) that Health IT Modules presented for testing\nand certification must enable apps to register with an authorization server. We clarify that Health\nIT Modules presented for testing and certification must support application registration\nregardless of the scope of patient search utilized by the application (e.g., single or multiple). This\ncertification criterion requires a health IT developer, as finalized in the Condition of Certification\nrequirements section below, to demonstrate its registration process, but does not require\nconformance to a standard. Additionally, we expect that apps executed within an implementer’s\nclinical environment will be registered with an authorization server, but we do not require a\nhealth IT developer to demonstrate its registration process for these “provider-facing” apps. We\nreiterate that we believe implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules should\nhave the discretion to innovate and execute various methods for application registration within a\nclinical environment.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters provided a mix of support and opposition for requiring the\nOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC 7591) standard as the sole method of\napplication registration. Some commenters felt that the Program should require dynamic client\nregistration in the context of patient-access scenarios only, and others felt the standard is not\nready for mandated adoption in the Program. Commenters opposed to requiring the OAuth 2.0\nDynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC 7591) felt that not specifying a standard would\nallow flexibility for different innovative registration approaches to be used and developed. Other\ncommenters suggested there should be an option for data holders to support dynamic client\n\n\n\n\napplication registration if the data holder prefers that approach, including support for dynamic\napplication registration via trusted networks.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We have not adopted a\nrequirement for Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification to support the OAuth\n2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC 7591) standard. We agree with commenters and\nbelieve that requiring registration without a mandated standard will allow registration models to\ndevelop further. We encourage health IT developers to coalesce around the development and\nimplementation of a common standard for application registration with an API’s authorization\nserver.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested permitting implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified\nHealth IT Modules to undertake a review of third-party applications prior to permitting them to\nconnect to the implementers’ deployed APIs.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the suggestion from commenters. The requirement that health\nIT developers must enable an application to register with the § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health\nIT Module’s authorization server only applies for the purposes of demonstrating technical\nconformance to the finalized certification criterion and Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements. The practices by all parties (including implementers of Health IT\nModules) other than developers of certified Health IT Modules are not in scope for this\ncertification criterion nor the associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. All other practices associated with third-party application review or “vetting” by\nimplementers must not violate the information blocking provision described in section VIII of\nthis preamble and applicable laws and regulations. In general, an implementer of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules (e.g., health care providers) would be allowed to\nreview third-party applications the implementer intends to use for its own business use (e.g., a\n\n\n\n\nthird-party decision-support application used by the health care provider in the course of\nfurnishing care) prior to permitting the third-party applications to connect to the implementer’s\ndeployed APIs within its enterprise and clinical users’ workflow. However, implementers of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules (e.g., health care providers) are not permitted to\nreview or “vet” third-party applications intended for patient access and use (see section VII.C.6\nof this preamble). We clarify that the third-party application registration process that a health IT\ndeveloper must meet under this criterion is not a form of review or “vetting” for purposes of this\ncriterion.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarity on whether the “EHR Launch” scenario was\nout of scope for testing during registration with an authorization server.\n\n*Response.* Commenters referred to the “EHR Launch” scenario, which is the “launch-ehr\"\n\n“SMART on FHIR Core Capability” included in the implementation specification adopted in §\n170.215(a)(3). Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must enable all apps that\nutilize the SMART IG “launch-standalone” “SMART on FHIR Core Capability” to register with\nan authorization server. We reiterate that the application registration requirement finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(iii) does not require conformance to a standard or implementation specification.\n\nWe envision that apps using only the SMART IG “launch-ehr” “SMART on FHIR Core\nCapability” will be tightly integrated with § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules\ndeployed by implementers, and will be able to accommodate registration processes that best suit\nthe needs of those implementers. Additionally, while we do not require conformance to a\nstandard or implementation specification for application registration, we clarify that Health IT\nModules presented for testing and certification are required to support application registration\nfunctions to enable authentication and authorization as finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(v).\niv. Secure Connection\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7483 in § 170.315(g)(10)(iv) that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must be capable of establishing a secure and trusted connection with an\napplication requesting patient data in accordance with the proposed § 170.215(a)(5) (HL7\nSMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0), including\nmandatory support for “Standalone Launch” and “EHR Launch” modes.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters asked for clarification around where “Standalone Launch” and\n“EHR Launch” capabilities are required, suggesting that “Standalone Launch” support be used\nexclusively for patient access and “EHR Launch” support be used exclusively for\nprovider/clinician access. They also noted that testing and certification of “Standalone Launch”\nwould not be a valid use case and should be excluded from the certification criterion.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. The SMART IG “Standalone\nLaunch” and “EHR Launch” modes can be used by both provider- and patient-facing\napplications. We refer to the adopted implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(3) for\nclarification of certification requirements for the SMART IG. We have finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(iv)(A) that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must\ndemonstrate the ability to establish a secure and trusted connection with an application\nrequesting data for a single patient in accordance with the implementation specifications adopted\nin § 170.215(a)(2) and (a)(3). We amended this text from the Proposed Rule by adding the US\nCore IG implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) because the US Core IG\nspecifically requires Transport Layer Security 1.2 (RFC 5246104\n) or higher for all transmissions\nnot taking place over a secure network connection. Pursuant to this adopted implementation\n104\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246\n\n\n\n\nspecification, we will test Health IT Modules for support for all “SMART on FHIR Core\nCapabilities” including both “launch-ehr\" and “launch-standalone.”\n\nAdditionally, we have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(iv)(B) that Health IT Modules\npresented for testing and certification must demonstrate the ability to establish a secure and\ntrusted connection with an application requesting data for multiple patients in accordance with\nthe implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(4). The implementation specification\nadopted in § 170.215(a)(4) has several sections, but for testing and certification to this criterion,\nwe specifically require conformance to, but not limited to, the “SMART Backend Services:\nAuthorization Guide.”\nv. Authentication and Authorization\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7483 in § 170.315(g)(10)(v) that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must demonstrate the ability to perform user authentication, user\nauthorization, and issue a refresh token valid for a period of at least 3 months during its initial\nconnection with an application to access data for a single patient in accordance with the proposed\nstandard in § 170.215(b) (OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1) and the proposed\nimplementation specification in § 170.215(a)(5) (HL7® SMART Application Launch\nFramework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0). Additionally, we proposed in §\n170.315(g)(10)(vi) that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must\ndemonstrate the ability of an application to access data for a single patient and multiple patients\nduring subsequent connections of applications capable of storing a client secret, in accordance\nwith the proposed implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(5) (HL7 SMART Application\nLaunch Framework Implementation Guide Release 1.0.0), without requiring the user to re-\nauthorize and re-authenticate when a valid refresh token is supplied. Additionally, we proposed\n\n\n\n\nin 84 FR 7483 that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must demonstrate it\ncan issue a new refresh token to an application, valid for a period of at least 3 months.\n\n*Comments.* A majority of commenters supported that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must demonstrate the ability to perform user authentication, user\nauthorization, and issue a refresh token valid for a period of at least 3 months. Some commenters\nnoted that the OAuth 2.0 implementation guide does not recommend servers provide refresh\ntokens to public / non-confidential applications.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. Given the general support and in\nresponse to these comments, we have consolidated the proposed requirements in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v) and § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) as a revised set of requirements finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v). Specifically, we have finalized requirements for authentication and\nauthorization for patient and user scopes in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A) and requirements for\nauthentication and authorization for system scopes in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B). We have focused\nthe revised requirements around authentication and authorization scopes to remove any\nconfusion associated with requirements for single and multiple patients. We have finalized\nauthentication and authorization requirements for first time connections for patient and user\nscopes in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1). This include the requirement finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(i) that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must\ndemonstrate that authentication and authorization occurs during the process of granting access to\npatient data in accordance with the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3) and\nstandard adopted in § 170.215(b). It also includes the requirement finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(1)(ii) that an application capable of storing a client secret must be issued a\nrefresh token valid for a period of no less than three months. Additionally, we have finalized\nauthentication and authorization requirements for subsequent connections for patient and user\n\n\n\n\nscopes in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2). This includes the requirements finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2)(i) that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must\ndemonstrate that access is granted to patient data in accordance with the implementation\nspecification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3) without requiring re-authorization and re-authentication\nwhen a valid refresh token is supplied by the application. It also includes the requirements\nfinalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2)(ii) that an application capable of storing a client secret\nmust be issued a new refresh token valid for a new period of no less than three months.\n\nAdditionally, we have finalized requirements for authentication and authorization for\nsystem scopes in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B), which require that Health IT Modules presented for\ntesting and certification must demonstrate that authentication and authorization occurs during the\nprocess of granting an application access to patient data in accordance with the “SMART\nBackend Services: Authorization Guide” section of the implementation specification adopted in\n§ 170.215(a)(4) and the application must be issued a valid access token. We note that for system\nscopes, applications will likely be authorized via a prior authorization negotiation and agreement\nbetween applications and Health IT Modules.\n\nFor clarity, we use the term “an application capable of storing a client secret” to refer to\n“confidential clients.” In the definition at RFC 6749, “confidential” clients are “clients capable\nof maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server\nwith restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using\nother means.” RFC 6749 also defines “public” clients as “clients incapable of maintaining the\nconfidentiality of their credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the resource\nowner, such as an installed native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable\nof secure client authentication via any other means.” We clarify that the term “an application\ncapable of storing a client secret” specifically excludes “public” clients.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we clarify that Health IT Modules will be explicitly tested for US Core IG\noperations using authentication and authorization tokens acquired via the process described in\nthe implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3), and Health IT Modules will be\nexplicitly tested for Bulk IG operations using authentication and authorization tokens acquired\nvia the process described in the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(4).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that ONC introduce a Condition of\nCertification requirement to ensure that implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModules can obtain automated system-level access to all API calls from the API servers offered\nby the Certified Health IT Developers (e.g., via the SMART Backend Services authorization\nguide), with “system/*.*” scopes.\n\n*Response.* We decline to accept the recommendation to require “system/*.*” scopes as a\ncertification requirement in § 170.315(g)(10). Insofar as the commenter requested that Health IT\nModules make available automated system-level scopes for the purposes of an “all information\nexport,” we have finalized a similar requirement in § 170.315(b)(10), and refer the commenter to\nthat section for additional detail. Additionally, we have finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(v)(B) that\nHealth IT Modules must perform authentication and authorization during the process of granting\nan application access to patient data using system scopes in accordance with the “SMART\nBackend Services: Authorization Guide” section of the implementation specification adopted in\n§ 170.215(a)(4). We recognize that the capabilities supported by “SMART Backend Services:\nAuthorization Guide” could be used for many other use cases that are currently not required by\nthe criterion. We clarify that implementers of Health IT Modules are not prohibited from\nconfiguring Health IT Modules to support the backend “system” scope described in the\n“SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide” section of the Bulk IG adopted in §\n170.215(a)(4) for API-enabled “read” services defined in the US Core IG. Indeed, we strongly\n\n\n\n\nencourage health IT developers to support these use cases as they develop in order to make full\nuse of the certified functions of Health IT Modules and advance the state of the industry.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested specifying that refresh tokens apply exclusively to\npatient access scenarios, noting that there are too many security risks to allow persistent tokens\nfor provider-facing applications. Additionally, commenters suggested permitting Health IT\nModules to support the revocation of refresh tokens in appropriate scenarios to address\nlegitimate security concerns.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We do not agree that there are\ntoo many security risks to allow refresh tokens to be used for provider-facing applications.\n\nRefresh tokens are commonly used in health care and other industries to provide seamless\nintegration of systems with other applications while reducing the need for the burdensome\nprocess of re-authentication and re-authorization. We expect implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-\ncertified Health IT Modules to have the capability of revoking refresh tokens where appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, we clarify that implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules are\nnot prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens for users of the API including patients\nand providers to align with their institutional policies. However, implementers of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules should be mindful of information blocking\nprovisions applicable to them and that requiring patients to re-authenticate and re-authorize at a\nhigh frequency could inhibit patient access and implicate information blocking.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested amending the time from three months to 12 months.\n\nOne commenter agreed that the patient token should be valid for three months, but suggested the\nprovider token be limited to 24 hours. One commenter suggested requiring re-authentication\nevery time information is sought via APIs.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We believe a refresh token\nvalid for a period of three months is sufficient to balance persistent access and security concerns.\n\nMoreover, for subsequent connections of applications capable of storing a client secret, Health\nIT Modules are required to issue a new refresh token valid for a new period of no shorter than\nthree months per the API certification criterion requirement finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A)(2)(ii). Given this requirement, we anticipate that the user’s application will\nrenew its refresh token (valid for a new period of three months) every time the user actively\nengages with the application. We believe this justifies a refresh token length for a moderate\nperiod of no shorter than three months rather than a long period of 12 months suggested by\ncommenters. Additionally, as stated above, implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModules are not prohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens for users of the API,\nincluding patients and providers, to align with their institutional policies. Further, implementers\nof § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules are not prohibited from implementing their §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules in accordance with their organizational security\npolicies and posture, including by instituting policies for re-authentication and re-authorization\n(e.g., providers and/or patients could always be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize after\na set number of refresh tokens have been issued). We also note that we have finalized a\nrequirement in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) that a Health IT Module’s authorization server must be able\nto revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction. This required capability will\nenable patients to definitively revoke an application’s authorization to receive their EHI until\nreauthorized, if ever, by the patient.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested creating a more robust assessment process for identity\nmanagement, including adding additional criteria for identity proofing, authentication, and\n\n\n\n\nauthorization, and ensuring software developers do not act in a way that could inhibit patient\ncontrol of their data.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and suggestions. Although we agree that identity\nproofing is an important practice, we did not include requirements for identity proofing in the\nProposed Rule, and have not finalized requirements for identity proofing in response to this\ncomment. We note that the certification criterion finalized in § 170.315(g)(10) only applies to\nhealth IT developers. Given the scope of the Program, we believe that mandating identity\nproofing, which are generally business practices performed by organizations and other entities, is\nnot something appropriate to require of health IT developers. We note that per the requirements\nof the 2015 Edition Privacy and Security Certification Framework, health IT developers with\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(10) are required to certify to §\n170.315(d)(1), which includes requirements for authentication, access control, and authorization.\n\nAdditionally, authentication and authorization for use of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModules are included in the requirements finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(v). We appreciate the\nsentiment expressed by commenters, and have created thorough and rigorous requirements to\nensure adequate privacy and security capabilities are present in § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health\nIT Modules. Regarding the request for certification requirements to ensure that software\ndevelopers do not act in a way that could inhibit patient control of their data, we refer to the\nrequirement finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(A), which requires that patients have the ability to\ngrant applications authorization to access their EHI using granular FHIR Resources of their\nchoice to comply with the adopted implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(3), and\nrequirement in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi), which requires that a Health IT Module’s authorization\nserver must be able to revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that patients be able to specify refresh token\nlength, if desired, and revoke a third-party application’s access at any time. Commenters\nsuggested that clear information be provided to patients whether authorized access is one-time or\nongoing.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Refresh tokens are an OAuth\n2.0 concept, and are largely opaque to the end user. However, we clarify that patients are not\nprohibited from changing the length of refresh tokens to the degree this option is available to\nthem. Additionally, pursuant to these comments, and to ensure patients have the ability to revoke\nan application’s access to their EHI at any time, we have finalized an additional certification\nrequirement in § 170.315(g)(10)(vi) which requires that a Health IT Module’s authorization\nserver must be able to revoke an authorized application’s access at a patient’s direction. We have\nfinalized this as a functional requirement to allow health IT developers the ability to implement it\nin a way that best suits their existing infrastructure and allows for innovative models for\nauthorization revocation to develop. Additionally, per the requirement finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10)(v)(A), Health IT Modules must perform authorization conformant with the\nimplementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3), including all “SMART on FHIR Core\nCapabilities.” The “permission-offline” “SMART on FHIR Core Capability” includes support\nfor the “offline_access” scope. Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in §\n170.215(a)(3) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access”\nscope during authorization. If the “offline_access” scope is not enabled by patients, patients will\nbe required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application’s access to their EHI after the\napplication’s access token expires.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested providing the ability for implementers of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules to perform token introspection using services\n\n\n\n\nenabled by health IT developers to ensure that additional resource servers can work with the\nsame access tokens and authorization policies as the resource servers provided by API\nTechnology Suppliers.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Based on feedback, we have\nfinalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii) that Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification\nmust demonstrate the ability to receive and validate a token issued by its authorization server, but\nwe did not specify a standard for this requirement. Token introspection will allow implementers\nof § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules to use API authorization servers and\nauthorization tokens with various resource servers. This functionality has the potential to reduce\ncomplexity for implementers of § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules authorizing access\nto several resource servers and reduces the overall effort and subsequent use of §\n170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Modules consistent with the goals of section 4002 of the\nCures Act to enable the use of APIs without “special effort.” Although we do not specify a\nstandard for token introspection, we encourage industry to coalesce around using a common\nstandard, like OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662105\n).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concerns with the privacy and security of APIs,\nand nefarious actors posing as legitimate health facilities.\n\n*Response.* Regarding the privacy and security of APIs, the Standardized API for Patient\nand Population Services certification criterion finalized in § 170.315(g)(10) requires Health IT\nModules presented for testing and certification to implement the implementation specification\nadopted in § 170.215(a)(3), which is based on the OAuth 2.0 security standard that is widely\nused in industry. The implementation of OpenID Connect paired with OAuth 2.0 allows health\n105\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662\n\n\n\n\ncare providers to securely deploy and manage APIs consistent with their organizational practices.\n\nHealth care providers retain control over how their workforce and patients authenticate when\ninteracting with the API. For example, a patient may be required to use the same credentials\n(e.g., username and password) they created and use to access their EHI through a patient portal\nas they do when authorizing an application to access their data. Since patients complete the\nauthentication process directly with their health care provider, no application will have access to\ntheir credentials. There is little protection software can provide to protect against nefarious actors\nposing as legitimate health facilities, however, we believe that implementing the security\ncontrols and safeguards described above, along with the privacy and security requirements\nrequired under the 2015 Edition Privacy and Security Certification Framework, will help to\nprotect Health IT Modules against nefarious actors. Additionally, the protections required for\nePHI in Health IT Modules offered by health IT developers acting as business associates of\nhealth care providers remain unchanged.\nvi. Technical Documentation\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7484 in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii) that an API Technology Supplier\nneeded to provide complete documentation via a publicly accessible hyperlink, without\nadditional access requirements, for all aspects of its § 170.315(g)(10)-certified API, especially\nfor any unique technical requirements and configurations, including API syntax, function names,\nrequired and optional parameters supported and their data types, return variables and their\ntypes/structures, exceptions and exception handling methods and their returns, the software\ncomponents and configurations necessary for an application to successfully interact with the API\nand process its response(s), and all applicable technical requirements and attributes necessary for\nan application to be registered with an authorization server. Additionally, we proposed in 84 FR\n7484 to remove the “terms of use” documentation provisions in the API certification criteria\n\n\n\n\nadopted in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(9) in order to reflect the Condition of Certification\nrequirements and not be duplicative of the terms and conditions transparency Condition of\nCertification requirements proposed in 84 FR 7485.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported the requirements for this criterion as\nproposed. Some commenters suggested technical documentation should be limited to\ndescriptions of how the API differs from the utilized standards and implementation\nspecifications, like HL7® FHIR® and the SMART IG.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We did not make substantive\nchanges to the requirements proposed in § 170.315(g)(10)(vii). We have finalized these\nrequirements § 170.315(g)(10)(viii). We recognize that our formal adoption of the HL7 FHIR\nstandard and the associated implementation specifications referenced in § 170.315(g)(10) would\nbe consistent across all Health IT Modules presented for certification. As a result, there may be\nminimal additional documentation needed for these capabilities beyond what is already\ndocumented in adopted standards and implementation specifications. We expect health IT\ndevelopers to disclose any additional data their § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Module\nsupports in the context of the adopted standards and implementation specifications. The content\nof technical documentation required to meet this certification criteria are described in\nrequirements finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(viii)(A). We expect these and any additional\ndocumentation relevant to the use of a health IT developer’s § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModule to be made available via a publicly accessible hyperlink without preconditions or\nadditional steps to meet the requirement as finalized in § 170.315(g)(10)(viii)(B).\nd. API Condition of Certification Requirements\ni. Key Terms\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7477 to adopt new definitions for “API Technology Supplier,”\n\n“API Data Provider,” and “API User” in § 170.102 to describe the stakeholders relevant to our\nproposals.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters recommended updating definitions and\nproviding examples for the key terms, including API User. Most commenters recommended\ndividing “API User” into two categories: “First-Order Users,” to include patients, health care\nproviders, and payers that use apps/services that connect to API technology, and “Third-Party\nUsers,” to include third-party software developers, and developers of software applications used\nby API Data Providers.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We note that in this section we use\nthe terms proposed in § 170.102 that we finalized in § 170.404(c) with added quotation marks for\nemphasis and clarity. We considered separating the term “API User” into distinct terms for\ndevelopers of software applications and other users, such as patients and health care providers.\n\nHowever, we determined that this distinction was unnecessary from a regulatory perspective.\n\nNarrowing our definitions to distinct subgroups could exclude unforeseen stakeholders that\nemerge in a future API ecosystem. The term “API User” was intended to describe stakeholders\nthat interact with the certified API technology either directly (e.g., to develop third-party\napps/services) or indirectly (e.g., as a user of a third-party app/service).\n\nBased on suggestions to revise the proposed key terms, we have renamed the term “API\nData Provider” to “API Information Source” finalized in § 170.404(c) to make clear which party\nis the source and responsible for the EHI (as in “the source of the information is the health care\nprovider”), and “API Technology Supplier” to “Certified API Developer” finalized in §\n170.404(c) to more clearly refer to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to any\nof the API criteria under the Program. Rather than keeping “API technology” an undefined term,\n\n\n\n\nwe renamed it to “certified API technology” and finalized a definition in § 170.404(c).\n\nAdditionally, we amended the definition of “API User” for clarity in § 170.404(c) to “API User\nmeans a person or entity that creates or uses software applications that interact with the ‘certified\nAPI technology’ developed by a ‘Certified API Developer’ and deployed by an ‘API Information\nSource.’” Additionally, we did not include the non-exhaustive list of examples of “API User” in\nthe definition finalized in § 170.404(c). Instead, we rely on preamble to provide guidance for\nexamples of “API Users” rather than appearing to limit the regulatory definition to these\nexamples. We interpret that “API Users” can include, but are not limited to, software developers,\npatients, health care providers, and payers. We simplified the definition of “API Information\nSource” in § 170.404(c) to “API Information Source means an organization that deploys\n‘certified API technology’ created by a ‘Certified API Developer.’” We revised the definition of\n“Certified API Developer” in § 170.404(c) to “Certified API Developer means a health IT\ndeveloper that creates the ‘certified API technology’ that is certified to any of the certification\ncriteria adopted in § 170.315(g)(7) through (10).” We added the definition of “certified API\ntechnology” in § 170.404(c) as “certified API technology means the capabilities of Health IT\nModules that are certified to any of the API-focused certification criteria adopted in §\n170.315(g)(7) through (10).” For ease of reference and to clarify that these terms only apply to\nthe Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we have finalized these revised\ndefinitions in § 170.404(c). In this and other sections of the rule, we use the original proposed\nterms in the proposal and comment summaries, and the finalized terms in our responses.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested ONC allow flexibility for instances where\nstakeholders may meet the definition of more than one key term, and others recommended\nrestricting stakeholders from meeting the definition of more than one key term. Commenters\n\n\n\n\nexpressed concern with the complexity of key terms in the Proposed Rule, and confusion with\nthe interaction of these terms with other criteria within the rule.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for expressing their concern about stakeholders being\nable to serve more than one role under the definitions proposed in § 170.102 that we have\nfinalized in § 170.404(c). We do not believe it is practical to restrict persons or entities to just\none definition. We anticipate situations where a person or entity can serve more than one role.\n\nFor example, a large health care system could purchase and deploy “certified API technology” as\nan “API Information Source” and have “API Users” on staff that create or use software\napplications that interact with the “certified API technology.” Additionally, a health IT developer\ncould serve as a “Certified API Developer” that creates “certified API technology” for testing\nand certification and as an “API User” when it creates software applications that connect to\n“certified API technology.” We clarify that a stakeholder will meet a role defined in § 170.404(c)\nbased on the context in which they are acting. For example, only health IT developers (when\nacting in the context of a “Certified API Developer”) are required to comply with these API\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concern that ONC exceeded its regulatory authority\nby implicating physicians in the definition of “API Data Providers.”\n\n*Response.* We remind commenters that these definitions were created to describe\nrelationships between key API stakeholders and to help describe the Condition and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements. We clarify that health care providers are not covered by the\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements to which the definitions apply in §\n170.404(c) unless they are serving the role of a “Certified API Developer.\nii. Scope and Compliance\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7485 that the Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements proposed in § 170.404 apply to API Technology Suppliers with Health IT Modules\ncertified to any API-focused certification criteria adopted in the proposed § 170.315(g)(7)\nthrough (11).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters agreed that the proposed applicability for the Condition of\nCertification requirements proposed in § 170.404 should be limited to health IT developers\ncertified to any API-focused criteria adopted in the proposed § 170.315(g)(7) through (11). One\ncommenter requested clarification whether non-certified internally developed laboratory systems\nwould be subject to this requirement.\n\n*Response.* We thank stakeholders for their comments. We have generally finalized the\nscope and compliance for the Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements as\nproposed in § 170.404 with one modification. Given that we have not adopted the certification\ncriterion proposed for adoption in § 170.315(g)(11), the scope of the Condition and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements apply only to health IT developers with Health IT Modules\ncertified to any of the API-focused criteria finalized in § 170.315(g)(7) through (10). The\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements finalized in § 170.404 do not apply to\nhealth IT developers not seeking certification, nor do they apply to health IT developers certified\nto solely non-API-focused criteria. Additionally, we clarify that the Condition and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements only apply to practices of Certified API Developers with respect to\nthe capabilities included in § 170.315(g)(7) through (10). In other words, the Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements would not apply to practices of Certified API\nDevelopers with respect to non-certified capabilities or practices associated with, for example,\nthe immunization reporting certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(1), because that criterion is not\none of the API-focused criteria finalized in § 170.315(g)(7) through (10). However, health IT\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers should understand that other requirements in this final rule, especially those related to\ninformation blocking, could still apply to its business practices associated with non-API-focused\ncertification criteria.\niii. General\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7485 in § 170.404(a)(1) to adopt the Cures Act’s API Condition\nof Certification requirement stating that an API Technology Supplier must, through an API,\n“provide access to all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent\npermissible under applicable privacy laws.” We then subsequently proposed in 84 FR 7485 to\ninterpret “all data of a patient’s electronic health record” for the purposes of the scope of this\nAPI Condition of Certification requirement to include the proposed ARCH standard, its\nassociated implementation specifications, and the policy expressed around the data elements that\nmust be supported by § 170.315(g)(10)-certified APIs.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters supported our adoption of the Cures Act’s API Condition of\nCertification requirement. For the purposes of the scope of data covered under this API\nCondition of Certification requirement, most commenters recommended defining “all data\nelements” as the Data Elements referenced by the USCDI and the FHIR resources in the FHIR\nUS Core Implementation Guide STU 3 (US Core IG) for FHIR Release 4. We received\ncomments recommending additional data elements to be included that we discuss in our\ncomment summary for the ARCH in the “API Standards, Implementation Specifications, and\nCertification Criterion” section of this final rule.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate stakeholder feedback. The § 170.315(g)(10) certification\ncriterion requirement and associated standards and implementation specifications will enable\nsecure, standards-based API access to a specific set of information. We have finalized that a\nCertified API Developer must publish APIs, and must allow EHI from such technology to be\n\n\n\n\naccessed, exchanged, and used without special effort through the use of APIs or successor\ntechnology or standards, as provided for under applicable law, including providing access to all\ndata elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable\nprivacy laws, in § 170.404(a)(1). Additionally, for the purposes of meeting this portion of the\nCures Act's API Condition of Certification requirement, we clarify the data required and that\nmust be supported to demonstrate conformance to the final § 170.315(g)(10) certification\ncriterion (including all of its associated standards and implementation specifications) constitutes\n“all data elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent permissible under\napplicable privacy laws.” Regarding the recommendation by commenters that the scope of “all\ndata elements” include the Data Elements of the standard adopted in § 170.213 and FHIR\nresources referenced by the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(2), we note\nthat both the standard and implementation specification are included in the interpretation of “all\ndata elements of a patient’s electronic health record to the extent permissible under applicable\nprivacy laws” above. We note that this specific interpretation does not extend beyond the API\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements finalized in § 170.404 and cannot be\ninferred to reduce the scope or applicability of other Cures Act Conditions of Certification or the\ninformation blocking policies, which include a larger scope of data.\niv. Transparency Conditions\nWe proposed in 85 FR 7485 and7486 in § 170.404(a)(2)(i) to require API Technology\nSuppliers make available complete business and technical documentation via a publicly\naccessible hyperlink, including all terms and conditions for use of its API technology.\n\nAdditionally, we proposed that API Technology Suppliers must make clear to the public the\ntiming information applicable to their disclosures in order to prevent discrepancies between an\nAPI Technology Supplier’s public documentation and its direct communication to customers.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we requested comment at 84 FR 7486 on whether the expectation for API\nTechnology Suppliers to make necessary changes to transparency documentation should be\nfinalized in regulation text, or whether this would be standard practice as part of making this\ndocumentation available.\n\n*Comments.* We received overall support from commenters for the need to make complete\nbusiness and technical documentation available via a publicly accessible hyperlink. We did not\nreceive public comment on whether we should formally include public disclosure requirements\nfor regular updates to business and technical documentation in regulatory text.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support to make complete business and\ntechnical documentation available via a publicly accessible hyperlink. We have finalized in §\n170.404(a)(2)(i) that a Certified API Developer must publish complete business and technical\ndocumentation, including the documentation described in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii), via a publicly\naccessible hyperlink that allows any person to directly access the information without any\npreconditions or additional steps. We made small adjustments to § 170.404(a)(2)(i) to reflect the\nchanges in API definitions finalized in § 170.404(c).\n\nGiven that we did not receive public comment on whether we should formally include\npublic disclosure requirements for regular updates to business and technical documentation in\nregulatory text, so we have finalized in 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(B) that a Certified API Developer must\nprovide notice and a reasonable opportunity for API Information Sources and API Users to\nupdate their applications to preserve compatibility with certified API technology and to comply\nwith applicable terms and conditions. We note that notice could include a public notice made\navailable on a website, but also encourage Certified API Developers to contact API Information\nSource customers and registered API Users (application developers) directly prior to updating\nbusiness and technical documentation.\n\n\n\n\n(A) Terms and Conditions\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7485 in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A) that API Technology Suppliers\nmust publish all terms and conditions for its API technology, including any restrictions,\nlimitations, obligations, registration process requirements, or other similar requirements that\nwould be needed to: develop software applications to interact with the API technology;\ndistribute, deploy, and enable the use of software applications in production environments that\nuse the API technology; use software applications, including to access, exchange, and use EHI\nby means of the API technology; use any EHI obtained by means of the API technology; and\nregister software applications. Additionally, we proposed in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) that any and\nall fees charged by an API Technology Supplier for the use of its API technology must be\ndescribed in detailed, plain language, including the persons or classes of persons to whom the fee\napplies; the circumstances in which the fee applies; and the amount of the fee, which for\nvariable fees must include the specific variable(s) and methodology(ies) that will be used to\ncalculate the fee.\n\n*Comments.* We received support from stakeholders regarding the transparency of “all\nterms and conditions” associated with the use of API technology.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. We believe this terms and conditions\ntransparency requirement would ensure that API Information Sources and API Users do not\nexperience “special effort” in the form of unnecessary costs or delays in obtaining the terms and\nconditions for certified API technology. Furthermore, we believe full transparency is necessary\nto ensure that API Users have a thorough understanding in advance of any terms or conditions\nthat might apply to them once they have committed to developing software that interacts with\ncertified API technology. We have finalized in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A) that Certified API\nDevelopers must publish all terms and conditions for its certified API technology, including any\n\n\n\n\nfees, restrictions, limitations, obligations, registration process requirements or other similar\nrequirements as enumerated in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(1) through (6). We made small\nadjustments to § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A) to reflect the changes in API definitions finalized in §\n170.404(c). Additionally, we moved “App developer verification” from its proposed location in\n§ 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C) and finalized it in § 170.404(b)(1) to improve organization. We added the\nphrase “Used to verify the authenticity of API Users” to the regulation text finalized in §\n170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(5) for consistency with our proposed policy. We also moved the phrase\n“Register software applications” from its proposed location in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(5) to the\nfinalized location in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(6) and revised the phrase for consistency.\n\nAdditionally, we made small changes to the regulation text finalized in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(1)\nthrough § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(A)(6) for clarity.\n\n*Comments.* We received both support and disagreement for the requirement to publish\ntransparency documentation on API fees. Some commenters felt transparency documentation of\nAPI fees should be limited to value-added services, because those are the only permitted fees\napplicable to API Users, and the other permitted fees applicable to API Data Providers (usage-\nbased fees and fees to recover costs for development, deployment, and upgrades) would be\nincluded in contractual documentation with their customers.\n\n*Response.* We recognize that some commenters had concern with making documentation\non permitted fees publicly available. We believe that transparent documentation of all permitted\nfees is necessary to maintain a competitive marketplace and ensure that fees are reasonably\nrelated to the development, deployment, upgrade, and use of certified API technology. Fee\ntransparency will also enable API Information Sources and API Users to shop for certified API\ntechnology and related services that meet their needs. We have finalized in §\n170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) that any and all fees charged by a Certified API Developer for the use of its\n\n\n\n\ncertified API technology must be described in detailed, plain language, including all material\ninformation described in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B)(1) through (3). Additionally, we made small\nadjustments to § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) to reflect the changes in API definitions finalized in §\n170.404(c).\n\n*Comments.* Multiple stakeholders expressed the need to include consumer protections in\nthe terms and conditions documentation with an explanation about how EHI will be used.\n\n*Response.* This provision of the Condition of Certification requirements does not prohibit\nadditional content or limit the type of content a Certified API Developer may include in its terms\nand conditions. A Certified API Developer would be permitted to include consumer protections\nin their terms and conditions documentation. Additionally, we clarify these API Conditions of\nCertification requirements only apply to Certified API Developers. As such, API Information\nSources and API Users are not required by the API Condition of Certification requirements to\npublish any terms and conditions, including those that apply to consumer protections.\nv. Fees Conditions\n(A) General Fees Prohibition\nWe proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A) that API Technology Suppliers would be\nprohibited from imposing fees associated with API technology as a Condition of Certification\nrequirement. In establishing this general prohibition, ONC was mindful of the need for API\nTechnology Suppliers to recover their costs and to earn a reasonable return on their investments\nin providing API technology that has been certified under the Program. Accordingly, we\nidentified categories of “permitted fees” in 84 FR 7487 that API Technology Suppliers would be\npermitted to charge and still be compliant with the Condition of Certification and Program\nrequirements. These include the proposed § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) (permitted fee for developing,\ndeploying, and upgrading API technology), proposed § 170.404(a)(3)(iii) (permitted fee to\n\n\n\n\nrecover costs of supporting API usage for purposes other than patient access), and proposed §\n170.404(a)(3)(iv) (permitted fee for value-added services). We also proposed in 84 FR 7487 that\nAPI Technology Suppliers would not be permitted to impose fees on any person in connection\nwith an API Technology Supplier's work to support the use of API technology to facilitate a\npatient's ability to access, exchange, or use their EHI. We also clarified that while the proposed\npermitted fees set the boundaries for the fees API Technology Suppliers would be permitted to\ncharge and to whom those permitted fees could be charged, the proposed regulations did not\nspecify who could pay the API Technology Supplier's permitted fee. Rather, we proposed\ngeneral conditions that an API Technology Supplier’s permitted fees must satisfy in §\n170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1) through (4), and requested comment in 84 FR 7488 on these conditions\nand whether they sufficiently restrict fees from being used to prevent access, exchange, and use\nof EHI through APIs without special effort. We include detailed discussions of permitted fees\nand related conditions below.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters supported the clear prohibition on API fees outside those\nfees permitted in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) through (iv), expressing that the language in the rule would\nprevent confusion regarding allowable and restricted fees. Some commenters noted that\nprohibiting fees would enable patients to exercise their HIPAA right of access without\nexperiencing cost barriers, and remove cost barriers to hospitals and health care facilities using\nAPIs for interoperability. Commenters noted that the proposals addressed many of the access and\npricing practices that API Technology Suppliers engaged in to limit data exchange and gain a\ncompetitive advantage. Commenters noted that API Technology Supplier pricing practices often\ncreate barriers to entry and competition for apps that health care providers seek to use. Some\ncommenters supported the proposal that prohibits API Technology Suppliers from charging fees\nto API Users.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank stakeholders for their support of and feedback on our proposal. We\nhave finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A) that all fees related to certified API technology not\notherwise permitted by § 170.404(a)(3) are prohibited from being imposed by a Certified API\nDeveloper. Additionally, we have modified and reorganized these Condition of Certification\nrequirements for clarity. We have renamed the title for the section from the Proposed Rule to\n“Fees conditions” because the requirements include both permitted and prohibited fees. We have\nupdated the terminology used in this section to reflect changes made to the terminology used\nthroughout the API Condition of Certification requirements and finalized in § 170.404(c). We\nfinalized a requirement in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A) that permitted fees in paragraphs §\n170.404(a)(3)(ii) and § 170.404(a)(3)(iv) may include fees that result in a reasonable profit\nmargin in accordance with the information blocking Costs Exception provision finalized in §\n170.302. We clarify that any fee that is not covered by those exceptions would be suspect under\nthe information blocking provision, and would equally not be permitted by this API Condition of\nCertification requirement.\n\nThis general prohibition on fees as finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A) is meant to ensure\nthat Certified API Developers do not engage in pricing practices that create barriers to entry and\ncompetition for apps and API-based services that health care providers seek to use. Such\nactivities are inconsistent with the goal of enabling API-based access, exchange, and use of EHI\nby patients and other stakeholders without special effort. As finalized, this general prohibition\nallows for three categories of permitted fees (§ 170.404(a)(3)(ii) through (iv)) to allow Certified\nAPI Developers to recover their costs and to earn a reasonable return on their investments in\nproviding certified API technology while being compliant with the Condition of Certification\nand Program requirements.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters were critical of our proposals, expressing concerns that the\nproposed policies may stifle relationships between API Technology Suppliers and application\ndevelopers. Others expressed concern that the proposed fee structure would place undue burden\non API Data Providers, and that ONC should instead consider regulations that allow fee sharing\nacross stakeholders. Some commenters stated that ONC should remove all prohibitions, and\nallow for market pricing and revenue sharing.\n\nSeveral commenters, many of whom were providers and provider organizations,\nrequested additional clarity and guidance regarding the API fees that can be charged under the\nCondition of Certification requirements. Some commenters requested clarification regarding\nwhether an API Data Provider can transfer costs to API Users. Other commenters requested\nclarification regarding when it is (and is not) appropriate for an API User to be charged a fee in\nconnection with use of API technology. A few commenters requested that ONC provide a chart\nthat lists all actors, all types of costs, and who can charge whom.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this feedback from commenters. These “general conditions,” as\nfinalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i) and discussed above, will facilitate API-based access, exchange,\nand use of EHI by patients and other stakeholders without special effort. We disagree with\ncommenters that the permitted fee policies will stifle relationships between Certified API\nDevelopers and API Users. Cumulatively, these final policies create guardrails to protect against\nanti-competitive practices and reinforce the independence that we believe API Information\nSources should have to establish relationships with API Users. Furthermore, we believe these fee\npolicies are necessary in light of the potential for Certified API Developers to use their market\nposition and control over certified API technology to engage in discriminatory practices that\ncreate special effort and barriers to the use of certified API technology. We continue to receive\nevidence that some Certified API Developers are engaging in practices that create special effort\n\n\n\n\nfor the use of certified API technology. These practices include fees that create barriers to entry\nor competition as well as rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors. For example, we have\nreceived feedback that some Certified API Developers are conditioning access to technical\ndocumentation on revenue sharing or royalty agreements that bear no plausible relation to the\ncosts incurred by the Certified API Developer to provide or enable the use of certified API\ntechnology. We are also aware of discriminatory pricing policies that have the purpose or effect\nof excluding competitors from the use of APIs and other interoperability elements despite the\nfact that the API Information Source would like to partner with and use these competitive, best-\nof-breed services. These practices from Certified API Developers close off the market to\ninnovative applications and services that could empower patients and enable providers to deliver\ngreater value and choice to health care consumers and other service providers.\n\nWe note that Certified API Developers and API Users have the ability to collaborate and\nform relationships, so long as these relationships do not conflict with any of the provisions of\nthis final rule or other applicable Federal and State laws and regulations. Further, we clarify that\nwhile the permitted fees set the boundaries for the fees Certified API Developers are permitted to\ncharge and to whom those permitted fees can be charged, they do not prohibit who may pay the\nCertified API Developer’s permitted fee. In other words, these conditions limit the party from\nwhich a Certified API Developer may require payment, but they do not speak to who may pay\nthe fee. For example, a permitted practice under these conditions could include a relationship or\nagreement where an API User or other party offered to pay the fee owed by the API Information\nSource to a Certified API Developer. This is an acceptable practice because the fee is first agreed\nupon between the Certified API Developer and API Information Source and subsequently paid\nby the API Information Source directly or by a third party on behalf of the API Information\nSource. We note that fees charged for “value-added services” can arise between an API\n\n\n\n\nInformation Source and Certified API Developer or API User. As a general matter, we note that\nstakeholders should be mindful of other Federal and State laws and regulations that could\nprohibit or limit certain types of relationships involving remuneration.\n\nWe provide additional clarity and guidance regarding the API fees that can be charged\nunder the Condition of Certification requirements in the sections that follow. Additionally, we\nappreciate commenters’ requests for clarification, including a chart of actors and costs. We will\ntake this comment into consideration as we develop educational materials to help explain the\npermitted fees conditions finalized in § 170.404(a)(3).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested that one way to clarify the limits on API fees would\nbe to require API Technology Suppliers provide fee information to ONC and for ONC to make\nthis information publicly available, including information on individual pricing transactions.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the recommendation from commenters to require Certified API\nDevelopers to provide fee information to ONC. We view fee transparency as a responsibility that\na Certified API Developer can fulfill without having to send a listing of its API fees to ONC. We\nhave finalized the provision in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii) that a Certified API Developer must publish\nall terms and conditions for its certified API technology, including any fees. Specifically, we\nhave finalized in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) that any and all fees charged by a Certified API\nDeveloper for the use of its certified API technology must be described in detailed plain\nlanguage, including the persons or classes of persons to whom the fee applies; the circumstances\nin which the fee applies; and the amount of the fee, which for variable fees must include the\nspecific variable(s) and methodology(ies) that will be used to calculate the fee.\n\n(B) Certified API Developer Permitted Fees Conditions\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed general conditions in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1) through (4) that an API\nTechnology Supplier’s permitted fees must satisfy in order for such fees to be expressly\npermitted.\n\n*Comments.* We received support for the general conditions for permitted fees from\ncommenters. Some commenters expressed appreciation for the guardrails and transparency of the\npermitted fees. Under the first condition, commenters sought clarity on the nature and extent of\nsome of the permissible fees an API Technology Supplier can charge and how to model such\nfees, specifically regarding the “objective and verifiable” criteria. Another commenter supported\nthe second condition that fees must be reasonably related to API Technology Supplier’s costs of\nsupplying and, if applicable, supporting the API technology to the API Data Provider, especially\nin situations where physicians may also develop APIs or support apps.\n\nHowever, some commenters expressed concern with the third condition to reasonably\nallocate fees across all customers of the API. Commenters explained that fees could not be\nreasonably allocated across all customers of the API, because the number of customers will\nchange over time. We received no comments on the fourth condition that API Technology\nSuppliers must ensure that fees are not based on whether the requestor or other person is a\ncompetitor who will be using the API technology in a way that facilitates competition. In\naddition to the general permitted fees proposed, some commenters recommended clear fee\nexemption for any health information provided or reported by a practice for the purpose of\nmeeting reporting requirements.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate feedback from commenters. We have finalized these general\nconditions for permitted fees in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B) with some modifications as described\nfurther below. We have finalized that for all permitted fees, a Certified API Developer must: (1)\nEnsure that such fees are based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to\n\n\n\n\nall similarly situated API Information Sources and API Users; (2) Ensure that such fees imposed\non API Information Sources are reasonably related to the Certified API Developer’s costs of\nsupplying certified API technology to, and if applicable, support certified API technology for,\nAPI Information Sources; (3) Ensure that such fees for supplying, and if applicable, supporting\ncertified API technology are reasonably allocated among all similarly situated API Information\nSources; and (4) Ensure that such fees are not based on whether API Information Sources or API\nUsers are competitors, potential competitors, or will be using the certified API technology in a\nway that facilitates competition with the Certified API Developer. We have revised the term\n“substantially similar” to “similarly situated” in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1) for clarity and to align\nwith changes made in § 171.302. Additionally, in response to comments and to align with\nchanges made in § 171.302 and § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1), we have revised the term “substantially\nsimilar” to “similarly situated” in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(3). We emphasize that this provision is\nmeant to prevent one customer or a specific group of customers to whom the certified API\ntechnology is supplied or for whom it is supported from bearing an unreasonably high cost\ncompared to other customers, which could lead to “special effort” for accessing and using APIs.\n\nWe believe the final policy achieves the same goal as proposed and provides clearer guidelines\nfor the regulated community to follow. Additionally, we have revised the phrase “classes of\npersons and requests” to “API Information Sources and API Users” in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1)\nto clearly express the actors being charged fees by Certified API Developers. Additionally, we\nhave revised the sentence structure and grammar in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(2) through (4) for\nsimplification.\n\nIn response to comments requesting clarity on the nature and extent of permissible fees a\nCertified API Developer can charge and how a Certified API Developer should model such fees,\nspecifically regarding the “objective and verifiable” requirement finalized in\n\n\n\n\n§ 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1), we emphasize that there will be significant variability in the fee models\nand specific fees charged by each Certified API Developer. Our goal with the requirement that\nfees be “objective and verifiable” is to require Certified API Developers to apply fee criteria that,\namong other things, will lead the Certified API Developer to come to the same conclusion with\nrespect to the permitted fee’s amount each time it administers a fee to an API Information Source\nor API User. Accordingly, the fee cannot be based on the Certified API Developer’s subjective\njudgment or discretion.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters suggested that ONC allow API Data Providers the ability\nto recoup the costs for upgrading technology.\n\n*Response.* This comment appears to misunderstand the scope and applicability of ONC’s\nauthority with respect to these Condition of Certification requirements. We clarify that these\nCondition of Certification requirements apply only to Certified API Developers. We note that\nsimilar to any IT investment, API Information Sources (as “health care providers”) would\ngenerally be expected to recover these costs through fees administered while delivering health\ncare services. Additionally, if an API Information Source were to recoup such costs they would\nneed to do so consistent with the information blocking exceptions and other applicable laws and\nregulations.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters requested that ONC conduct evaluations after the\nimplementation of the rule and use the results to drive future policy. Some commenters\nrecommended a study to evaluate the real-world cost of APIs used by health systems in areas\nsuch as clinical decision support, payments, machine learning, and precision medicine.\n\nCommenters also suggested ONC conduct a study on whether these regulations improve patient\naccess to their EHI.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the evaluation recommendations. We will consider these\nsuggestions as we implement and administer the Program.\n\n(C) Certified API Developer Prohibited Fees\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7595 in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B) that permitted fees would not\ninclude costs associated with intangible assets (including depreciation or loss of value), except\nthe actual development or acquisition costs of such assets. Additionally, we proposed in\n§ 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(C) that permitted fees would not include opportunity costs, except for the\nreasonable forward-looking cost of capital.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to the proposal for costs associated\nwith intangible assets other than actual development or acquisition costs of such assets.\n\n*Response.* We moved the proposed § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) to the general\nconditions for permitted fees finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(C)(1) and (2), respectively, because\nthey are general conditions on permitted fees rather than conditions for “Recovering API usage\ncosts.” We did not make other changes to the proposed regulation text in these two sections other\nthan updating terms to the finalized definitions in § 170.404(c).\n\nAdditionally, in the discussion of the Fees Exception in this final rule (VIII.D.2.b), we\ndiscussed that one commenter expressed concern that the overlap between the Fees Exception\nand the Licensing Exception creates the potential for actors to recover the same costs twice. The\ncommenter explained that licensing of IP is intended to recoup the costs of development of that\nIP, so where the IP is an interoperability element, the costs reasonably incurred for its\ndevelopment should be incorporated into the royalty rate. The commenter recommended that we\nbe clearer that, in these circumstances, only a single recovery is permitted. In order to address\nthis comment and align the API permitted fees with related provisions finalized in the Fees\nException (§ 170.302(a)(2)(vi)) and Licensing Exception (§ 170.303(b)(2)(iv)), we have added\n\n\n\n\nand finalized § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(C)(3), which states that the permitted fees in this section cannot\ninclude any costs that that led to the creation of IP if the actor charged a royalty for that IP\npursuant to § 170.303 and that royalty included the development costs for the creation of the IP.\n\nWe refer readers to the “Basis for Fees Condition” sub-section within section VIII.D.2.b for a\nmore detailed discussion of the rationale for this addition.\n\n(i) General Examples of Prohibited Fees\nAs discussed in the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7481 and finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A),\nany API-related fee imposed by a Certified API Developer that is not expressly permitted is\nprohibited. In the Proposed Rule, we provided the following non-exhaustive examples of fees for\nservices that Certified API Developers would be prohibited from charging, and reiterate them\nhere in the final rule for clarity:\n(1) Any fee for access to the documentation that a Certified API Developer is required to\npublish or make available under this Condition of Certification requirement.\n\n(2) Any fee for access to other types of documentation or information that a software\ndeveloper may reasonably require to make effective use of certified API technology for any\nlegally permissible purpose.\n\n(3) Any fee in connection with any services that would be essential to a developer or\nother person’s ability to develop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that\nuse certified API technology. These services could include, for example, access to “test\nenvironments” and other resources that an application developer would need to efficiently design\nand develop apps. The services could also include access to distribution channels if they are\nnecessary to deploy production-ready software and to production resources, such as the\ninformation needed to connect to certified API technology (e.g., service base URLs) or the\nability to dynamically register with an authorization server.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* At least one commenter expressed concern about the open-ended nature of\nthe examples of prohibited fees we provided in the Proposed Rule. In particular, that any fee in\nconnection with any services that would be essential to a developer or other person’s ability to\ndevelop and commercially distribute production-ready applications that use API technology\nwould be prohibited. They stated that if the example were not more clearly defined and scoped, it\ncould be used by API Users to create requirements for API Technology Suppliers beyond what\nwould normally be considered necessary to successfully deploy apps in production. They\nrequested ONC more clearly define “essential services” in final rulemaking or withdraw the\nreference.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We disagree with commenters\nthat the examples are too broad. We believe that in some cases they need to be general because\nof the diverse and varied practices that could be used by Certified API Developers to create\nspecial effort to use certified API technology. While we understand that the generality of the\nexample regarding “essential services” may at first appear difficult for Certified API Developers\nto follow and, per the commenter, could be creatively used by an API User to request more\nsupport than necessary, we offer the following as additional guidance: A Certified API\nDeveloper is best positioned to know what an API User, for example, needs to have access to\nand do programmatically in order for the API User’s application to be developed and\ncommercially distributed as production-ready for use with certified API technology. From a\nCertified API Developer’s perspective, if that requires any number of mandatory steps (e.g.,\npassing tests in sandbox/test environment, conducting a demo, submitting documentation or\npaperwork) in order for the application to be production-ready for use with certified API\ntechnology, then fees associated with those mandatory steps are prohibited. Conversely, fees for\nrequirements beyond what a Certified API Developer considers necessary to successfully deploy\n\n\n\n\napplications in production are considered supplemental to the development, testing, and\ndeployment of software applications that interact with certified API technology, and are\npermitted fees for value added services as finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(iv).\n\n(D) Record-Keeping Requirements\nWe proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(v) that API Technology Suppliers must keep for\ninspection detailed records of all API technology fees charged, all costs incurred to provide API\ntechnology to API Data Providers, methodologies used to calculate such fees, and the specific\ncosts to which such fees are attributed. We requested comment in 84 FR 7492 on whether these\nrequirements provide adequate traceability and accountability for costs permitted under this API\nCondition of Certification and whether to require more detailed accounting records or prescribe\nspecific accounting standards.\n\n*Comments.* A majority of commenters expressed concerns with the level of granularity\nproposed for record keeping in § 170.404(a)(3)(v). These commenters stated that the required\nrecordkeeping would exceed documentation performed for any other purpose. Some commenters\nstated that the requirement for health IT developers to track who pays fees and how fees enter the\nsystem will cause significant administrative burden, especially on smaller vendors or vendors\nwith business models that require less operational overhead. Additionally, they stated that the\nrequirement for clients to maintain and potentially publicly disclose records of fees for\ninspection would place a burden on IT providers, and could potentially allow bigger companies\nto engage in practices such as predatory pricing. Commenters suggested ONC have a more\nscaled-back method, and simply allow patients the ability to access their EHI without charge.\n\nThese commenters recommended focusing on a good conduct approach rather than prescriptive\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback and perspective. We moved §\n170.404(a)(3)(v) to 170.404(a)(3)(i)(D) for better organization because this provision applies to\nthe permitted fee Condition of Certification requirements finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) through\n(iii). We have finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(D) that Certified API Developers must keep\ndetailed records for inspection of all fees charged, all costs incurred to provide certified API\ntechnology to API Information Sources, methodologies used to calculate such fees, and the\nspecific costs to which fees are attributed. Considering the feedback on perceived burden, we\nbelieve transparency and documentation of API fees is necessary to mitigate unfair pricing\npractices that may stifle innovation or otherwise create barriers to the goals of enabling API-\nbased access, exchange, and use of EHI without special effort. Further, we believe that the\naccounting practices already used by health IT developers will largely support the health IT\ndeveloper to meet this requirement. Examples of these practices by health IT developers include\nthe methods used to track their own investments, determine how to bill and issue invoices to\ntheir customers, document receipt of payment, and to maintain overall accurate financial records\nof business transactions. We find it difficult to believe, as some commenters appeared to\nindicate, that health IT developers are not already keeping such financial records and that this\nrequirement would create substantial new documentation burden for Certified API Developers.\n\nThe record-keeping requirements finalized in 170.404(a)(3)(i)(D) foster transparency and\npromote accountability in the Program. In response to the comments received, we have not added\nadditional requirements for accounting records or standards.\n\n(E) Permitted Fee for Development, Deployment, and Upgrades\nWe proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) to permit an API Technology Supplier to charge API\nData Providers reasonable fees for developing, deploying, and upgrading Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(11).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters applauded the permitted fee related to development,\ndeployment, and upgrading API technology. The majority supported the proposal that fees would\nnot be permitted if they interfere with an API User’s ability to efficiently and effectively develop\nand deploy production-ready software. A few commenters expressed concern that our proposals\nregarding development, deployment, and upgrade fees were not restrictive enough. Commenters\nnoted that API Technology Suppliers will use the allowable fees, such as for program upgrades,\nas a barrier to providing interoperability between systems or other applications and a means to\neliminate competitive threats. Some of these commenters recommended that ONC explicitly\nprohibit API Technology Suppliers from charging any fees for implementing APIs and for\nfacilitating the interoperable exchange of EHI and that this blanket prohibition apply to all new\nand updated API technology. A few commenters noted that it is possible that API Technology\nSuppliers will bundle or upcharge service fees to recoup API technology development costs and\nAPI Technology Suppliers should not be allowed to charge costs for development or impose\nsurcharges for product feature development. They noted that product feature development should\nbe considered a cost of doing business and can be amortized as a one-time capital expense across\nthe vendor’s entire customer base without the need for recovering costs from API Users. They\nemphasized that API access and use prices need to be transparent as the intent of Congress was\nto have APIs be made easily available and at no or low cost, not to be a source of revenue for\nprofit. Other commenters noted that the development of the APIs themselves should be regarded\nas part of the license fee and the API Technology Suppliers should not be permitted to charge an\nadditional license fee to either the API Data Provider or API User for what is an inherent part of\nthe software. Another commenter requested that consideration be applied toward potential\nadditional hidden integration fees.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support, concerns, and recommendations from commenters.\n\nWe finalized this proposal in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) as proposed with updated terms based on the\nrevised finalized definitions in § 170.404(c). We refer to the discussions below and 84 FR 7488\nfor additional details on what Certified API Developer fees for “developing,” “deploying,” and\n“upgrading” certified API technology comprise. We also note that the nature of the costs charged\nunder this category of permitted fees depends on the scope of the work to be undertaken by a\nCertified API Developer (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires\nof the Certified API Developer to deploy and upgrade the certified API technology).\n\nWe sincerely thank commenters for the various recommendations to prohibit or restrict\nfees regarding certified API technology. In order to reconcile the recommendations specific to §\n170.404(a)(3)(ii) and other conditions in this final rule, we have aligned related conditions to\naddress concerns and mitigate potential fee practices that could limit API-based access,\nexchange, and use of EHI by patients and other stakeholders without special effort. As finalized,\nwe believe the fees permitted in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) and § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B), transparency\nrequirements in § 170.404(a)(2), and openness and pro-competitive conditions in § 170.404(a)(4)\nwill ensure that fees permitted for upgrade costs will not be used as a barrier to providing\ninteroperability between systems or other applications, or as a means to eliminate competitive\nthreats. Additionally, the transparency requirements regarding the publication of fees finalized in\n§ 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B) will help prevent hidden integration fees cited by commenters.\n\nWe thank commenters for recommending and noting that development of the APIs\nthemselves should be regarded as part of a license fee and that Certified API Developers should\nnot be permitted to charge an additional license fee for what is an inherent part of the software.\n\nIn response to this recommendation, we have added a provision in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(C)(3) that\nstates that permitted fees in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) through (iv) may not include any costs that led to\n\n\n\n\nthe creation of IP, if the actor charged a royalty for that IP pursuant to the information blocking\nLicensing Exception (§ 171.303). This provision aligns with similar provisions included in the\ninformation blocking section and will ensure that Certified API Developers cannot earn a double\nrecovery in instances described by the commenter.\n\nWe will continue to work with stakeholders to advance policies that promote\ninteroperability and deter practices that may stifle innovation or present barriers to the access,\nexchange, and use of EHI through APIs. Subject to the general conditions in § 170.404(a)(3)(i),\nour final policies support the ability of Certified API Developers to recover the full range of\nreasonable costs associated with developing, deploying, and upgrading API technology over\ntime. It is important that Certified API Developers be able to recover these costs and earn a\nreasonable return on their investments so that they have adequate incentives to make continued\ninvestments in these technologies. In particular, we anticipate Certified API Developers will\nneed to continually expand the data elements and upgrade the capabilities associated with\ncertified APIs as the USCDI and HL7® FHIR® standard and associated implementation\nspecifications mature. We refer readers to the information blocking section of this preamble\n(VIII) for additional information on activities that may constitute information blocking and for\ndiscussion about how the fees provisions in this Condition of Certification and within the\ninformation blocking section support innovation.\n\n*Comments.* Some developers expressed concern regarding balancing and distributing\ncosts with regard to the permitted fee for developing, deploying, and upgrading technology. The\ncommenters noted ONC proposed that the cost for development be distributed among those who\nwill use it, which they felt was problematic in many ways, but most fundamentally because it\nsuggests a serious misconception about how software development is funded, priced, and sold.\n\nThe commenters emphasized that requiring development costs to be divided among clients\n\n\n\n\npurchasing the API necessitates new and complex business processes and creates unsolvable\nscenarios that could easily create business conflicts between API Technology Suppliers and their\nclients. At least one commenter suggested that ONC should consider balancing the costs\nassociated with API development and deployment across both API Data Providers and certain\nAPI Users to ensure that third-party software application developers also bear some of the\nfinancial burden, since they stand to generate revenue from the use of their apps. Commenters\nasked ONC clarify why it believes it is inappropriate to pass development, deployment, and\nupgrade costs on to API Users. Other commenters noted that the costs for updating information\nsystems and Health IT Modules to the new standards and requirements should not be passed on\nto physicians and patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We proposed and finalized this\npermitted fee for development, deployment, and upgrade costs because we believe that these\ncosts should be negotiated solely between the Certified API Developer that supplies the\ncapabilities and the API Information Source that implements them in their production\nenvironment. In our view, it is inappropriate for Certified API Developers to go around the API\nInformation Source to directly impose financial cost burdens on API Users for the benefit of\nworking with or connecting to the API Information Source. Based on our experience, the practice\nof a Certified API Developer going around its customer (the API Information Source) to also\ncharge API Users erodes an API Information Source’s choice and the independence of their\nrelationship with API Users. As such, that kind of business practice would be something that we\nwould consider creating special effort on the part of the API Users if they had to continue to face\nadditional fees just for permission to work with or connect to an API Information Source’s\ncertified API technology.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the development, deployment, and upgrade permitted fee is limited between the\nCertified API Developer and API Information Source as a way to recoup a Certified API\nDeveloper’s costs to supply certified API technology to a particular API Information Source, we\nagain reiterate that the value added services permitted fee providers Certified API Developers a\nwide range of options to make additional revenue related to their certified API technology.\n\nShould API Users stand to generate revenue from the use of their apps, any fee an API\nInformation Source may impose would not be in scope for this Condition of Certification but\nwould be likely be covered by information blocking. Accordingly, we emphasize that such\nstakeholders should take care to ensure they are compliant with other Federal and State laws and\nregulations that may prohibit or limit certain types of relationships involving remuneration.\n\nIn response to comments suggesting that costs for updating information systems and\nHealth IT Modules to the new standards and requirements would be passed on to physicians and\npatients, we disagree. We emphasize that most of the information contained in a patient's\nelectronic record has been documented during the practice of medicine or has otherwise been\ncaptured in the course of providing health care services to patients. In our view, patients have\neffectively paid for this information, either directly or through their employers, health plans, and\nother entities that negotiate and purchase health care items and services on their behalf, and\nshould be able to access the information via certified API technology without fees.\n\n*Comments.* Some developers suggested that API Technology Suppliers should be able to\ncharge fees for access to a test environment and requested clarification as to whether an API\nTechnology Supplier can charge for the use of sandboxes by API Users.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. As detailed in the “General\nExamples of Prohibited Fees” section of the preamble text and included in the general\nprohibition finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A), Certified API Developers are prohibited from\n\n\n\n\ncharging fees in connection with any services essential to a developer or other person’s ability to\ndevelop and commercially distribute production-ready applications for use with certified API\ntechnology. In general, if a test environment or sandbox is required to be used by a Certified API\nDeveloper and is essential for an application to be developed in order to be considered\nproduction-ready by the Certified API Developer for use with its certified API technology, then\nfees associated with that kind of test environment would be prohibited as they would impose\nspecial effort. However, we note that this prohibition is not globally applicable. If instead, the\npurpose of the testing environment was to provide specific testing above-and-beyond production-\nreadiness for use with certified API technology, then fees could be charged for such testing as\npart of the value-added services permitted fee.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested guidance on how ONC expects API Technology\nSuppliers to account for the costs incurred to develop, deploy, and upgrade the API technology,\nwhich is part of, and not necessarily separable from, the broader EHR product. Several\ncommenters opposed the prohibition against charging for work to upgrade the broader EHR\nproduct, expressing that this is essential work needed to modernize their solutions as broader\ntechnologies evolve. One commenter noted that the Proposed Rule does not set specific\nguidelines on what constitutes an upgrade or how much the fee could be, and it is the\ncommenter’s experience that EHR systems often charge fees for such services as integrating with\na clinical data registry or using outside or non-preferred software.\n\n*Response.* We thank stakeholders for their comments. While we understand that there is\noverlap between features of the certified API technology and the “broader EHR product,” we\nrefer specifically to development, deployment, and upgrades made to “certified API technology”\nas defined in § 170.404(c). Namely, development, deployment, and upgrades made to the\ncapabilities of certified Health IT Modules that fulfill the API-focused certification criteria\n\n\n\n\nadopted at § 170.315(g)(7) through (10). In response to commenters concerned that EHR\ndevelopers often charge fees for services such as integrating with a clinical data registry or using\noutside or non-preferred software, we note that, as described in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(A), Certified\nAPI Developers are prohibited from imposing fees associated with certified API technology\nunless included as a permitted fee in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii) through (iv). We do not include specific\nprice information for permitted fees to develop, deploy, or upgrade API technology, because\nthese costs are subject to change over time with new technology and varying development,\ndeployment, and upgrade efforts. Instead, we allow Certified API Developers to recover their\ncosts (including costs that result in a reasonable profit margin for permitted fees in §\n170.404(a)(3)(ii) and § 170.404(a)(3)(iv)) in providing certified API technology while being\ncompliant with the Condition and Maintenance of Certification and Program requirements. We\ninclude descriptions of fees for developing, deploying, and upgrading API technology in the\nsections that follow, in which we offer additional clarity, as discussed in the Proposed Rule at 84\nFR 7488, on the fees for developing, deploying, and updating API technology.\n\n(i) Fees for Developing Certified API Technology\nFees for “developing” certified API technology comprise the Certified API Developer’s\ncosts of designing, developing, and testing certified API technology. In keeping with our\ndiscussion at 84 FR 7488, fees for developing certified API technology must not include the\nCertified API Developer’s costs of updating the non-API related capabilities of the Certified API\nDeveloper’s existing Health IT Modules, including its databases, as part of its development of\nthe certified API technology. As we further discussed in 84 FR 7488 in our Proposed Rule, these\ncosts are connected to past business decisions made by the Certified API Developer and typically\narise due to Health IT Modules being designed or implemented in nonstandard ways that\nunnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using\n\n\n\n\nEHI. The recovery of costs associated with updating a Certified API Developer’s non-API\nrelated Health IT Modules capabilities would be inconsistent with the Cures Act requirement that\nAPI technology be deployed “without special effort.”\n\n(ii) Fees for Deploying Certified API Technology\nCertified API Developer’s fees for “deploying” certified API technology comprise the\nCertified API Developer’s costs of operationalizing certified API technology in a production\nenvironment. Such fees include, but are not limited to, standing up hosting infrastructure,\nsoftware installation and configuration, and the creation and maintenance of API Information\nSource administrative functions. We discussed in our Proposed Rule that a Certified API\nDeveloper’s fees for “deploying” certified API technology does not include the costs associated\nwith managing the traffic of API calls that are used to access the certified API technology, which\na Certified API Developer can only recover under the permitted fee for usage support costs\n(§ 170.404(a)(3)(iii)). We emphasize that for the purpose of this Condition of Certification, we\nconsider that certified API technology is “deployed” by the customer—the API Information\nSource—that purchased or licensed it.\n\n(iii) Fees for Upgrading Certified API Technology\nThe Certified API Developer’s fees for “upgrading” certified API technology comprise\nthe Certified API Developer’s costs of supplying an API Information Source with an updated\nversion of certified API technology. Such costs would include the costs required to bring\ncertified API technology into conformity with new requirements of the Program, upgrades to\nimplement general software updates (not otherwise covered by development fees or under\nwarranty), or developing and releasing newer versions of the certified API technology at the\nrequest of an API Information Source. The nature of the costs that can be charged under this\ncategory of permitted fees depends on the scope of the work undertaken by a Certified API\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper (i.e., how much or how little labor an API Information Source requires of the\nCertified API Developer to upgrade the certified API technology being supplied from one\nversion or set of functions to the next).\n\n(F) Permitted Fee to Recover Costs of Supporting API Usage\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7489 in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii) to permit an API Technology Supplier\nto charge API usage-based fees to API Data Providers to recover the API Technology Supplier’s\nreasonable incremental costs for purposes other than facilitating the access, exchange, or use of\nEHI by patients or their applications, technologies, or services. We considered “usage-based”\nfees to be the fees imposed by an API Technology Supplier to recover the costs that would\ntypically be incurred supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale within\nestablished service levels. Additionally, in 84 FR 7489 under § 170.404(a)(3)(iii), we proposed\nthat any usage-based fees associated with API technology be limited to the recovery of the API\nTechnology Supplier's “incremental costs.” Additionally, we proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(A)\nthat the permitted fee would not include any costs incurred by the API Technology Supplier to\nsupport uses of the API technology that facilitate a patient’s ability to access, exchange, or use\ntheir EHI. Finally, we proposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B) – (C) restrictions for permitted fees\nthat were moved to the general permitted fees section finalized in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(C).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported our proposal to permit an API Technology\nSuppliers to charge usage-based fees to API Data Providers to the extent that the API technology\nis used for purposes other than facilitating the access, exchange, or use of EHI by patients or\ntheir applications, technologies, or services.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate support from commenters and have finalized this proposal in §\n170.404(a)(3)(iii) with some modification. We amended the title of the regulation text for clarity\nin § 170.404(a)(3)(iii) to “Permitted fee – Recovering API usage costs.” Additionally, we\n\n\n\n\namended the regulation text to focus on usage-based fees and Certified API Developer’s\nreasonable incremental costs. We did not finalize the specific prohibition on permitted fees\nproposed in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(A) that the “permitted fee does not include costs incurred by the\nAPI Technology Supplier to support uses of the API technology that facilitate a patient’s ability\nto access, exchange, or use electronic health information.” We did not finalize this aspect of the\nprovision because upon further consideration of this cost and the fee prohibition included in\ninformation blocking related to patient access, we determined that these fees remain necessary in\norder to allow Certified API Developers to recover incremental costs reasonably incurred during\nthe process of hosting certified API technology on behalf of the API Information Source. We\nreiterate that a Certified API Developer's “incremental costs” comprise the Certified API\nDeveloper's costs that are directly attributable to supporting API interactions at increasing\nvolumes and scale within established service levels. A Certified API Developer should “price”\nits costs of supporting access to the certified API technology by reference to the additional costs\nthat the Certified API Developer would incur in supporting certain volumes of API use. For\ncomments and responses related to the proposed provisions in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii)(B) and (C),\nwe refer readers to the header “Certified API Developer Prohibited Fees.”\n\n*Comments.* We received a few comments focused on volume thresholds and incremental\ncosts. A few commenters supported a reasonable cap for API call fees. Several recommended\nchanging the parameters around API usage-based fees to focus on volume thresholds being\nincluded in any contractual language related to these fees, to ensure that any incremental costs\nattributable to supporting API interactions at increasing volumes and scale are addressed\nappropriately. Commenters noted that if an API Technology Supplier is receiving fees to\ndevelop, deploy, and upgrade API technology, it is unlikely that they would also need to charge\nfor usage of the APIs, as long as their usage remains under a pre-determined volume threshold. A\n\n\n\n\nfew commenters noted that the volume of requests that will be pinging APIs may compromise\nthe performance of data retrieval and effective user experience. In order to protect against denial\nof service attacks whether intentional or inadvertent, they stated ONC should consider an\nadditional throttling or rate-limiting layer or capability onto the API in order for the API to\naccept and digest the data being entered or extracted. A few commenters noted that our proposal\ncould create loopholes that would enable certain organizations to charge highly burdensome,\nexcessive fees to clinical registries to access their data.\n\nA few commenters expressed concern that this proposal is not restrictive enough. Some\ncommenters requested that ONC provide more definitive guidance, including a range of prices\nbased on examples from the current marketplace, to ensure providers are not charged\nunreasonable fees by API Technology Suppliers and can reasonably charge API Users for the\ncost of accessing their API technology.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. This Condition of Certification\nrequirement offers the flexibility necessary to accommodate reasonable pricing methodologies\nand will allow Certified API Developers to explore innovative approaches to recovering the costs\nassociated with supporting the use of certified API technology with a permitted fee. As described\nin the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7489), “usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified API\nDeveloper to recover costs typically incurred for supporting API interactions at increasing\nvolumes and scale within established service levels. That is, “usage-based” fees recover costs\nincurred by a Certified API Developer due to the actual use of the certified API technology once\nit has been deployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via\nthe certified API technology). Certified API Developers can adopt a range of pricing\nmethodologies when charging for the support of API usage. We appreciate commenters’ request\nto establish a reasonable cap for API usage-based fees, but the focus of our policy is to identify\n\n\n\n\nusage fees as a type of permitted fee and not to dictate a singular fee model, which we believe\ncould limit Certified API Developers ability to create innovative fee models that serve to benefit\nthemselves and API Information Sources. We decline to include a price cap for API usage-based\nfees or a range of prices for API fees based on examples from the current marketplace because\nwe anticipate the cost of technology will change over time and so too will the way in which\nusage costs are calculated. Additionally, while we understand and expect that Certified API\nDevelopers and API Information Sources will deploy particular security methods to mitigate the\nrisk of denial of service attacks and other impacts on API availability, these types of technology\nlayers are separate from the focus of our policy on permitted API usage fees.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that ONC further clarify that API Technology\nSuppliers should not attempt to charge different fees for different API transactions as they\nfrequently do today.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this information and feedback from commenters. We clarify\nthat Certified API Developers are permitted to charge “usage-based” fees to recover the costs\nthat would typically be incurred supporting API transactions at increasing volumes and scale\nwithin established service levels. To clarify, usage-based fees recover costs incurred by a\nCertified API Developer related to the actual use of certified API technology once it has been\ndeployed (e.g., costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the API\nTechnology). We acknowledge that Certified API Developers could adopt a range of pricing\nmethodologies when charging for the support of API usage, including potentially charging\nhigher prices for some API transactions that incur relatively higher costs than others. However,\nin combination with this flexibility, Certified API Developers will still need to be mindful of not\nviolating any overarching information blocking policies. We refer readers to a discussion in the\nProposed Rule in 84 FR 7489 for additional discussions on usage-based fees.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters emphasized that it is unreasonable to presume that API\nUser-driven data overages should be the responsibility of the API Data Provider. While other\ncommenters expressed concern that our proposal will leave providers, who are mandated to use\ncertified EHRs that include API technology and provide patients with access to data via those\nAPIs, responsible for a variety of unwarranted costs with little recourse to recover those costs.\n\n*Response.* While we understand the perspective from which these concerns arise,\nespecially regarding unpredictable overuse of certified API technology, an API Information\nSource has financial responsibility for its overall technology infrastructure. This accountability is\nno different for certified API technology than it is for non-certified APIs and other interfaces that\nmay also create costs for the API Information Source (i.e., health care provider). Given that API\nUsers can also include an API Information Source’s own employees/internal tools and 3rd\nparty\npartners’ tools, an API Information Source is best positioned and generally accountable for its\nfinancial commitments. Again, as noted above, we do not limit who may pay for the charges an\nAPI Information Source incurs. An API Information Source should have full knowledge and\nability to assess what employees, internal applications, and 3rd\nparty services it has granted\naccess to use and interact with its certified API technology. With respect to potential overages as\na result of patient access, as we have stated before, we believe patients have effectively paid for\nthis information, either directly or through their employers, health plans, and other entities that\nnegotiate and purchase health care items and services on their behalf, and believe they should not\nbe charged.\n\nAdditionally, as stated in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7489) and finalized here, usage fees\nfor certified API technology will only apply when the Certified API Developer acts on behalf of\nthe API Information Source to deploy its certified API technology. In scenarios where the API\nInformation Source, such as a large hospital system, assumes full responsibility for the technical\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure necessary to deploy and host the certified API technology it has acquired, the\nvolume and scale of its usage would be the API Information Source’s sole responsibility, and a\nCertified API Developer would not be permitted to charge usage-based fees. Instead, the\nCertified API Developer would be limited to charge fees under the “development, deployment,\nupgrade” permitted fee in § 170.404(a)(3)(ii). Additionally, the costs recovered under “usage-\nbased” fees can only reflect “post-deployment” costs. As such, “usage-based” fees cannot\ninclude any costs necessary to prepare and “get the certified API technology up, running, and\nready for use,” which are costs that must be recovered as part of the deployment services\ndelivered by the Certified API Developer if permitted under § 170.404(a)(3)(ii).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported ONC’s efforts to bolster patient access, noting\nthat the capacity to offer a patient’s access to all elements of their electronic medical record,\nthrough an API, without cost, is well-supported in the Proposed Rule. One commenter noted that\nthe proposed provisions regarding fees supports uses of the API technology that facilitate a\npatient’s ability to access, exchange, or use their EHI. The commenters noted that the clear\nlanguage in the Proposed Rule will prevent any potential confusion or friction in the future.\n\nA few commenters expressed concern that application developers will attempt to leverage\nthe patient access fee limitations by claiming to be patient facing. One commenter suggested that\nthe proposed fee limitations regarding patient access applied only with respect to fees API\nTechnology Providers impose on API Data Providers, should also apply to fees charged to\nconsumer-facing application developers who in the past have been charged high fees by CEHRT\ndevelopers. One commenter recommended making it clear that provider organizations and health\nIT developers cannot charge patients, or the apps that they use, for using patient-facing APIs. At\nleast one commenter requested that ONC clarify that permitted usage-based fees do not apply to\npatients or patient designees.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support for restricting API-related fees. As\nnoted above, we have reconfigured the permitted fee for usage costs in response to public\ncomments and our assessment of the intersection of API permitted fees policies and information\nblocking policies. We have finalized an approach that permits Certified API Developers to\nrecover incremental usage costs reasonably incurred during the process of hosting certified API\ntechnology on behalf of an API Information Source, which could include fees to the API\nInformation Source for providing and supporting patient access. However, the Certified API\nDevelopers and API Information Sources cannot recover these costs from patients or the\ndevelopers of applications that facilitate access to and receipt of patients’ EHI. Patients have\nalready effectively paid for their EHI, either directly or through their employers, health plans,\nand other entities that negotiate and purchase health care items and services on their behalf. We\nrefer readers to the Fees Exception in the information blocking section of this final rule in\nVII.D.2.b, which applies to health IT developers and a broader set of actors than these Condition\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements, for a discussion of the restrictions on charging\npatients for access to their EHI.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that ONC provide further guidance on the\ntypes of costs that a developer could charge to permit API Data Suppliers to offer population-\nlevel queries to API Users. They requested ONC clarify that such usages fees must relate to the\ncosts associated with actual hardware (e.g., server space) needed to support the increased volume\nof queries for non-patients and not the cost of implementing the population-level query\nfunctionality itself.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that API usage fees related to API “read” services for multiple\npatients would be calculated using a similar methodology to calculate API usage fees related to\nAPI “read” services for single patients. These “usage-based” fees are fees imposed by a Certified\n\n\n\n\nAPI Developer to recover the costs typically incurred to support API interactions for API “read”\nservices for multiple patients once these services have been deployed. This could include, but not\nbe limited to, costs to support a higher volume of traffic, data, or number of apps via the certified\nAPI technology (which could include higher costs for hardware, including server space). We\nappreciate the recommendation from commenters; however, we have not prescribed the\ncentralization of all of this content.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters suggested that API Technology Suppliers publish their\nfees on the same website as their API documentation so there is full transparency and an API\nData Supplier and API User can easily understand costs before embarking upon development.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the recommendation and support from commenters. As\nfinalized under § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(B), a Certified API Developer must publish all terms and\nconditions for its certified API technology, including any fees. Any and all fees charged by a\nCertified API Developer for the use of its certified API technology must be described in detailed,\nplain language, including the persons or classes of persons to whom the fee applies; the\ncircumstances in which the fee applies; and the amount of the fee, which for variable fees must\ninclude the specific variable(s) and methodology(ies) that will be used to calculate the fee.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that usage-based fees may not be appropriate. They\nstated that, in the case of TEFCA, HIEs and providers must be responsive to inbound requests to\nbroadcast data and should not be charged a fee for responding to such requests. They explained\nthat such an arrangement could be used maliciously between market participants seeking to\nincrease the operational expenses of their competitors.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment, but we continue to believe that that usage-based\nfees should be permitted subject to the conditions described in § 170.404(a)(3)(iii). We have\naddressed commenter’s concern regarding potential anticompetitive behavior through the final\n\n\n\n\nprovisions in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B). Specifically, in § 170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(1), a Certified API\nDeveloper must ensure that fees are based on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly\napplied for all similarly situated classes of persons and requests. In addition, under §\n170.404(a)(3)(i)(B)(4), a Certified API Developer must ensure that fees are not based in any part\non whether the requestor or other person is a competitor, potential competitor, or will be using\nthe certified API technology in a way that facilitates competition with the Certified API\nDeveloper.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concern about incremental costs that can be\nrecovered by actors supporting the use of APIs for purposes other than patient access. They\nrequested ONC clarify that recovery of incremental costs for these other purposes should not be\nallowed, because they believed the incremental costs do not add any efficiency to the health care\nsystem, do not benefit patients, and do not serve any other procompetitive purpose.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments, but continue to believe that “incremental\ncosts” should be allowed. A Certified API Developer’s “incremental costs” comprise the\nCertified API Developer’s costs that are directly attributable to supporting API interactions at\nincreasing volumes and scale within established service levels. We believe a Certified API\nDeveloper should “price” its costs of supporting access to the certified API technology by\nreference to the additional costs that the Certified API Developer would incur in supporting\ncertain volumes of API use. In practice, we expect that this means that a Certified API Developer\nwill offer a certain number of “free” API calls based on the fact that, up to a certain threshold,\nthe Certified API Developer will not incur any material costs in supporting certified API\ntechnology in addition to the costs recovered for deployment services. However, after this\nthreshold is exceeded, we expect that the Certified API Developer will impose usage-based costs\n\n\n\n\ncommensurate to the additional costs that the Certified API Developer must incur to support\ncertified API technology use at increasing volumes and scale.\n\nWe expect that Certified API Developers will charge fees that are correlated to the\nincremental rising of costs required to meet increased demand. For example, if, at a certain\nvolume of API calls, the Certified API Developer needed to deploy additional server capacity,\nthe associated incremental cost of bringing an additional server online could be passed on to the\nAPI Information Source because the certified API technology deployed on behalf of the API\nInformation Source was the subject of the higher usage. In this example, up until the point that\nthe threshold is reached, the additional server capacity is not required, so the Certified API\nDeveloper would not be permitted to recover the costs associated with it. Moreover, the\nadditional server capacity would support ongoing demand up to a certain additional volume, so\nthe Certified API Developer would not be permitted to recover the costs of further additional\nserver capacity until the existing capacity was exhausted.\n\n(G) Permitted Fee for Value-added Services\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7490 and 7491 in § 170.404(a)(3)(iv) to permit an API\nTechnology Supplier to charge fees to API Users for value-added services supplied in connection\nwith software that can interact with the API technology. We also clarified in 84 FR 7491 that a\nfee will only be permitted if it relates to a service that an API User, such as a software developer,\ncan elect to purchase, but is not required to purchase in order to develop and deploy production-\nready apps for API technology.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported our proposal to permit an API Technology\nSupplier to charge fees to API Users for value-added services supplied in connection with\nsoftware that can interact with certified API technology. Some commenters requested certain\nclarifications regarding our proposal. One commenter requested that we clarify within the\n\n\n\n\ndiscussion of value-added services, that references to “app stores” and “listing processes” for\nsoftware applications that register to connect with the API technology are solely intended as\nexamples to illustrate when a fee would or would not qualify as a “value-added service,” and are\nnot meant to convey a requirement or expectation that API Technology Suppliers provide an app\nstore with application listing free of charge. A few commenters requested that ONC clarify that\nEHR developers can charge value-add fees without triggering the information blocking\nprovision. A couple other commenters requested additional examples of what constitutes a\n“value-added” service for which an API Technology Supplier can charge fees to an API User.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback. We have finalized § 170.404(a)(3)(iv)\nas proposed, with the exception of updating terms based on the definitions finalized in\n§ 170.404(c). Our final policy permits Certified API Developers to charge fees, including a\nreasonable profit margin, to API Users for value-added services related to certified API\ntechnology, so long as such services are not necessary to efficiently and effectively develop and\ndeploy production-ready software that interacts with certified API technology. We clarify that\nthe value-added services need to be provided in connection with and supplemental to the\ndevelopment, testing, and deployment of production-ready software applications that interact\nwith certified API technology. A fee is permitted if it relates to a service that a software\ndeveloper can elect to purchase from a Certified API Developer, but is not required to purchase\nin order to develop and deploy production-ready apps for certified API technology.\n\nIn response to comments for clarity, we note that examples used to illustrate when a fee\nwould or would not qualify as a “value-added service,” such as app store listing, are\ndemonstrative, but not required unless otherwise noted in the regulation text. Under this\ncondition, we permit fees for services associated with the listing and promotion of apps beyond\nbasic application placement so long as the Certified API Developer ensures that basic access and\n\n\n\n\nlisting in the app store is provided free of charge (if an application developer depended on such\nlisting to efficiently and effectively develop and deploy production-ready apps for use with\ncertified API technology). Fees charged for additional/specialized technical support or promotion\nof the API User’s application beyond basic access and listing services would be examples of\npermitted value-added services. We caution health IT developers not to over-interpret the scope\nof this Condition of Certification, which is focused on certified API technology. To the degree\nthat a health IT developer administers an “app store” and offers value-added services associated\nwith certified API technology, the Condition of Certification covers its practices related to\ncertified API technology only. Conversely, this Condition of Certification would not apply to\nany practices that do not involve certified API technology. However, health IT developers would\nneed to be mindful of any applicable information blocking rules that may apply to their app store\npractices given applicable facts and circumstances. Regarding the request for specific value-\nadded fees that would not constitute information blocking, we refer readers to the information\nblocking section (VIII) of this preamble.\n\n(H) Request for Comment on § 170.404(a)(3)\nWe requested comment at 84 FR 7491 on any additional specific “permitted fees” not\naddressed in our Proposed Rule (84 FR 7491) that commenters felt API Technology Suppliers\nshould be able to recover in order to assure a reasonable return on investment. Furthermore, we\nrequested comment on whether it would be prudent to adopt specific, or more granular, cost\nmethodologies for the calculation of the permitted fees. We encouraged commenters to consider,\nin particular, whether the approach we described would be administrable and appropriately\nbalance the need to ensure that stakeholders do not encounter unnecessary costs and other special\neffort with the need to provide adequate assurance to API Technology Suppliers, investors, and\ninnovators that they will earn a reasonable return on their investments in API technology. We\n\n\n\n\nwelcomed comments on whether the approach adequately balances these concerns and achieves\nour stated policy goals. We also welcomed comments on potential revisions or alternative\napproaches. We encouraged detailed comments that included, where possible, economic\njustifications for suggested revisions or alternative approaches.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested we alter our approach to APIs so that it is tiered fee\nstructure. They suggested that ONC could establish categories where the technology\nrequirements designate the fees: (1) a “no fee” category would limit API Technology Suppliers\nfrom charging API Data Providers or API Users any fees for exchanging data in compliance with\nFederal requirements; (2) an “at cost” category would allow API Technology Suppliers to charge\nAPI Data Providers or API Users the cost of interfacing APIs with a non-API Technology\nSupplier’s commercial technology; and (3) a “cost plus reasonable profit” category would allow\nAPI Technology Suppliers to charge API Data Providers or API Users a reasonable profit when\nconducting legitimate custom API development or creating custom apps.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the recommendation from commenters, but we have not\nadopted a tiered fee structure in the final rule because it would require unnecessary specificity\nand prescribe a particular method that could have unintended effects of limiting the market’s\nevolution over time. We believe the current structure for prohibited and permitted fees allows for\nthe adequate cost recovery and reasonable profit by Certified API Developers while also\nestablishing the guardrails around which API access can be enabled without special effort.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters expressed concerns related to the effect our proposals\nregarding API fees would have on innovation and business. Several commenters noted that the\nstructure of permitted fees could have unintended consequences that will ultimately work to\nimpede innovation, increase administrative burden, and focus on cost recovery rather than\ncreation of novel ways to improve data access.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral developers stated that the proposed fee structure specifically works to sever\nbusiness relationships between API Technology Providers and API Users for anything other than\n“value added services” and effectively eliminates the ability for API Users to work directly with\nAPI Technology Suppliers to innovate and accelerate API development, and to achieve truly\nintegrated and supported products throughout the product lifecycle. They suggested that a better\nmodel would be one that gives API Data Providers rights to leverage APIs “without special\neffort,” while supporting the ability for API Technology Suppliers and API Users to voluntarily\nengage in direct business relationships under mutually agreeable terms that are fair and equitable.\n\nSome developers stated that the market should determine permitted fees. They stated that in\norder to maintain a vigorously competitive market, API Technology Suppliers must be\nadequately compensated for their work to create and deploy non-standard APIs and support\nexpanding standards. They explained that without this compensation, there will be far fewer\nentrants into the certified health IT space and current participants will depart.\n\nA couple of developers recommended that ONC allow revenue-sharing models for\ncertain components of certified APIs. The commenters suggested that ONC should view revenue\nsharing arrangements as a type of market-based compensation that will ultimately benefit\ninnovation and competition. Conversely, one commenter stated that it is essential that API\nTechnology Suppliers be expressly prohibited from conditioning access to API technology on\ncharging revenue-sharing or royalty agreements to API Data Providers or API Users outside of\nactual usage costs incurred. The commenter noted this rent-seeking behavior is anti-competitive\nin nature and can have a significant impact on squelching any new market entrants and allow\nexisting health IT actors to prevent all the positive outcomes that could arise from the ONC’s\nproposed rules. Some developers stated that the prohibition against health IT developers\ncharging for work to update their code structure is unreasonable, emphasizing that this is\n\n\n\n\nimportant work that is necessary for companies to be able to modernize their solutions as broader\ntechnologies evolve.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments, but disagree with commenters regarding the\npotential negative effect of the final permitted fee structure on innovation. We also note that the\nvalue-added services permitted fee does permit a direct relationship between Certified API\nDevelopers and API Users. What is generally prohibited and what we noted presented “special\neffort” in the Proposed Rule were Certified API Developer practices that required an API\nInformation Source to seek permission to use its own certified API technology from the Certified\nAPI Developer.\n\nWe reiterate that complying with the requirements of this permitted fee and the\ninformation blocking exception will generally not prevent an actor from making a reasonable\nprofit in connection with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. To be responsive to comments, we\nhave added a provision in § 171.404(a)(3)(i)(A) to clarify this point. This final provision states\nthat certain permitted API fees (§ 170.404(a)(3)(ii) and § 170.404(a)(3)(iv)) may include fees\nthat result in a reasonable profit margin in accordance with the Costs Exception (§ 171.302). We\nbelieve that the allowance of reasonable profits is necessary to incentivize innovation and allow\ninnovators to earn returns on the investments they have made to develop, maintain, and update\ninnovations that ultimately improve health care delivery and benefit patients. Our finalized\napproach to API fees strikes the appropriate balance of addressing the rent-seeking and\nexclusionary pricing practices noted by the commenters while enabling and supporting\ninnovation.\n\nWe also emphasize that a majority of the EHI has been generated and recorded in the\ncourse of furnishing health care services paid with public dollars through Federal programs,\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid, or directly subsidized through the tax preferences for\n\n\n\n\nemployer-based insurance. Yet, this EHI is not readily available where and when it is needed. We\nbelieve the overwhelming benefits of publishing certified APIs that allow EHI from\nsuch technology to be accessed, exchanged, and used without special effort far outweigh the\npotential burden on Certified API Developers and API Information Sources.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested that ONC clarify whether API Data Suppliers\nwould be allowed to recoup costs from API Users in light of the information blocking provisions.\n\nA few commenters expressed confusion that fees are addressed under the API Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification and information blocking. The commenters suggested that ONC\naddress fees in one consolidated section.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment and refer readers to the information blocking\nsection of this rule. We do not believe that a discussion of fees should be consolidated in one\nsection for a couple of reasons. First, the information blocking provision has a much broader\nreach than the Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements and regulates conduct of\nhealth IT developers of certified Health IT Modules, health care providers, health information\nnetworks, and health information exchanges. The Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements only relate to conduct by health IT developers of certified Health IT Modules.\n\nSecond, the API Condition of Certification covers a much narrower scope of potential fees, as\nthe fees in this section are specific to certified API technology only while fees in the information\nblocking section generally relate to the access, exchange, or use of EHI regardless of the\nparticular technology used.\n\nWe emphasize that we have finalized a provision in § 171.302(c) that if the actor is a\nhealth IT developer subject to the Condition of Certification requirements in § 170.402(a)(4)\n(Assurances), § 170.404 (API), or both, the actor must comply with all requirements of such\nconditions for all practices and at all relevant times. Under this provision, health IT developers of\n\n\n\n\ncertified Health IT Modules subject to the API Condition of Certification requirements may not\ncharge certain types of fees and are subject to more specific cost accountability provisions than\napply generally under the Costs Exception. We explain in the Costs Exception that a failure of\ndevelopers to comply with these additional requirements would impose impediments to\nconsumer and other stakeholder access to EHI without special effort and would be suspect under\nthe information blocking provision.\nvi. Openness and Pro-competitive Conditions\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7595 in § 170.404(a)(4) that an API Technology Supplier must\ngrant API Data Providers the sole authority and autonomy to permit API Users to interact with\nthe API technology deployed by the API Data Provider in a non-discriminatory manner; provide\nall reasonably necessary support and other services to enable the effective development,\ndeployment, and use of API technology by API Data Providers and its API Users to access,\nexchange, and use EHI in production environments; not impose collateral terms or agreements\nthat could interfere with the use of API technology; and provide reasonable notice prior to\nmaking changes to its API technology or terms and conditions.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of commenters supported the proposed openness and pro-\ncompetitive conditions. Several commenters requested clarification about API Data Providers’\nrights and responsibilities when providing access to an application of a patient’s choice.\n\nSpecifically, they sought clarification on whether they can vet, deny, or limit access by\napplications that are using the API technology inappropriately. Another commenter proposed\nthat app developers be required to obtain a business associate agreement (BAA) with providers\nprior to the application developer gaining access to a patient’s EHI on behalf of a patient.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Based on the support from\ncommenters, we have finalized that a Certified API Developer must grant API Information\n\n\n\n\nSources the independent ability to permit API Users to interact with the certified API technology\ndeployed by the API Information Source in § 170.404(a)(4).\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a business associate relationship exists if an entity\ncreates, receives, maintains, or transmits ePHI on behalf of a covered entity (directly or through\nanother business associate) to carry out the covered functions of the covered entity. HIPAA does\nnot require a covered entity (e.g., API Information Source) or its business associate (e.g., API\nTechnology Supplier) to enter into a business associate agreement with an app developer that\ndoes not create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI on behalf of or for the benefit of the covered\nentity (whether directly or through another business associate). However, if the app was\ndeveloped to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI on behalf of the covered entity (API\nInformation Source), or was provided by or on behalf of the covered entity (directly or through\nits API Technology Supplier, acting as the covered entity's business associate), then a business\nassociate agreement would be required.106\nIn such cases, API Information Sources have the\nability to conduct whatever “vetting” they deem necessary of entities (e.g., app developers) that\nwould be their business associates under the HIPAA Rules before granting access and use of EHI\nto the entities. In this regard, covered entities must conduct necessary vetting in order to comply\nwith the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\nFor third-party applications chosen by individuals to facilitate their access to their EHI\nheld by actors, there would not be a need for a BAA as discussed above. There would also\ngenerally not be a need for “vetting” on security grounds and such vetting actions otherwise\nwould be an interference. Please see our discussion of “vetting” in the “Interference Versus\nEducation When an Individual Chooses Technology to Facilitate Access” discussion in the\n106\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access-right-health-apps-apis/index.html\n\n\n\n\nInformation Blocking section of the preamble (Section VIII). We also refer readers to our\ndiscussion of “vetting” versus verifying an app developer’s authenticity under the API Condition\nof Certification later in this section of the preamble.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification about the types of business\nrelationships permitted between API Technology Suppliers and API Users and requested\nexamples of permitted activities and responsibilities under each role. These comments expressed\nconcern about prohibiting API Technology Suppliers from being able to form direct relationships\nwith API Users for the purpose of joint development and commercialization of their products.\n\nOther commenters requested clarifications about relationships that existed prior to the\ninvolvement of an API Data Provider.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. Based on the general support,\nwe have finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(A) that a Certified API Developer must provide certified\nAPI technology to API Information Sources on terms that are no less favorable than it provides\nto itself and its own customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a\nbusiness relationship. Additionally, we have finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(B) that the terms on\nwhich a Certified API Developer provides certified API technology must be based on objective\nand verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied to all substantially similar or similarly situated\nclasses of persons and requests. Furthermore, we have finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(i)(C) that a\nCertified API Developer must not offer different terms or services on the basis of: Competition\nor potential for competition and revenue or other value the other party receiving the services may\nreceive from using the certified API technology. We note that we slightly modified the finalized\nrequirements in § 170.404(a)(4)(i) based on the revised definitions finalized in § 170.404(c). We\nclarify that this rule does not prohibit Certified API Developers from forming business\nrelationships with API Users. To the degree that a Certified API Developer seeks to charge an\n\n\n\n\nAPI User for particular services associated with its certified API technology, it would need to do\nso pursuant to the “value-added services” permitted fee.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested clarification about how “the sole authority and\nautonomy to unilaterally permit connections to their health IT through certified API technology”\napplies to application registration. Specifically, they asked whether API Users are required to\nregister once with the API Technology Supplier, or several times with each instance of API\ntechnology deployed by API Data Providers.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We refer commenters to §\n170.315(g)(10)(iii) for the application registration requirements for Health IT Modules presented\nfor certification. In general, we do not prescribe the registration paradigm that Certified API\nDevelopers create for themselves and their customers. Thus, in different scenarios, an API User\nmay only be required to register once with an Certified API Developer, or several times with\neach instance of a § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT Module deployed by an API Information\nSource. When it comes to apps that focus on the “launch-ehr\" “SMART on FHIR Core\nCapability” from the implementation specification adopted in 170.215(a)(3), such an approach\nwill be tightly integrated with the Health IT Modules deployed by API Information Sources.\n\nBecause of the tight integration between API Information Sources and Health IT Modules,\nregistration for these apps could more often fall to the API Information Source. When it comes to\napps that enable patient access, registration could be handled centrally by Certified API\nDevelopers or in a distributed manner with each API Information Source, especially in cases\nwhere API Information Sources take full responsibility for administering their § 170.315(g)(10)-\ncertified Health IT Modules.\n\nRegarding “the sole authority and autonomy to unilaterally permit connections to their\nhealth IT through certified API technology,” we have finalized in 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(A) that\n\n\n\n\nCertified API Developer must have and, upon request, must grant to API Information Sources\nand API Users all rights that may be reasonably necessary to (1) access and use certified API\ntechnology in a production environment; (2) develop products and services that are designed to\ninteract with the Certified API Developer’s API technology; and (3) market, offer, and distribute\nproducts and services associated with the Certified API Developer’s certified API technology.\n\nAdditionally, we have finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(B) that a Certified API Developer\nmust not condition any of the rights described in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(A) on: (1) receiving a fee,\nincluding but not limited to a license fee, royalty, or revenue-sharing arrangement; (2) agreeing\nto not compete; (3) agreeing to deal exclusively with the Certified API Developer; (4) Obtaining\nadditional services that are not related to the certified API technology; (5) sharing intellectual\nproperty with the Certified API Developer; (6) meeting any Certified API Developer-specific\ntesting or certification requirements; and (7) providing the Certified API Developer or\ntechnology with reciprocal access to application data. We slightly modified the conditions from\nthe Proposed Rule for what we finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(B) for clarity, and amended terms\nto the revised definitions finalized in § 170.404(c). Additionally, we clarify that while Certified\nAPI Developers are not permitted to condition the rights described in § 170.404(a)(4)(ii)(A) on\nreceiving a fee, Certified API Developers are permitted to charge fees compliant with the\npermitted fees described in § 170.404(a)(3). We also clarify that “meeting any Certified API\nDeveloper-specific testing or certification requirements” would include preconditions like\nregistering and testing in a testing environment prior to moving to production, and meeting\nCertified API Developer-created certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concern about software applications maintaining\ncompatibility when upgrading API technology, and highlighted the importance of adopting\nbackwards-compatible standards.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We share the concern\nexpressed by commenters. We specifically consider features of standards like backwards\ncompatibility when proposing and finalizing testing and certification requirements for the\nProgram. As mentioned above, we have finalized the standard adopted in § 170.215(a)(1) as the\nbase standard for the certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(g)(10) Standardized API for\nPatient and Population Services. We note that the standard adopted in § 170.215(a)(1) includes\nmany FHIR resources that need to retain their compatibility over time, which will help as\nupgrades to newer standards occur. Additionally, we have finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii) the\nservice and support obligations required by a Certified API Developer, including the\nrequirements that a Certified API Developer must provide all support and other services\nreasonably necessary to enable the effective development, deployment, and use of certified API\ntechnology by API Information Sources and API Users in production environments. These\ninclude requirements for changes and updates to API technology finalized in §\n170.404(a)(4)(iii)(A), where Certified API Developers must make reasonable efforts to maintain\nthe compatibility of its certified API technology and to otherwise avoid disrupting the use of\ncertified API technology in production environments, and requirements for changes to terms and\nconditions finalized in § 170.404(a)(4)(iii)(B), where Certified API Developers must provide\nnotice and reasonable opportunity for its API Information Source customers and registered API\nUsers to update their applications to preserve compatibility with API technology and to comply\nwith applicable terms and conditions.\ne. API Maintenance of Certification Requirements\ni. Authenticity Verification\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7486 in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C) to permit API Technology\nSuppliers to verify the authenticity of application developers, limited to a duration of no greater\n\n\n\n\nthan five business days of receipt of a request to register an application developer’s software\nwith the API technology. We noted the authenticity verification process would need to be\nobjective, apply to the application developer and not their software, and be the same for all\napplication developers. We sought comment in 84 FR 7486 on factors that would enable\nregistration with minimal barriers, including options and associated trade-offs. Additionally, we\nsought comment at 84 FR 7486 on other timing considerations for application developer\nauthenticity verification.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters asked for a longer timeframe to complete the authenticity\nverification process of application developers. Some commenters asked to extend the\nauthenticity verification timeframe to ten business days. Commenters suggested adding “and any\nreceipt of any additional requested information needed in order to verify the developer’s\nauthenticity” to “within five business days of receipt of an application developer’s request to\nregister their software application with the API technology provider’s authorization server.”\n\nCommenters suggested various methods for verifying the authenticity of application\ndevelopers and applications, including by proposing required registration information, or\nrequired attestation to model privacy guidelines or industry best practices. Other commenters\nsuggested various approaches for verifying application developers and applications, including by\nworking with industry to establish a verification body, privacy and security trust or certification\nframework, and other more detailed recommendations. Several commenters suggested requiring\napplication developers to attest to providing a model privacy notice to patients. Commenters\nsuggested mandating terms and conditions and consent requirements as part of the registration\nprocess.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate feedback from commenters. To improve the organization of\nthese Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we moved the requirements\n\n\n\n\nproposed in § 170.404(a)(2)(ii)(C) to the finalized § 170.404(b)(1)(i) under the combined §\n170.404(b)(1), “Authenticity verification and registration for production use.” We accept\ncommenters’ requests to establish a longer time period for this permitted, but not required,\nprocess to verify the authenticity of application developers who seek to register their software\napplication for use with the Certified API Developer’s certified API technology. We have\nadopted ten business days as the timeframe by which this process would need to be completed\nand as a result find it unnecessary to add the text contemplating a back and forth between the\nCertified API Developer and API User. We recommend that Certified API Developers who elect\nto institute a verification process implement a process that is as automated as possible to ensure\nthey remain in compliance with our final policy. Given that we combined authenticity\nverification and registration for production use in one requirement finalized in § 170.404(b)(1),\nwe reduced the scope of these requirements to Certified API Developers with a Health IT\nModule certified to the certification criterion adopted in § 170.315(g)(10) to remain consistent\nwith the scope of applicability of registration for production use from the Proposed Rule.\n\nWe also note that authenticity verifications would likely occur more frequently for\npatient-facing applications that are not sponsored by API Information Sources. We anticipate that\nan API Information Source (e.g., a health care organization) that is a HIPAA covered entity\nwould vet and enter into a HIPAA business associate agreement with a provider-facing\napplication developer prior to using the application within their internal technical enterprise. In\ncomparison, a patient-facing application is likely to connect to an API Information Source’s\nresource server using a public service base URL of a § 170.315(g)(10)-certified Health IT\nModule in service to the patient’s HIPAA Privacy Rule right of access (45 CFR 164.524) or\nbased on a patient’s HIPAA authorization (45 CFR 164.508) without first establishing a\nrelationship with the API Information Source. For patient-facing applications, and to the\n\n\n\n\ncomments suggesting we require various modes of attestation to privacy guidelines in such\ncontexts, we refer commenters to the information blocking provisions in section VIII for a\ndiscussion of permitted behaviors regarding privacy attestations.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters suggested including a warning by the API Data Provider that the\napplication developer selected by the patient or patient-designee is untrusted.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. An API Information Source would\nnot be prohibited from showing a warning to patients as part of the patient authorization for an\napplication to receive their EHI from an API Information Source. This could include a warning\nthat an application attempting to access data on behalf of a patient is untrusted. We refer\ncommenters to the information blocking provisions in section VIII for additional information\nabout providing warnings to patients.\nii. Registration for Production Use\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7494 in § 170.404(b)(1) to require API Technology Suppliers to\nregister and enable all applications for production use within one business day of completing its\nverification of an application developer’s authenticity.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters generally supported the proposed registration requirements.\n\nMost commenters suggested extending the registration timeframe to five business days.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We have reorganized this\nsection of the regulation text for readability by combining “Authenticity verification” with\n“Registration for production use” under the heading “Authenticity verification and registration\nfor production use” in § 170.404(b)(1). We accepted the recommendation from commenters to\nextend the registration timeline and have finalized in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) a requirement for\nCertified API Developers with Health IT Modules certified to the certification criterion finalized\nin § 170.315(g)(10) to register and enable all applications for production use within five business\n\n\n\n\ndays of completing its verification of an application developer’s authenticity pursuant to\nrequirements finalized in § 170.404(b)(1)(i).\niii. Service Base URL Publication\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7595 in § 170.404(b)(2) to require an API Technology Supplier to\nsupport the publication of service base URLs for all of its customers, and make such information\npublicly available, in a computable format, at no charge.\n\n*Comments.* A majority of commenters supported the proposal requiring API Technology\nSuppliers to publish service base URLs for all of its customers. Several commenters\nrecommended the creation of a single, publicly available repository to maintain all client\nendpoints. Some stakeholders recommended ONC require additional facility information be\npublished with the service base URL. Commenters who disagreed with this proposal stated that\nhealth IT developers cannot publish client information without their consent, and that API Data\nProviders should have the sole authority to publish their endpoints.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters on their feedback on our proposal requiring a Certified\nAPI Developer to publish service base URLs for all of its customers. The public availability and\neasy accessibility of this information is a central necessity to assuring the use of certified API\ntechnology without special effort, particularly for patient-facing applications. We agree with the\npoints made by commenters on the need for a single or multiple publicly available repositories\nthat maintain provider service base URLs. We encourage industry to coalesce around the\ndevelopment of a public resource from which all stakeholders could benefit. We believe this\nwould help scale and enhance the ease with which service base URLs could be obtained and\nused. While we support the concept of repositories for service base URLs, we do not believe that\ncreating a requirement under the Program is the appropriate mechanism to foster industry\nsupport around this concept at this time.\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge that stakeholders expressed concern about Certified API Developers\npublishing client service base URLs and revised our approach to focus on service base URLs\nnecessary to support patient access. We anticipate that many services related to certified API\ntechnology will be developed and made available and do not believe it is appropriate to burden\nCertified API Developers with publishing all service base URLs for these services for all of their\ncustomers. We considered several options, including requiring Certified API Developers to\npublish service base URLs for only those API Information Source customers for whom they\nmanage / host an authorization server centrally. However, we determined that alternative options\nwould not meet our policy interests and would lead to unnecessarily complex and burdensome\napproaches and would not achieve the Cures Act’s goals of enabling EHI to be accessed,\nexchanged, and used without special effort. Additionally, we considered requiring that all\nCertified API Developers with certified API technology, that is, health IT developers with a\nHealth IT Module certified to § 170.315(g)(7) through (10), meet this requirement. However, we\ndetermined that it would be more beneficial to allow health IT developers to focus energy and\nresources on upgrading their technology to the certification criterion finalized in §\n170.315(g)(10). Therefore, we have finalized in § 170.404(b)(2) that a Certified API Developer\nmust publish service base URLs for all Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) that can\nbe used by patients to access their EHI. We further require that a Certified API Developer must\npublicly publish service base URLs for all customers in a machine-readable format at no charge\nregardless of whether the Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are centrally managed\nby the Certified API Developer or locally deployed by an API Information Source. We note our\nfocus for this criterion on “service base URLs for Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(g)(10) that can be used by patients to access their EHI.” We believe that Certified API\nDevelopers will have adequate relationships with API Information Sources in the process of\n\n\n\n\nproviding Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) and will be able to collect and publish\nall service base URLs that support patient access on behalf of their customers. Furthermore, we\nnote that API Information Sources would be obligated to share such service base URLs with\nCertified API Developers to avoid violating the Technical Interference Information Blocking\nprovisions as discussed further in section VIII. Certified API Developers must make available\nappropriately scoped service base URLs that can be used by patients to access their EHI for\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10).\niv. Providing (g)(10)-Certified APIs to API Data Providers\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7494 in § 170.404(b)(3) that an API Technology Supplier with\nHealth IT Modules previously certified to § 170.315(g)(8) must provide all API Data Providers\nHealth IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) within 24 months of this final rule’s effective\ndate.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of comments received urged ONC to extend the timeline\nbeyond the 24 months proposed. Many commenters requested separate timelines for developers\nand providers. Several commenters recommended 36 months. Some commenters offered\nalternatives ideas for timelines, including a stepwise approach, or ONC only determining\ntechnical timelines, and allowing CMS to cover provider timelines. Only a few commenters\nencouraged faster adoption.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback on our proposal. Given the reduced\nscope of the overall updates required by this final rule, our belief that the industry is well-\nprepared to meet this certification criterion’s requirements once the final rule is published, and\nthe Cure’s Act expectation that secure, standards-based APIs would be made available in a\ntimely manner, we have retained a 24 month compliance timeline, which will start from the\npublication date of the final rule. At that point, it will be approximately five years since the Cures\n\n\n\n\nAct’s passage and we believe its implementation should not be delayed any further. We also\nremind stakeholders that this is within 24 months of this rule’s publication compliance date for\nsupplying all API Information Sources with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10)\nenables Certified API Developers (based on their client base and IT architecture) to determine\nthe most appropriate timeline for development, testing, certification, and product release cycles.\n\nThus, we have finalized in § 170.404(b)(3) that a Certified API Developer with certified API\ntechnology previously certified to the certification criterion at § 170.315(g)(8) must provide all\nAPI Information Sources with such certified API technology deployed with certified API\ntechnology certified to the certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) within 24 months of the\npublication date of the final rule.\nv. Compliance for Existing Certified API Technology\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7486 that API Technology Suppliers with Health IT Modules\ncertified to § 170.315(g)(7), (8), or (9) must revise their existing API documentation\nwithin six months from the final rule’s effective date.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters supported the requirement to revise existing API\ndocumentation within six months of the final rule’s effective date. Others requested more time to\nallow documentation and all other websites to come into alignment before enforcement of this\nCondition of Certification requirement. One commenter requested clarification on which\ndocumentation requires revision within the six-month timeframe.\n\n*Response.* In order to align the API Condition of Certification requirements policies, we\nhave broadened the scope of the provision finalized in § 170.404(b)(4) to apply to all API\nCondition of Certification requirements finalized in § 170.404(a), including § 170.404(a)(1)\nthrough (4). Given the change of scope, we renamed this section to “Compliance for existing\ncertified API technology.” We considered commenters’ request for more time, but given the\n\n\n\n\nalready delayed effective date of Part 170 we believed the proposed time of six months sufficient\nto enable Certified API Developers to become compliant with the Condition of Certification\nrequirements finalized in § 170.404(a). This additional time provides Certified API Developers\nwith Health IT Modules already certified to § 170.315(g)(7), (8), or (9) a total of eight months\nfrom the final rule’s publication to update their policies and documentation to comply with the\nrequirements finalized in § 170.404(a). We did not allow a longer time period than six months in\n§ 170.404(b)(4) due to the fact that we have finalized our proposal in § 170.404(b)(3) to require\nCertified API Developers with Health IT Modules previously certified to the certification\ncriterion in 170.315(g)(8) to provide § 170.315(g)(10)-certified APIs to API Information Sources\nwithin 24 months of final rule’s publication date. These policies finalized in § 170.404(b)(4)\nprovide API Information Sources with Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(8) with 18\nmonths of updated documentation before the new requirements finalized in § 170.404(b)(3)\nbecome effective. Setting a more delayed compliance date than the one finalized in §\n170.404(b)(4) would have unreasonably delayed and ultimately diminished the benefits of the\nProgram requirements we have finalized in this rule. In summary, we finalized in §\n170.404(b)(4) that Certified API Developers with Health IT Modules certified to §\n170.315(g)(7), (8), or (9) must comply with § 170.404(a) no later than six months after this final\nrule is published in the Federal register, including by revising their existing business and\ntechnical API documentation and making such documentation available via a publicly accessible\nhyperlink that allows any person to directly access the information without any preconditions or\nadditional steps.\n\n5. Real World Testing\nThe Cures Act requires, as Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements\nunder the Program, that health IT developers successfully test the real world use of the\n\n\n\n\ntechnology for interoperability107\nin the type of setting in which such technology would be\nmarketed. As discussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7495), the objective of real world testing is\nto verify the extent to which certified health IT deployed in production contexts continues to\ndemonstrate conformance to the full scope of applicable certification criteria and functions with\nthe intended use cases as part of the overall maintenance of a health IT’s certification. Real\nworld testing should assess that the certified health IT is meeting the intended use case(s) of the\ncertification criteria to which it is certified within the workflows, system architectures, and\ntype(s) of care setting(s) for which it is marketed (advertised, promoted, or sold).\n\nFor the purpose of this Condition of Certification requirement, in § 170.405(a), we\nproposed (84 FR 7495) that successful real world testing means:\n The certified health IT continues to be compliant to the full scope of the certification\ncriteria to which it is certified, including the required technical standards and vocabulary\ncodes sets;\n The certified health IT is exchanging electronic health information in the care and practice\nsettings for which it is intended for use; and\n Electronic health information is received by and used in the certified health IT.\n\nTo fully implement the real world testing Condition of Certification requirement, we\nproposed Maintenance of Certification requirements that would require health IT developers to\nsubmit publicly available prospective annual real world testing plans and retrospective annual\nreal world testing results for the certification criteria focused on interoperability to which each of\nits Health IT Modules is certified (84 FR 7496).\n\n*Comments.* Comments on the whole support the establishment of a robust process of real\n107\nDefined in statute in section 3000 of the Public Health Service Act (as modified by section 4003 of the Cures\nAct) and defined in regulation at 45 CFR 170.102.\n\n\n\n\nworld testing. Several commenters expressed concerns regarding the quality and usability of\nhealth IT. Specifically, commenters indicated that issues related to health IT usability may be\ncontributing to clinician burn-out or impacting patient safety, noting that they therefore strongly\nsupport the inclusion of robust real world testing requirements.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all comments, and have finalized real world testing Condition\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.405(a) and (b) as proposed, with minor\nadjustments to due dates and clarifications of several points in response to specific comments as\ndiscussed below.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters indicated that additional clarification of the real world testing\nrequirements would make these Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements less\nburdensome to implement. These commenters specifically sought additional guidance around the\nexpectations for an appropriate testing plan and method of execution. One commenter\nrecommended that ONC provide more guidance around what care settings must be covered by\ntest plans, and establish a minimum number of settings and test sites that are applicable for\ncertified Health IT Modules.\n\n*Response.* In response to comments requesting additional guidance around expectations\nand acceptable methods for real world testing, we provide below additional discussion,\nexplanation, and illustrative examples. At this time, we have decided not to establish a minimum\nnumber of settings or minimum percentage or fraction of production instances of the developer’s\napplicable certified Health IT Modules that must be included in the developer’s annual real\nworld testing activities. While health IT developers are not required to test their certified health\nIT in each and every setting in which it is intended for use, we would expect a developer’s real\nworld testing plan to address each type of clinical setting for which their health IT is marketed.\n\nDevelopers must address in their real world testing plans their choice of care and/or practice\n\n\n\n\nsettings to test and provide a justification for their chosen approach. We also remind developers\nthat although we are not requiring testing in every setting for which the certified health IT is\nmarketed, we encourage real world testing in as many specific settings as feasible within each\ntype of setting for which the certified health IT is marketed.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed a view that there has been too much focus on\nthe export capabilities of systems and not enough attention paid to providers being able to ingest\ndata received in standardized formats—such as the Continuity of Care Document (CCD)\nstandard—from other providers, including other providers who use the same developer’s Health\nIT Modules certified to produce exports in conformance with the standards.\n\n*Response.* The interoperability focused criteria listed in § 170.405(a) include required\ncapabilities for receiving and incorporating data in accordance with referenced standards and\nimplementation specifications adopted by the Secretary in part 170 subpart B. We believe this\nappropriately aligns requirements for real world testing of Health IT Modules’ ability to ingest\ndata with the capabilities their certifications address.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended that, for real world testing of Health IT Modules\ncertified to the API criterion, the final rule require health IT developers to provide a testing\nenvironment (or “developer sandbox”) and require the use of a testing platform and test scripts\nthat validate the ability of the API to meet the underlying requirements for the version of FHIR®\nto which Health IT Module(s) are certified, any applicable FHIR® profiles, and implementation\nguides.\n\n*Response.* As discussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7496), we believe health IT\ndevelopers are in the best position to design and facilitate implementation of real world testing\napproaches that balance the burdens of this statutory requirement with its intended assurances\nthat certified health IT as deployed in the types of clinical settings for which it is marketed\n\n\n\n\n(advertised, promoted, or sold) continues to meet the Program requirements, including but not\nlimited to interoperability performance, applicable under the certification it holds. While we\nrecognize that testing environments can be useful for a variety of purposes, and would not\ngenerally discourage developers from offering test platforms specific to their products or\nparticipating in the development and use of open-source testing platforms, the purpose of real\nworld testing is to demonstrate that Health IT Modules continue to perform in conformance to\ntheir certification when and as they are deployed in production environments supporting the\ntypes of clinical settings for which the Health IT Modules are marketed. Thus, real patient data\nand real production environments will in most cases best meet that need and should be first\nconsidered when developing real world testing plans. Mandating creation or use of testing\nenvironments for real world testing would compete for developers’ time and effort with the focus\non innovative ways to best serve the purpose of the real world testing Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements at the least burden on their customers and end users.\n\nWe have therefore not required health IT developers to provide a testing environment (or\n“developer sandbox”) nor have we required the use of a testing platform or test scripts in order to\nsatisfy real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that ONC be mindful of the burdens this\ntesting could place on health care providers in terms of time and cost and take all necessary steps\nto minimize such burdens. Commenters specifically stated real world testing would require\nsignificant work by providers for whom, in the commenters’ stated view, there is no incentive to\nparticipate in real world testing. Some commenters specifically recommended that HHS\nincentivize providers to participate, stating that without providers’ participation, this proposal\nwould become an untenable requirement. One commenter requested HHS clarify whether a\ndeveloper would be permitted to compensate its customers for the time the customer spends\n\n\n\n\nsupporting the developer’s real world testing activities.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback noting the potential for health IT\ndevelopers’ real world testing activities to impose burden on providers. We do appreciate the\nimportance of recognizing that providers engage directly and actively in various types of\nactivities supporting advancement of health IT. The fact that many of these activities could be\nincluded in robust real world testing regimes suggests that we should provide developers with\nextensive flexibility to develop innovative real world testing plans. We have therefore built into\nour real world testing policy flexibility that offers the developer a substantial opportunity to\ndesign real world testing approaches that minimize burden and fully optimize value of the real\nworld testing activities and results to current and prospective customers. We do not believe that\nHHS incentives to providers participating in real world testing would be the most effective\nmeans of alleviating burdens on health care providers specifically attributable to developers’ real\nworld testing activities. Rather, the flexibility of our policy allows for, and encourages,\ndevelopers to approach real world testing in an innovative mode so that they can maximize\nefficiency and minimize burden of real world testing for both the developer and its customers. A\nwide range of practical strategies are available for developers to potentially consider in creating\nsuch optimized solutions for real world testing of their specific health IT with their particular\ncustomer base. Examples of this range of practical strategies include, but are not necessarily\nlimited to: avoiding some activities that satisfy only the real world testing Maintenance of\nCertification requirements by including in its overall real world testing plans the testing typically\nassociated with confirming functionality of new installations and upgrades of their software; and\ninnovating methods of measuring products’ performance in real time use through system\nmetadata and/or feedback from health information networks and other exchange partners of their\ncustomers.\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the recommendation that developers be allowed to compensate their\ncustomers for participating in the developer’s real world testing activities, we note that nothing\nin our proposed or finalized policy under part 170 would prohibit that. In the event a developer\nconcludes that its real world testing approach imposes on its customers directly participating in\nreal world testing activities a burden that the developer would like to offset for those customers,\nwe would not discourage the developer from considering whether there may be opportunities\nwithin the bounds of other applicable laws or regulations for developers of certified health IT to\noffer customers some types of burden-offsetting compensation or other incentive for real world\ntesting participation. Analysis, interpretation, or changes to such other law or regulation is\noutside the scope of this particular rulemaking action. Moreover, outside the rulemaking process,\ndevelopers should be aware that ONC is not in a position to provide general guidance on Federal\nlaws specific to compensation arrangements or advice specific to any particular circumstances or\ncontemplated conduct related to developers compensating providers for participating in\ndevelopers’ real world testing activities. However, if developers or providers may be\ncontemplating a potential compensation arrangement related to offsetting providers’ cost or\nburden of engagement in developers’ real world testing, we offer as a point of information that\none publicly stated purpose of the HHS Office of the Inspector General advisory opinion process\nis to provide meaningful advice about of the applicability of the anti-kickback statute or other\nOIG sanction statutes in specific factual situations.108\nComments. One commenter expressed concern that developers with small customer bases\nwill have smaller pools of participants willing to undergo a lengthy process which will require\nsignificant resources and suggested developers submit results from a more limited scope of\n108\nFor more information about HHS Office of the Inspector General advisory opinions and advisory opinion\nprocess, please visit: https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/advisory-opinions/index.asp\n\n\n\n\ntesting only every three years.\n\n*Response.* We reiterate that the policy we have finalized includes substantial flexibility\nfor developers to assess how to meet the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements in a way that appropriately minimizes burden on the current users of\ntheir certified health IT.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter expressed concern that health care providers might be\nunwilling to use health IT that had not yet been certified, and that this could make real world\ntesting of Health IT Modules prior to certification impractical.\n\n*Response.* In our Proposed Rule (84 FR 7429), we proposed in § 170.405(a) to limit the\napplicability of this Condition of Certification to health IT developers with Health IT Modules\nthat are certified to one or more 2015 Edition certification criteria focused on interoperability and\ndata exchange. We also proposed that the real world testing Condition of Certification would be\nmet through meeting the real world testing Maintenance of Certification requirements in §\n170.405(b). We have finalized this proposal as proposed. Thus, the real world testing Condition\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements do not mandate testing real world use of a Health\nIT Module in actual production environments before it is certified.\na. Unit of Analysis at which Testing Requirements Apply\nComments. One commenter requested confirmation if real world testing is required per\nCHPL listing, per product, or per company.\n\n*Response.* The real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements apply to each developer that has at least one Health IT Module certified to at least\none of the interoperability and exchange focused criteria listed in § 170.405(a), because\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements apply to the developer of certified\nhealth IT. However, each developer of certified health IT to which the real world testing\n\n\n\n\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements apply must conduct real world testing\nfor each criterion within the scope of real world testing (§ 170.405(a)) to which each developer\npresents for certification a Health IT Module that is part of a health IT product to be listed on the\nCHPL are certified. A health IT developer with multiple products that are listed on the CHPL\nand that include one or more Health IT Module(s) certified to one or more of the criteria listed in\n§ 170.405(a) need only submit one real world testing plan, and one real world testing results\nreport, for any given annual cycle of real world testing, but the real world testing plan and results\nreport must address each of the developer’s products that is listed on the CHPL. Health IT\ndevelopers with multiple health IT products that may include the same Health IT Module(s)\ncertified to one or more of the criteria listed in 170.405(a) have discretion to design their real\nworld testing plans in a way that efficiently tests a combination of products that include Health\nIT Modules certified criteria listed in § 170.405(a) so long as testing plans and results are\ntraceable to specific certified Health IT Modules and each criterion to which the Health IT\nModule(s) are certified, and address the types of settings for which the products are marketed.\n\nBecause the purpose of real world testing is to test health IT products as they are deployed in\nproduction, developers of health IT products deployed through the cloud who offer their products\nfor multiple types of clinical settings will be required to test the same capability for those\ndifferent types of settings even if it uses a single instance of the deployed capability to serve all\nof those types of settings.\nb. Applicability of Real World Testing Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification Requirements\nWe proposed (84 FR 7495) to limit the applicability of the real world testing Condition of\nCertification requirement to health IT developers with Health IT Modules certified to one or\nmore of the certification criteria focused on interoperability and data exchange or availability\n\n\n\n\nlisted in (then-proposed) § 170.405(a):\n The care coordination criteria in § 170.315(b);\n The clinical quality measures (CQMs) criteria in § 170.315(c)(1) through (c)(3);\n The “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” criterion in § 170.315(e)(1);\n The public health criteria in § 170.315(f);\n The application programming interface criteria in § 170.315(g)(7) through\n(g)(10); and\n The transport methods and other protocols criteria in § 170.315(h).\n\nWe solicited comment on whether to also include the “patient health information capture”\ncertification criteria in § 170.315(e)(3), including the value of real world testing these\nfunctionalities compared to the benefit for interoperability and exchange (84 FR 7496). We also\nsolicited comment on whether any other 2015 Edition certification criteria should be included or\nremoved from the applicability list (to be codified at 170.405(a)) for this Condition of\nCertification requirement.\n\n*Comments.* The vast majority of commenters addressing this proposal were in support of\nthe specific criteria proposed to be within the scope of real world testing and expressed\nagreement that required testing should be limited to Health IT Modules certified to one or more\nof the certification criteria listed in § 170.405(a) as proposed.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all feedback received. The list of criteria to which real world\ntesting Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements apply is finalized in §\n170.405(a) as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment supporting and two comments opposing the\naddition of patient health information capture criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) to the scope of real\n\n\n\n\nworld testing. One commenter specifically recommended against including the patient health\ninformation capture criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) in real world testing because of the significant\nvariability in how health IT certified to this criterion is implemented. They stated that this\nvariability in the real world could make cross-implementation comparisons difficult, and stated\nthat testing for this criterion could present a particular challenge based on difficulty they\nanticipated would be encountered in securing needed engagement from patients as well as the\nexchange partners who would presumably receive the data as a result of the patient using the\n“transmit” functionality. Commenters opposed to addition of this criterion to the real world\ntesting Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements also stated this addition would\nadd cost to the developer which would then flow down to end users and be burdensome to\nclinician practices.\n\n*Response.* On balance, the comments received do not support expansion of the scope of\nreal world testing requirements to include the patient health information capture criterion in §\n170.315(e)(3) at this time. In developing the proposed list of criteria to which real world testing\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements would apply, we concluded an initial\nfocus on those particular criteria would strike an appropriate balance between the magnitude of\nthe challenge represented by the new real world testing requirements and the potential benefits of\ntheir broader application. The concerns raised by the commenters recommending against adding\nthe patient health information capture criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) to the scope of real world\ntesting requirements at this time, combined with other comments more generally recommending\nagainst a broader scope at this time, tend to support the conclusion that the scope we proposed\nstrikes an appropriately practical balance until we and the industry have benefit of experience\nand innovation in real world testing. Thus, the finalized list of criteria to which real world testing\nrequirements apply (§ 170.405(a)) does not include the patient health information capture\n\n\n\n\ncriterion in § 170.315(e)(3).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters suggested expanding the scope of real world testing\nrequirements to include the proposed “EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the confirmation that commenters supported inclusion of the\n“EHI export” criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) alongside the rest of the care coordination criteria in §\n170.315(b). We have finalized the criteria listed in § 170.405(a) including, as proposed, all\ncriteria within § 170.315(b).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed an opinion that the initial scope of criteria is more\nexpansive than the commenter would suggest for an introductory set, and asked that fewer\ncriteria be required for the initial rollout of real world testing, delaying application of the\nrequirement to more interoperability focused criteria until experience has been amassed with real\nworld testing for a narrower selection of criteria than we had proposed.\n\n*Response.* Noting that the majority of comments received were supportive of the scope as\nproposed, we also balance suggestions such as that offered by this commenter against the\nProgram’s needs and the purpose of the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements. We do not believe it would be in the best interest of the Program or\nthe health care providers and patients who rely on certified health IT to meet their needs for\ninteroperable health IT to narrow the applicability of the real world testing Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements further than we proposed. We have, therefore,\nfinalized the criteria listed in § 170.405(a) as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters advocated expanding the scope of the real world testing\nrequirement to include select functionally-based “clinical” criteria within § 170.315(a) that are\nincluded in the base EHR definition.\n\n*Response.* As explained in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7495), we did not propose to\n\n\n\n\ninclude in the scope of real world testing functionally-based criteria, administrative criteria, or\nother criteria that do not focus on interoperability and exchange or availability of data. The\n“clinical” certification criteria in § 170.315(a) were noted in the Proposed Rule as an example of\ncriteria not proposed because they require only that the health IT enable the provider to record,\nchange, and access specific types of data within the Health IT Module being certified (or within\na product that includes the Health IT Module being certified to the particular criteria). However,\nreal world testing of health IT’s ability to exchange the types of data these clinical criteria\nreference is addressed through the inclusion of the USCDI in the interoperability-focused criteria\nlisted in § 170.405(a) as proposed, which is finalized as proposed. In order to successfully\nexchange interoperable EHI, the health IT must be able to access it, and in order to incorporate a\ntype of data, the health IT must be able to record it.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of comments received specifically referencing the proposed\ninclusion of public health criteria in the real world testing requirement in § 170.405(a) support\nthe importance and inclusion of the public health criteria in the scope of real world testing\nrequirements. One commenter questioned the inclusion of the public health criteria in §\n170.315(f), stating the commenter’s perception that extensive variation between registries would\nmake this a challenging functionality to demonstrate.\n\n*Response.* Variations in system configurations across different public health agencies’\ninfrastructures may suggest different real world testing strategies may be most appropriate, or\nmost relevant to customers, compared to what might be the case for some other criteria within\nthe scope of real world testing. However, as noted below about testing tools, we are aware of a\nwide variety of resources and opportunities to test real world interoperability performance of\nHealth IT Modules certified to the public health criteria in § 170.315(f). Because interoperability\nperformance in actual production environments is an important feature of health IT certified to\n\n\n\n\nthe public health criteria in § 170.315(f), and noting the support for its inclusion expressed by\nmost commenters, and we have determined that the most appropriate course is to finalize the\ninclusion of the public health criteria in§ 170.315(f) in the scope of real world testing in §\n170.405(a).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that some of the criteria proposed for\ninclusion in § 170.405(a) be re-examined because they do not include all three of the\ncharacteristics our Proposed Rule described as being demonstrated through real world testing.\n\nExamples offered included that some criteria proposed for inclusion in § 170.405(a) require\nexporting but do not require receipt and use of electronic health information by the certified\nhealth IT.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ bringing to our attention that additional discussion\nabout the requirements would be helpful to the community. For the criteria proposed and\nfinalized in the real world testing scope in § 170.405(a), such real world testing needs to address\nthe interoperability characteristics and all other functionalities and capabilities applicable based\non the specific criteria to which the Health IT Module is certified. For example, even if a Health\nIT Module is not certified to any criterion that specifically requires it to demonstrate, in order to\nbe certified, that the Health IT Module has the capability to incorporate and use data received\ndirectly from sources outside the production environment in which it is deployed, that Health IT\nModule will still need to demonstrate conformance to the full scope of each criterion to which it\nis certified. This includes, though it is not limited to, the technical standards and vocabulary\ncodes sets included in each criterion to which it certified.\nc. Testing Plans, Methods, and Results Reporting\nWe proposed (84 FR 7496) that a health IT developers must submit an annual real world\ntesting plan to its ONC-ACB via a publicly accessible hyperlink no later than December 15, of\n\n\n\n\neach calendar year for each of its certified Health IT Modules that include certification criteria\nspecified for this Condition of Certification. We proposed (84 FR 7497) that a health IT\ndeveloper must submit an annual real world testing plan to its ONC-ACB via a publicly\naccessible hyperlink no later than January 31, of each calendar year for the preceding calendar\nyear’s real world testing.\n\nWe proposed that the real world testing plan, which will be required to be available to\nONC and the public via the CHPL no later than December 15 of each year once this final rule is\neffective, will need to address the health IT developer’s real world testing that will be conducted\nthe upcoming calendar year and must include, for each of the certification criteria in scope for real\nworld testing in § 170.405(a) and each Health IT Module certified to one or more of these criteria\n(84 FR 7496):\n The testing method(s)/methodology(ies) that will be used to demonstrate real world\ninteroperability, including a mandatory focus on scenario- and use case-focused\ntesting;\n The care and practice setting(s) that will be tested for real world interoperability,\nincluding conformance to the full scope of the certification criteria requirements, and\nan explanation for the health IT developer’s choice of care setting(s) to test;109\n The timeline and plans for voluntary updates to standards and implementation\nspecifications that ONC has approved (further discussed below);\n A schedule of key real world testing milestones;\n109\nWe do not specifically define or limit the care settings and leave it to the health IT developer to determine. As an\nexample, health IT developers can consider categories, including but not limited to, those used in the EHR Incentive\nPrograms (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-\nGuidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/UserGuide_QNetHospitalObjectivesCQMs.pdf); long-\nterm and post-acute care; pediatrics; behavioral health; and small, rural, and underserved settings.\n\n\n\n\n A description of the expected outcomes of real world testing;\n At least one measurement/metric associated with the real world testing for each\ncertification in scope; and\n A justification for the health IT developer’s real world testing approach.\n\nWe sought comment (84 FR 7497) on whether we should specify a minimum “core” set\nof metrics/measurements and examples of suggested metrics/measurements as well as on the\ntiming of required real world testing results reporting. We also invited comment on the annual\nfrequency and timing of required real world testing results reporting.\n\n*Comments.* Most comments received supported the proposed requirement for Health IT\nModules to undergo real world testing. In addition, commenters indicated that real world testing\nshould occur on a regular basis to ensure various types of changes in the Health IT Modules or\nproduction environments have not affected functionality required by the certification. Several\ncommenters recommended development of more specific minimum requirements for test plans\nand measurement of results. They further recommended that ONC provide additional guidance\nabout what will constitute a minimally acceptable testing plan with explicit content depicting the\nminimum requirements for each component of the testing plan.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. As discussed in the Proposed Rule\nand above, we believe health IT developers are in the best position to design and facilitate\nimplementation of real world testing approaches that balance the burdens of this statutory\nrequirement with its intended assurances that certified health IT meets Program requirements,\nincluding interoperability performance, applicable under the certification it holds. We have\ntherefore finalized requirements in § 170.405(b)(1) designed to avoid the risk of a “one size fits\nall” set of testing tools (discussed at 84 FR 7496) that might not fully address the concerns raised\nor provide the assurances of interoperability performance sought across the various types of care\n\n\n\n\nsettings. By establishing in § 170.405(b)(1)(iii) the topics and considerations every developer\nmust address in its required real world testing plan but not specifying how they must address\nthese required aspects we have provided health IT developers with a requirement that at the same\ntime provides them with the flexibility to develop and implement successful real world testing\nplans that will best balance burden and value for the customers of each of their products. The\nONC-ACBs will be responsible for assessing real world testing plans and results reports for\ncompleteness in comparison to what § 171.405(b)(1) requires the plan and results reports to\ninclude or address, but will otherwise not be formally evaluating the testing approach for quality\nas a testing approach. We note for clarity that while ONC-ACB’s will not be judging a\ndeveloper’s real world testing approaches as planned or as executed, the contents of a\ndeveloper’s publicly available real world testing results could be used by an ONC-ACB as part\nof its ongoing surveillance of certified health IT. Additionally, we have finalized our proposed\nrequirement in § 170.405(a) and (b) that requires developers subject to the real world testing\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (see § 170.405(b)(2)(i)) who discover\nin the course of their real world testing any non-conformities with the standards, functionalities,\nor other requirements of any certification criterion under the Program, to address these non-\nconformities in order for their Health IT Modules to remain certified. This requirement will\napply in the same manner to Health IT Modules certified under the SVAP flexibility in §\n170.405(b)(8) or (9) as to Health IT Modules not certified under the SVAP flexibility. Thus,\ndevelopers who discover non-conformity to any Program requirement(s) will be required to\nreport those non-conformities to their ONC-ACB(s). In order to provide a clear threshold for\ndetermining whether a developer has acted on this requirement in a timely manner, we have\nfinalized the requirement to report non-conformities within 30 days of discovering them (see §\n170.405(b)(2)(i)). We believe 30 days is an appropriate timeframe to allow developers the\n\n\n\n\nopportunity to gather all facts and report to their ONC-ACBs the details and nature of the non-\nconformity. Furthermore, we believe more than the 30 days would extend beyond the timeframe\nby which a non-conformity should be investigated by an ONC-ACB and corrective action\nimplemented, if necessary.\n\nWe are aware that by choosing not to specify particular methods, tools, or checklists of\nactivities that must be included in real world testing, and providing instead extensive flexibility\nfor developers to select tools and design overall methodologies based on their knowledge of their\nproducts and customers, we are asking developers to apply innovation and problem solving skills\nto their real world testing. We believe that the alternative of developing a catalog of detailed\nspecifications and checklists, as some commenters suggested, would be undesirably complex,\nless supportive of ongoing innovation in the market, and not ultimately less burdensome for\ndevelopers or their customers. As we have noted in the context of prior Program rulemaking\nactions, we often make additional information resources and non-binding guidance regarding real\nworld testing available through familiar communications channels, such as the HealthIT.gov\nwebsite.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns about the burden of real world\ntesting in specific reference to ONC-ACB processes for in-the-field surveillance of certified\nproducts’ continued conformance to applicable certification criteria. Some comments raised\nconcerns about the burden that could be placed on developers’ customers should developers\nchoose to rely heavily on the procedures used by ONC-ACBs for randomized or reactive in-the-\nfield surveillance. Some comments indicated concern that ONC would expect, encourage, or\nview more favorably real world testing approaches that rely heavily or exclusively on use of\nONC-ACB in-the-field surveillance protocols.\n\n*Response.* In the Proposed Rule, we stated that “developers may consider working with\n\n\n\n\nan ONC-ACB and have the ONC-ACB oversee the execution of the health IT developer’s real\nworld testing plans, which could include in-the-field surveillance per § 170.556, as an acceptable\napproach to meet the requirements of the real world testing Condition of Certification”\nrequirement (84 FR 7497). Having considered all comments received, we have decided not to\nfinalize the flexibility for developers to use ONC-ACBs’ in-the-field surveillance as part of the\ndeveloper’s real world testing plan. We do not believe that use or replication of methods or\nprotocols used by ONC-ACBs for in-the-field surveillance of certified Health IT Modules would\nbe the most effective or the least burdensome approach available to health IT developers and are\nconcerned accepting real world testing approaches that rely on ONC-ACB in-the-field\nsurveillance could slow rather than accelerate development of more innovative approaches to\nreal world testing. We are also concerned that inclusion of ONC-ACB execution of in-the-field\nsurveillance within a developer’s real world testing approach could lead to confusion as to\nwhether the organization that is an ONC-ACB was applying in-the-field surveillance protocols in\nits capacity as an ONC-ACB as part of its oversight responsibilities on behalf of ONC or in its\nprivate capacity on behalf of the health IT developer. We believe it is important, to protect\nHIPAA covered health care providers and other HIPAA covered entities and their business\nassociates from inadvertently violating requirements related to disclosure of health information,\nto maintain a clear distinction of when an organization that is an ONC-ACB is acting in the\nONC-ACB capacity and when it is acting in its private capacity. We note and emphasize this\nbecause, in the event a developer may choose to engage services in support of developing or\nimplementing the developer’s real world testing plans from an organization or entity that also\nhappens to be an ONC-ACB, all activities undertaken by the organization or entity to develop,\nexecute, or support the development or execution of the developer’s real world testing plan\nwould be activities outside the ONC-ACB role. In such circumstances, the organization that is an\n\n\n\n\nONC-ACB would be acting in a separate, private capacity. Note that an organization providing\nsuch private services that involve ePHI would likely be characterized under the HIPAA Rules as\na business associate to the health care provider and subject to the HIPAA Rules. The oversight\nauthorities attached to its ONC-ACB role would not apply to the organization’s requests to gain\naccess to health care provider facilities or to EHI for purposes of providing these separate\nsupport services to health IT developers for conduct of the developers’ real world testing.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters sought confirmation that a test server could be used for\nreal world testing instead of a production environment, given the permissible use of synthetic\ndata.\n\n*Response.* After considering the totality of comments received, we have decided to\nfinalize that a test server could be used for real world testing and provide the flexibility included\nin the Proposed Rule that allows for real world testing to occur in a production setting using real\npatient data in accordance with applicable laws as well as in an environment that mirrors a\nspecific production environment used in a type of clinical setting for which the health IT is\nmarketed. We have also decided to finalize the flexibility for the developer to use synthetic\npatient data in lieu of or in addition to real patient data in real or simulated/test scenarios\nexecuted in environments that mirror production environments where the health IT is deployed.\n\nHowever, we emphasize that the purpose of real world testing is to demonstrate that the Health\nIT Module(s) work as expected in real-life clinical settings. We note, as a point of potential\ninterest for such consideration, that real world testing plans that meet the Program requirement\nmight include observation or measurement of the health IT’s interoperability performance while\nactual scenarios and use cases are executed by end users on real patient data in actual operational\ncontexts. If a developer chooses to use synthetic data, non-production (mirrored) environments,\nor a combination of real and synthetic data or production and mirrored environments, to\n\n\n\n\ncomplete any portion of their annual real world testing requirements, the developer must include\nin their real world testing plan and results submissions a specific explanation justifying how the\nsynthetic data, mirrored environment, or both are appropriate and adequate to meet the real world\ntesting requirement(s) for which they will be or were used.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters sought confirmation that a product serving multiple care\nsettings could complete a single test relevant to all settings and ask ONC to provide a list of\neligible care settings for reference.\n\n*Response.* The finalized real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements include testing each criterion listed in § 170.405(a) to which any Health IT\nModule(s) within the product are certified, and testing in each type of setting to which it is\nmarketed. To satisfy these Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements as finalized,\na single testing plan, protocol, or approach must address all the types of settings to which the\nproduct, with all its included Health IT Module(s), is marketed and do so with traceability to\neach Health IT Module of its real world performance in each type of setting for which it is\nmarketed. We believe it is possible to construct a real world use scenario or use case that tests\nmore than one type of setting applicable to the Health IT Module, and confirm that a developer is\nnot required to develop unnecessarily or artificially separate scenarios or use cases across\nmultiple types of settings to which a given developer markets its applicable Health IT Module(s).\n\nWith respect to the types of settings required to be addressed by a given developer’s plan, we do\nnot believe that additional specification is necessary because we believe each developer is well\nsituated to know for what types of settings the developer (or its authorized resellers) has\nmarketed, is marketing, or intends to market its Health IT Modules. For purposes of this\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirement as finalized, there is no exclusion for\nsettings or health care provider types based on their inclusion or lack of inclusion in, or\n\n\n\n\neligibility or ineligibility for, and particular Federal health care program or initiative. Therefore,\nthe types of settings eligible to be addressed in a developer’s real world testing plan for a given\nyear include all those to which product(s) including one or more Health IT Modules certified to\none or more of the criteria listed at § 170.405(a) as of August 31 of the year in which that\nspecific annual real world testing plan is due have been or are marketed when the real world\ntesting plan is submitted, and/or the types of settings for which the developer anticipates\nmarketing such product(s) in time to include them in a specific year’s real world testing\nactivities.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested ONC ensure that real world testing\nrequirements do not create infrastructure for testing of public health transactions without public\nhealth involvement. Several commenters noted that public health organizations and many public\nhealth agencies already offer resources and processes used in onboarding processes for public\nhealth reporting connections and suggested these resources and processes could be used more\nbroadly to test health IT’s real world performance on public health interoperability criteria rather\nthan requiring creation of new or different tools.\n\n*Response.* We would tend to agree that relying for specific use cases on testing\ninfrastructures developed without appropriate involvement of key participants in the use case\nwould not be an optimal approach. Also, we reiterate that we encourage developers to consider a\nvariety of options and approaches before finalizing their annual real world testing plans. We\nwould encourage developers to consider the real world testing potential of resources, tooling, and\ninfrastructure already offered by public health organizations and agencies before embarking on\nefforts to develop additional tooling. We also note that, for the interoperability-focused public\nhealth criteria, alternatives that would avoid both overuse of simulation environments and asking\npublic health agencies to engage in work unique to developers’ real world testing plans might\n\n\n\n\ninclude structured observation and measurement of interoperability performance in actual public\nhealth data reporting/exchange as well as the testing ordinarily conducted for\nonboarding/confirming connectivity of newly deployed/upgraded implementations to public\nhealth data exchange infrastructures.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed support of requiring the use of\nmetrics/measurements for real world testing. One commenter stated that ONC should not allow\njust one measurement to suffice for real world testing of interoperability of a Health IT Module.\n\nSeveral commenters recommended ONC include a description of “measurement,” provide clarity\non the role of measurement, and provide a “sample” or suggested set of metrics/measurements to\nhelp foster alignment of reporting around meaningful common metrics/measurements across\ndevelopers. Some commenters recommended ONC identify a core set of metrics/measures that\ndevelopers would be required to include, or from which developers would be required to select\nspecific metrics/measures to include, in their real world testing plans. Other commenters\nadvocated against developers being required to submit testing results for a minimum “core” set\nof general metrics, providing the rationale that not all metrics will be available to all systems\nuniformly and suggesting that many metrics are retained in the provider’s locally integrated\nproduction systems and unavailable to the developer of any given Module(s) without\nconsiderable effort to retrieve the data. One commenter recommended requiring that each\ndeveloper’s real world test plan include measures addressing all of the domains of the NQF\nreport: Measurement Framework to Assess Nationwide Progress Related to Interoperable Health\nInformation Exchange to Support the National Quality Strategy.110\nResponse. The comments on real world testing did not show clear, widespread support\n110\nhttps://www.qualityforum.org/Projects/i-m/Interoperability_2016-2017/Key_Informant_Summary_Report.aspx\n(last accessed 12/17/2019).\n\n\n\n\nfor any specific subset of available metrics as a “core” set or catalog that a significant portion of\nthe affected communities (health IT developers, health care providers, and public health\nagencies) would generally agree should be consistently used across all developers’ real world\ntesting plans. Thus, we have finalized the real world testing plan requirements (see §\n170.405(b)(1)(iii) and real world testing results reporting requirements (see § 170.405(b)(2)(ii))\nwithout identifying a minimum set of measures that must be used or a catalog of suggested\nmeasures from which a developer would be expected to choose in constructing its real world\ntesting plans. We reiterate that each developer must choose a measurement approach, including\nat least one measurement/metric per applicable criterion, for use in each year’s real world\ntesting and explain the selection and relevance of its selected measures/metrics within its\njustification for its real world testing approach in that year’s plan and results report.\n\n*Comments.* Comments were received on the frequency and timing of real world testing.\n\nOne commenter stated the policy should not require annual testing if the capability certified for a\ngiven criterion remains unchanged year to year, offering the example that if a Health IT Module\nis certified for both § 170.315(b)(1) and (b)(2) and the developer is planning to release material\nupdates to the capabilities specific to § 170.315(b)(1), but not make any material changes\nspecific to the Module’s certification to § 170.315(b)(2), this commenter would prefer that the\nHealth IT Module would need to submit a testing plan and subsequent results addressing only the\n§ 170.315(b)(1) criterion for the year the change is made. Another commenter expressed\nskepticism regarding the value of annual real world testing requirements, expressing a preference\nfor an approach that developers would, after an initial cycle of post-certification real world\ntesting of a Health IT Module, be required to re-test only when updating to National\nCoordinator-approved newer versions of adopted standards included in applicable criteria or\nwhen making major functional updates to the certified Health IT Module. One commenter who\n\n\n\n\nwas overall not supportive of the real world testing requirement stated that developers would\nneed a two-year cycle instead of a one-year cycle in order to adequately demonstrate compliance\nwith full functionality testing. One commenter specifically expressed support for the annual\nfrequency and timing of required real world testing results reporting.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenters for their feedback regarding the frequency and\ntiming of real world testing. We have finalized the requirement for annual testing in §\n170.405(b)(1). Ongoing annual testing is needed to ensure that Health IT Module(s) continue to\nperform as intended in the types of settings where patients and health care providers continue to\nrely on it to meet their interoperability needs.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support of the proposed real world testing plan\nrequirements and requested we strengthen this provision to require that developers test their\nproducts within each clinical specialty to which the technology would be marketed. One\ncommenter requested that we define with more particularity what is expected of developers\nduring the testing to account for the differing conditions under which Health IT Modules are\ndeployed, and how for example, the system works particular conditions like server degradation.\n\nSeveral other commenters suggested we provide a standardized template for use in developing\ntest plans. Commenters described a template would include all required testing elements and\npromote greater consistency in the way the test plans are written by the various developers.\n\n*Response.* For reasons stated in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7496) and above, we do not\nbelieve a centrally developed or standardized approach for real world testing plans is the most\nappropriate solution at this time. By centrally mandating or endorsing a single template in the\ninterest of consistently formatted documentation, we are concerned that we might inadvertently\ndiscourage innovation in both testing approaches and their communication to the customer\ncommunity. What the plan must include or address for each applicable criterion to which the\n\n\n\n\ndeveloper’s Health IT Module(s) are certified is outlined in § 170.405(b)(1)(iii), as finalized by\nthis rule. We believe the plan requirements finalized in the plan requirements in § 170.405(b) are\nspecific enough to ensure the plans can be completed by developers and effectively reviewed for\ncompleteness by ONC-ACBs, and that both the substance and clarity or efficacy of presentation\ncan both be examined and considered by any interested parties -- from health care providers to\ninformatics and interoperability researchers. Because individual circumstances and needs may\nvary even within the same type of setting or clinician specialty, it would be not be possible at this\ntime to define a real world testing regime that eliminated all of the variability developers may\nhave in implementing their real world testing plans.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter sought clarification on the total minimum number of metrics\nrequired for a developer’s real world testing plan to be considered complete and in compliance\nwith the requirement.\n\n*Response.* A developer’s real world testing plan must include at least one metric for each\napplicable certification criteria. To ensure that we are providing clear guidance, we offer the\nfollowing illustrative example: a developer with one Health IT Module that is certified to five\ncriteria would need to include in its real world testing plan at least one specific\nmeasurement/metric associated with the real world testing for each of those five criteria.\n\nDepending on the specific criteria and the developer’s real world testing approach, this could call\nfor up to five different measurements/metrics, or could be addressed with fewer different\nmeasurements/metrics but a specific measurement/metric would need to be identified/attributed\nwithin the plan to each of the applicable certification criteria.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters stated concerns regarding our mandatory focus on\nscenario- and use case-focused testing. One commenter expressed a view that this would be\nexpensive and time consuming, stating that this expense limits scenario- and use case-focused\n\n\n\n\ntesting in the number of settings that can realistically be tested in any given year. One\ncommenter noted that as more settings are tested, fewer scenarios can be run per setting. Two\ncommenters sought more information on the mandatory scenario- and use case-focused testing\nthat will be required, recommending that Health Information Service Providers (HISPs) be able\nto attest to the relevant use cases and provide the proper evidence of testing associated to those\nscenarios.\n\n*Response.* In light of comments received, we can see how our use of terms that are also\nused in the context of ONC-ATL laboratory or ONC-ACB surveillance testing, and our reference\nin one instance to in-the-field surveillance, could have led to an inference that our use of these\nterms implied we would expect to see the same or similar testing protocols used in real world\ntesting. However, we did not propose that real world testing would require developers to set up\nand execute artificial scenarios or activities solely for purposes of testing. In fact, we do not\nencourage use of the laboratory testing or ONC-ACB in-the-field surveillance protocols to\nconduct real world testing, as those particular test methods, tools, and surveillance protocols\nwere not designed and should not be relied upon for real world testing. The testing\nmethods/methodologies need to address realistic scenarios, use cases, and workflows associated\nwith interoperability, and we do expect developers to consider such factors as the size of the\norganization that production systems support, the type of organization and setting, the number of\npatient records and users, system components and integrations, and the volume and types of data\nexchange in planning for real world testing.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed agreement that the developer is best situated to\ndetermine the most effective real world testing plan for their products. One commenter requested\ndevelopers be allowed to work together with their customers to define what real world tests are.\n\n*Response.* The requirements we proposed and finalized provide developers the\n\n\n\n\nopportunity to identify, potentially in partnership with their customers, the real-life scenarios, use\ncases, and work flows applicable to the customer’s day-to-day use of the Health IT Module(s) to\nmeet their interoperability needs in their production environments.\nd. Submission Dates\nWe proposed that a health IT developer must submit an annual real world testing plan to\nits ONC-ACB via a publicly accessible hyperlink for availability to ONC and the public no later\nthan December 15, of each calendar year, and that the plan must address all of its Health IT\nModules certified to the 2015 Edition certification criteria listed in proposed in § 170.405(a) and\n(84 FR 7496). We proposed requiring that prior to submission to the ONC-ACB, the plan will\nneed to be approved by a health IT developer authorized representative capable of binding the\nhealth IT developer for execution of the plan and include the representative’s contact information.\n\nWe proposed that the plan due in any given year will need to include all health IT certified to the\n2015 Edition through August 31 of that year (in other words, the August 31 that immediately\npreceded the December 15 due date).\n\nWe further proposed that a health IT developer would submit annual real world testing\nresults to their ONC-ACBs via a publicly accessible hyperlink no later than January 31 of each\ncalendar year for the real world testing conducted in the preceding calendar year (84 FR 7497).\n\nWe proposed that real world testing results for each certification criterion listed in § 170.405(a)\nwould be required to address the elements required in the previous year’s testing plan, describe\nthe outcomes of real world testing with any challenges encountered, and provide at least one\nmeasurement or metric associated with the real world testing.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concerns that the annual real world testing plan\ndue date falls in December, noting that in addition to multiple holidays widely celebrated in the\nU.S., December can be a busy time for many health IT developers due to various year-end\n\n\n\n\nrequirements and necessary preparations to support customers’ quality measurement data\nsubmissions for CMS programs.\n\n*Response.* We understand the commenters' concern that the proposed real world testing\nplan publication due date falls in the preparatory run-up to year-end deadlines, including for\nmany developers completing preparations to support their customers’ successful clinical quality\nmeasurement data submission during CMS program windows that typically open on the first\nFederal business day in January. In consideration of comments received, we have made edits to\nthe phrasing of the CFR text in § 170.405(b) to convey with more precise clarity that under the\npolicy we have finalized, the developer is required to submit its real world testing plans so that\nthe ONC-ACB can conduct its completeness review and publish the plan hyperlink on CHPL no\nlater than December 15 of each year. This allows for the ONC-ACB and developer to identify\nand agree on the date by which the developer will actually submit its plan to the ONC-ACB,\nwhich could be well in advance of December. One practical implication of the single-deadline\nfeature of the policy as proposed is that in order for the plans to be submitted to ONC and made\npublicly available by the single deadline, the ONC-ACB’s requirement to review plans for\ncompleteness per Program requirements will in many cases mean that the ONC-ACB will need\nthe developer to submit the plan to the ONC-ACB in advance of the single deadline. We have\nfinalized the December 15 due date for real world testing plan publication on CHPL as proposed.\n\nWe have also made clarifying edits to the finalized regulation text (see § 170.405(b)(1)) in\ncomparison to the proposed text to more explicitly recognize the practical implication that the\ndevelopers’ and ONC-ACBs’ responsibility for a single publication date for the plans means that\nthe plan must be submitted by the developer to the ONC-ACB on a date agreed between them\nthat allows for publication by the deadline. We encourage developers and ONC-ACBs to\nconsider allowing at least one calendar month so that the December 15 due date for ONC-ACBs’\n\n\n\n\npublication of real world testing plans will be consistently met. We also note that nothing in §\n170.405 as finalized precludes a developer and ONC-ACB from agreeing on the developer\nsubmitting its annual real world testing plan to the ONC-ACB more than one month prior to\nDecember 15. We have finalized the single plan publication deadline as proposed.\n\nWe did not receive comments specific to August 31 as the annual date when a Health IT\nModule must be certified by in order to be required to be included in the real world testing plan\ndue that year. We have finalized this aspect of our policy as proposed in § 170.405(b)(1)(ii).\n\nThus, developers can submit their real world testing plans as early as September 1 and on a\nrolling basis thereafter for products in scope for the following year, which also addresses\ncommenter concerns.\n\nWe did not receive comments specific to this point, but have removed from § 170.405(b)\nas finalized the language that would have specifically required the initial submission of the plan\nto the ONC-ACB by the developer must be by a publicly accessible hyperlink. While this\nremains an option, and could be the most efficient one for developers and ONC-ACBs in many\ninstances, we believe this is an unnecessarily limiting specification of the manner of interaction\nbetween developers and ONC-ACBs in these instances. The URL or hyperlink in CHPL will not\nbe published on CHPL until the ONC-ACB takes action to publish it, and the ONC-ACB is\nrequired to review the plan and ensure it is complete before publishing the plan link on CHPL.\n\n*Comments.* We received some comments that appeared to construe our intent to be that\nreal world testing for all Health IT Modules certified as of August 31 of a given year would need\nto be planned, conducted, and reported within five months of that date. Comments that appeared\nto be based on this interpretation also expressed concern that this would be too much to\naccomplish on such an annual schedule.\n\n*Response.* We proposed that each developer’s annual real world testing plan required to\n\n\n\n\nbe published by December 15 of a given year would need to address all of the developer’s Health\nIT Modules certified to criteria listed in § 170.405(a) as of August 31 of that year (84 FR 7496).\n\nWe also proposed that this annual real world testing plan would pertain to real world testing\nactivities to be conducted in the year following the December 15 plan publication due date. In\nlight of comments received, we can see how we might have been more precise in how we stated\nthat the annual results report would be due early in the year following the year in which the\ntesting it reported was conducted. The full cycle of real world testing for a given year was never\nspecifically proposed to be contained within a single year, considering that the plan is due in the\nyear prior and the results report was proposed to be due in the year following the one in which a\ngiven annual round of real world testing activity occurs.\n\n*Comments.* Comments raised concerns that the January 31 publication deadline might not\nleave enough time for developers who do not or cannot complete their annual testing activities\nuntil late in the testing year to submit their results reports, and ONC-ACBs complete their\nrequired reviews, prior to the publication deadline. One commenter raised a specific concern that\nthe proposed January 31 due date for real world testing results falls in the submission window for\nseveral CMS programs for which developers’ customers need to submit their clinical quality\nmeasurement data for the preceding year. One commenter recommended leveraging the existing\nquarterly update attestation process and asking developers to conduct real world testing on those\nitems identified as major changes.\n\n*Response.* As with the plan due date, the practical implication of this proposal is that each\ndeveloper will need to submit their results reports to their ONC-ACB sufficiently in advance of\nthe due date for publication for the ONC-ACB to be able to complete its pre-publication\nresponsibilities for all of the results reports and still publish no later than that due date. In theory,\nthis means that in some cases developers could complete their real world testing relatively early\n\n\n\n\nin a given testing year and submit their results report for that year before the CMS submission\nwindow for that year’s measurement data even opens for the developer’s customers. However,\nconsidering the comments received, we do recognize it is possible developers may for various\nreasons not be able to complete their annual real world testing activities until fairly late in any\ngiven testing (calendar) year. We also recognize that the data submission window for CMS\nprograms can be a busy time for developers, and would not wish to disadvantage newer or\nsmaller developers who may not have separate resources available to finalize a report of real\nworld testing not concluded until late in the testing year while simultaneously supporting\ncustomers’ data submissions. In light of these comments, we have decided to finalize a deadline\nfor publication on the CHPL of the publicly accessible hyperlink to developers’ report of real\nworld testing conducted in the prior year at March 15 of each year (see § 170.405(b)(2)(ii)). This\nfinalized date gives an additional six weeks for finalization and submission by developers\ncompared to the date originally proposed. It also implements a single deadline, to which the\ndevelopers and ONC-ACBs are mutually accountable, in parallel to the annual real world testing\nplan submission requirement in § 170.405(b)(1). We believe this strikes an appropriate balance\nbetween timely availability of annual real world testing results and recognition that some\ndevelopers may need to devote a substantial amount of focus to the CMS quality measures data\nsubmission windows at the beginning of each year. Although we have opted not to mandate\ndevelopers submit their results reports to their ONC-ACBs by a date providing a minimum required\nlead time for ONC-ACBs’ required review of the report, we would suggest that ONC-ACBs and\ndevelopers consider the potential merits of allowing at least one calendar month between the\ndeveloper’s initial submission of their real world testing results report to the ONC-ACB and the\nMarch 15 publication deadline.\ne. Real World Testing Pilot Year\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledged in the Proposed Rule that a subsequent final rule for that may not\nprovide sufficient time for health IT developers to develop and submit plans for a full year of\nreal world testing in 2020 (84 FR 7497). Therefore, we indicated in the Proposed Rule that we\nexpected to provide an appropriate period of time for developers to submit their plans, and\npotentially treat 2020 as a “pilot” year for real world testing. We expected that the pilot testing of\nreal world testing would match up to the fullest extent practicable with our proposed real world\ntesting requirements (e.g., same criteria but for a shorter duration and without the same\nconsequences for noncompliance). We welcomed comments on this potential approach.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of comments specifically addressing this point were in support\nof 2020 being treated as a pilot year. One commenter agreed that deferring the implementation or\nconstructing a pilot year for the Program would be appropriate and stated their belief that 2020\nmay be too early even to conduct a pilot.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their thoughts on potential piloting of real world\ntesting and the timing of initiating real world testing requirements. In consideration of the timing\nof the final rule, we have decided not to finalize 2020 as a pilot year since developers will now\nhave the majority of calendar year 2020 to develop a prospective plan for real world testing that\nwould begin in 2021. However, we recognize that this first “performance” year of real world\ntesting in 2021 presents unique challenges with respect to the development of initial plans, and\nwe fully intend to approach both the submission of initial plans and submission of retrospective\ntesting results for those plans (i.e., 2021 real world testing results) as learning experiences for\ndevelopers that can be used to inform future iterations of real world test plans. As noted in the\nproposed rule (84 FR 7497), the due date for the first annual real world testing plan would be\nfinalized based in part on the timing of the final rule. Because this final rule is publishing well in\nadvance of the December 15 annual due date for publication of developers’ plans of real world\n\n\n\n\ntesting activities to be conducted in the following year, we have concluded it is reasonable to\nrequire the first annual real world testing plan be published via a publicly accessible hyperlink on\nthe CHPL no later than December 15, 2020. This initial real world testing plan must address any\nand all of the developer’s Health IT Modules that hold a current, valid certificate under the\nProgram as of August 31, 2020. The real world testing plan due to be published in December\n2020, will need to address the real world testing activities that will occur during calendar year\n2021. The report of results for this initial (2021) annual real world test cycle will be due to be\npublished on the CHPL no later than March 15, 2022.\nf. Health IT Modules Certified but not yet Deployed\nWe proposed (84 FR 7497) that even if a health IT developer does not have customers or\nhas not deployed their certified Health IT Module(s) at the time the real world testing plan is due,\nthe health IT developer would still need to submit a plan that prospectively addresses its plans\nfor real world testing that would occur in the coming year for those Health IT Modules that had\nbeen certified on or before August 31 of the calendar year in which the plan is due (the calendar\nyear immediately preceding the calendar year during which testing addressed by any given\nannual real world testing plan will take place). If a health IT developer has not yet deployed their\ncertified Health IT Module to any real world users when the annual real world testing results are\ndue for that module, we proposed that the developer would need to report as such to meet the\nproposed Maintenance of Certification requirement.\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments on this proposal.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized this proposal. Any Health IT Module certified to at least one\ncriterion within the scope of real world testing as of August 31 of a given year must be addressed\nby its developer’s real world testing plan for the subsequent year that must be published via\npublicly accessible hyperlink on the CHPL by the December 15 due date (see § 170.405(a)). This\n\n\n\n\nrequirement applies regardless of whether that Health IT Module is in actual real world use prior\nto December 15 (or the earlier date by which the developer and ONC-ACB agree the developer\nwill submit its annual real world testing plan to the ONC-ACB to ensure the developer and\nONC-ACB meet single, December 15, deadline for the plan to have been reviewed for\ncompleteness and published on CHPL). To ensure precise clarity about the effect of the August\n31 reference date for purposes of real world testing requirements, we reiterate that if a developer\nhas at least one Health IT Module certified to at least any one criterion within the real world\ntesting scope of applicability as of August 31 of a given year, the real world testing Condition\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements apply to that developer and the developer must\nsubmit an annual real world testing plan for that year, addressing each of their Health IT\nModule(s) certified to any (one or more) criteria listed in § 170.405(a) and that plan must meet\nthe requirements in § 170.405(b)(1)(iii) for each module and criterion. Only developers who\nhave no Health IT Module(s) certified to any criterion within the real world testing scope of\napplicability as of August 31 of a given year need not submit a real world testing plan that year\nand would not be required to perform real world testing in the subsequent year.\ng. Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP)\nAs discussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7497), as newer versions111\nbecome available\nfor adopted standards and implementation specifications included in the certification criteria\nsubject to the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we\nbelieve that a health IT developer’s ability to conduct ongoing maintenance on its certified\nHealth IT Module(s) to incorporate these newer versions of Secretary-adopted standards and\nimplementation specifications (“standards”) is essential to support interoperability in the real\n111\nWe note that standards developing organizations and consensus standards bodies use various nomenclature, such\nas “versions” or “releases,” to identify updates to standards and implementation specifications.\n\n\n\n\nworld. Updated versions of standards reflect insights gained from real-world implementation and\nuse. They also reflect industry stakeholders’ interests to improve the capacity, capability, and\nclarity of such standards to meet new, innovative business needs, which earlier standards\nversions cannot support. Therefore, as part of the real world testing Condition of Certification,\nwe proposed a Maintenance of Certification flexibility that we refer to as the Standards Version\nAdvancement Process (SVAP).112\nThis flexibility would permit health IT developers to\nvoluntarily use in their certified Health IT Modules newer versions of adopted standards so long\nas certain conditions are met. As we stated in the Proposed Rule, these conditions are not limited\nto but notably include successful real world testing of the Health IT Module using the new\nversion(s) subsequent to the inclusion of these newer standards and implementation specification\nversions in the Health IT Module’s certification. We proposed to establish the SVAP not only to\nmeet the Cures Act’s goals for interoperability, but also in response to the continuous\nstakeholder feedback that ONC has received through prior rulemakings and engagements, which\nrequested that ONC establish a predictable and timely approach within the Program to keep pace\nwith the industry’s standards development efforts.\n\nThe SVAP we proposed, with corresponding proposed revisions for §§ 170.500 and\n170.555, introduces two types of administrative flexibility for health IT developers participating\nin the Program (84 FR 7498). First, for those health IT developers with existing certified Health\nIT Module(s), such Health IT Modules could be upgraded to a new version of an adopted\nstandard within the scope of the certification and have support for that updated version of the\nstandard reflected on the Health IT Module’s certificate so long as: such version was approved\n112\nRegulation text implementing the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement was\nproposed in § 170.405, including but not limited to SVAP-specific provisions proposed in § 170.405(b)(5). The\nSVAP-specific provisions have now been finalized in § 170.405(b)(8) and (9) (see section VII.B.5.g of this final\nrule).\n\n\n\n\nby the National Coordinator for use in the Program; and the developer satisfied all requirements\nof the SVAP including demonstration of conformance through an acceptable means (84 FR 7498\nthrough 7500). For purposes of the SVAP as applied to updates to Health IT Modules with\ncertificates to criteria listed in § 170.405(a) that include prior version(s)113\nof the standards,\nacceptable means of demonstrating conformance include but are not necessarily limited to self-\ndeclaration of conformance, as proposed in 84 FR 7499 and finalized in this final rule. Second,\nfor those health IT developers presenting health IT for certification to a criterion listed in §\n170.405(a), a National Coordinator-approved newer version of a standard included in one of\nthese criteria could be used in lieu of or in addition to the version of that standard incorporated\nby reference in § 170.299 (84 FR 7498). However, for purposes of the SVAP as applied to health\nIT that is presented for certification to any criterion listed in § 170.405(a), developer self-\ndeclaration is an acceptable means of demonstrating conformance only where there is not yet\nanother conformance method available that can be validly used for that version of that standard\n(84 FR 7499 through 7500). The regulation text codifying requirements for health IT developers\nto avail themselves of each of the proposed types of administrative flexibility was proposed (84\nFR 7595 through 7596) in § 170.405(b)(5). Corresponding revisions to § 170.550 and § 170.555\nwere proposed in84 FR 7598.\n\nWe proposed that the SVAP would be available only for National Coordinator-approved\nnewer versions of standards and implementation specifications (“standards”) that have already\nbeen adopted into the Program by the Secretary through rulemaking in accordance with\napplicable law including the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and sections 3001\n113\nPrior versions for this purpose could include those incorporated by reference in § 170.299, National Coordinator\napproved newer versions, or a mix of such versions for any or all of the standards adopted by the Secretary in\nsubpart B of part 170 that are included in a given criterion.\n\n\n\n\nand 3004 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 300jj-1 and 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11)\n(84 FR 7498). We have finalized this aspect of the standards version advancement flexibility as\nproposed. Under current law and the finalized SVAP flexibility, a standard must be initially\nadopted by the Secretary through rulemaking before the National Coordinator can approve the\nuse of newer updated versions of that standard in the Program.\n\nWe also proposed that a health IT developer would be able to choose which of the\nupdated standards versions approved by the National Coordinator for use in certification to\ninclude in its updated certified Health IT Module and would be able to do so on an itemized basis\n(84 FR 7499).\n\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that we welcomed comments on any and all aspects of\nour proposed SVAP as an option available to developers through maintenance requirements as\npart of the real world testing Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (84 FR\n7500). We also invited comments on our proposal to allow in conjunction with this maintenance\nflexibility the opportunity for developers to elect to present health IT for initial testing and\ncertification either to more advanced versions or to the prior adopted versions of the standards\nincluded in regulatory text as of the date the Health IT Modules are presented for certification.\n\n*Comments.* Comments were strongly supportive of the SVAP. Several commenters\nrecommended the description of this process include recognition of the fact that developers and\nsystems might need to maintain operational support for previously adopted versions of standards\nto avoid potential adverse effects on data access, exchange, and use.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the SVAP in § 170.405(b)(8) and (9) to provide the\nflexibility for which stakeholders’ comments expressed support. This flexibility includes the\noption for a Health IT Module to be certified to the standards versions incorporated by reference\nin § 170.299 and/or one or more National Coordinator-approved updated versions of standards\n\n\n\n\nincluded in the criteria listed in § 170.405(a). Thus, once the National Coordinator has approved\nfor use in the Program more advanced version(s) of any standard(s) applicable to any of the\ncriteria listed in § 170.405(a), a health IT developer will have flexibility to choose on an itemized\nbasis which of the National Coordinator-approved updated standards versions they wish to have\nincluded in their Health IT Module certification(s). Using the SVAP flexibility does not require a\ndeveloper cease supporting prior version releases of standards referenced by applicable\ncertification criteria.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed concerns about the effect of an uneven pace of\nadvanced version implementation across health IT developers and products within and outside\nthe Program. Several of these commenters recommended that, as developers voluntarily seek to\nsupport newer versions of standards and specifications through the SVAP, they also be required\nto maintain support for the adopted version of the standard listed in the Code of Federal\nRegulations (45 CFR part 170, subpart B) for the applicable criteria until HHS conducts\nrulemaking that would require all certified health IT upgrade to the newer version of the standard\nand sunset older versions of the standard from the Program on a mandatory, coordinated\ntimeline.\n\n*Response.* We do recognize the importance of ensuring that updated versions of standards\nare approved and available for use in the Program only when such use is consistent with the\nProgram’s purposes. We do not anticipate that the National Coordinator would approve a newer\nversion of a standard for use in the Program where that is inconsistent with the Program’s\npurposes, notably including the maintenance and advancement of interoperability. Moreover, we\nbelieve there is substantial value in allowing for the market to, in effect, sunset obsolete\nstandards versions at its own pace unless a hard cutover (or other highly coordinated nationwide\ntimeline for abandoning older versions) would be necessary to sustain functional interoperability.\n\n\n\n\nThe SVAP flexibility simply allows for a developer to choose to work with their ONC-ACB to\nobtain certification, or to modify the scope of the of Health IT Module’s certification, to reflect\nthat the Health IT Module as certified includes: the version of each adopted standard that is\nincorporated by reference in § 170.299; or a specific National Coordinator-approved updated\nversion of each applicable standard; or a National Coordinator-approved updated version for\neach of one or more applicable standard(s); or multiple version(s) of any one or more adopted\nstandard(s). Previously, developers were free to upgrade certified Health IT Modules to support\nnewer versions of adopted standards, but only in addition to the version(s) of those standards\nincorporated by reference in § 170.299. In our experience, newer versions render prior versions\nobsolete on a more rapid pace for some standards than for others and more rapidly than the\nversions incorporated by reference in regulations could be updated. Prior feedback had indicated\nthat being required to maintain support for the version of a standard that is incorporated by\nreference in § 170.299 solely for the purpose of maintaining regulatory compliance under the\nProgram represented a burden without commensurate value in cases where customers’\noperational interoperability needs could be met only by use of newer version(s) of particular\nadopted standards than the versions listed in the regulations. The SVAP is designed to eliminate\nthat burden and simultaneously provide, through inclusion of support for advanced standards\nversions within a Health IT Module’s certification, enhanced assurance to users that Health IT\nModules supporting National Coordinator-approved newer versions of standards under the\nSVAP flexibility continue to meet all of the requirements of the criteria to which the Health IT\nModule is certified.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters requested clarification on how the proposed\nStandards Version Advancement Process would align with expansion of the USCDI, or whether\nthe USCDI will be versioned through the SVAP. Some commenters expressed an opinion that\n\n\n\n\nthe USCDI expansion process should not be executed or allowed via the SVAP and instead\nrequire rulemaking.\n\n*Response.* As discussed in section IV.B.1, we have adopted the USCDI as a standard in §\n170.213 and incorporated USCDI v1 by reference in § 170.299(n)(5). For purposes of the SVAP,\nthe USCDI will be treated like any other standard. This means that health IT when presented for\ncertification to any one or more criteria referencing § 170.213 will be required to support USCDI\nv1 or a later version, with SVAP providing flexibility for developers to choose whether to\nsupport later versions of USCDI that the National Coordinator may approve for use in the\nProgram in lieu of or in complement to USCDI v1. Developers and will not be required to\nsupport newer versions of the USCDI standard instead of USCDI v1 until such time as § 170.213\nand § 170.299 are updated. However, developers may voluntary choose to use the SVAP\nflexibility to voluntarily upgrade certified Health IT Modules, or to seek certification of their\nhealth IT, to newer version release(s) of the USCDI if such release(s) have been approved by the\nNational Coordinator for use under the Program. As with any other standard relevant to the\nSVAP flexibility, we would anticipate that the National Coordinator would not approve for\nvoluntary use under the Program an updated version of any standard that would render Health IT\nModule(s) using it incapable of exchanging EHI with other technology certified under the\nProgram to other version(s) of the standard. We also note that, although HHS is the steward of\nthe USCDI standard, we have not at this time foreclosed the possibility that we could publish a\nnewer update of the USCDI that the National Coordinator would not immediately approve for\ndevelopers’ voluntary use under the Program via the SVAP flexibility. We recognize a potential\nthat expanding the USCDI to include additional data classes in future versions could lead to\nHealth IT Modules certified to these more advanced versions of USCDI being able to access,\nuse, and exchange more data classes than Health IT Modules certified only to earlier versions of\n\n\n\n\nthe USCDI. However, the technology certified to National Coordinator-approved newer versions\nof the USCDI would be capable of exchanging the data classes included in prior version(s) of the\nstandard. Thus, the flexibility maintains interoperability while allowing those who need\nadditional data classes to be fully supported by certified health IT in their access, exchange, and\nuse of these additional data classes and not forcing other users of certified health IT (who do not\nyet need to access, exchange, or use such additional data classes) to update their health IT. We\ntherefore believe that allowing for expansion of data for which certified Health IT Modules can\nsupport interoperability at a pace driven by the market’s progress in standards development and\ndemand for interoperability is an important benefit of the SVAP flexibility.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated the SVAP would be more effective for electronic\nprescribing if it could be used to allow voluntary adoption of a new version of the NCPDP\nSCRIPT standard by prescribers, pharmacies, and Part D prescription drug plans without CMS\nrulemaking.\n\n*Response.* CMS is solely responsible for Medicare Part D program regulations and other\npolicies, including its required e-prescribing standards and standards versions. In the future, the\nSVAP flexibility could enable developers to have the certifications of their Health IT Modules to\ne-prescribing criteria updated to reflect conformance of the Health IT Modules to newer versions\nof adopted standards that might be required by CMS Part D program or other HHS regulatory\nrequirements before we could update the version(s) of e-prescribing standards incorporated by\nreference in § 170.299. This approach would avoid the need for CMS or ONC to go through joint\nrulemaking in order maintain programmatic alignment.\nh. Updating Already Certified Health IT Leveraging SVAP Flexibility\nWe proposed that in instances where a health IT developer has certified a Health IT\nModule, including but not limited to instances where its customers are already using the certified\n\n\n\n\nHealth IT Module, if the developer intends to update pursuant to the SVAP election, the\ndeveloper will be required to provide advance notice to all affected customers and its ONC-\nACB: (a) expressing its intent to update the software to newer versions of the standard approved\nby the National Coordinator through the SVAP; (b) the developer’s expectations for how the\nupdate will affect interoperability of the affected Health IT Module as it is used in the real world;\nand (c) whether the developer intends to continue to support the certificate for the existing\nHealth IT Module version for some period of time and how long, or if the existing version of the\nHealth IT Module certified to prior version(s) of applicable standards will be deprecated (e.g.,\nthat the developer will stop supporting the earlier version of the module and request to have the\ncertificate withdrawn) (84 FR 7498). The notice would be required to be provided sufficiently in\nadvance of the developer establishing its planned timeframe for implementation of the upgrade\nto the more advanced standard(s) version(s) in order to offer customers reasonable opportunity to\nask questions and plan for the update. We requested public comment on the minimum time prior\nto an anticipated implementation of an updated standard or implementation specification version\nupdate that should be considered reasonable for purposes of allowing customers, especially\nhealth care providers using the Health IT Module in their health care delivery operations, to\nadequately plan for potential implications of the update for their operations and their exchange\nrelationships. We also requested comments on specific certification criteria, standards,\ncharacteristics of the certified Health IT Module or its implementation (such as locally hosted by\nthe customer using it versus software-as-a-service type of implementation), or specific types or\ncharacteristics of customers that could affect the minimum advance notice that should be\nconsidered reasonable across variations in these factors (84 FR 7499).\n\n*Comments.* Only a few commenters offered thoughts specifically on the minimum time\nprior to an anticipated implementation of an updated standard or implementation specification\n\n\n\n\nversion update that should be considered reasonable. Several of these commenters noted that\ndifferent market segments and provider types vary in their willingness or ability to upgrade to\nnew software versions. One comment submission indicated two months would be a reasonable\nminimum time prior to implementation of an updated standard for their customers to be notified.\n\nAnother commenter observed that the minimum timeframe prior to an anticipated\nimplementation of an updated standard is two to four years.\n\n*Response.* The comments received comport with our prior understanding that the\nminimum advance notice needed to offer customers reasonable opportunity to ask questions and\nplan for the update or modification of Health IT Modules the customers are using or have\npurchased and scheduled for deployment varies across different circumstances. We have,\ntherefore, decided to finalize the advance notice requirement as proposed. The regulation text for\nthis requirement is finalized in § 170.405(b)(8)(i). Thus, a developer choosing to take advantage\nof the SVAP flexibility must provide notice to its customers sufficiently in advance of the\ndeveloper’s anticipated timeframe for implementation of the update to the newer version(s) of\napplicable standard(s) to offer customers reasonable opportunity to ask questions and plan for the\nupdate. We note for clarity that we intend to apply a reasonableness standard to evaluating\nadequacy of advance notice timeframes for particular version updates in their specific factual\ncontexts, prioritizing the perspective of a reasonable person in the situation of the developer’s\ncustomers because this requirement is intended to protect the interests of those customers. We\nwould anticipate that proactive engagement between the developers and their customers would\nresult in mutually agreeable timeframes and obviate the need for us to assess reasonableness in at\nleast the vast majority, and ideally the totality, of instances where developers choose to use the\nSVAP flexibility.\ni. Health IT Modules Presented for Certification Leveraging SVAP Flexibility\n\n\n\n\nIn instances where a health IT developer presents health IT for certification to a criterion\nlisted in § 170.405(a) to which the health IT is not already certified, we proposed that the health\nIT developer would be permitted to use National Coordinator-approved newer versions of any or\nall of the standards included in the criterion, instead of or in combination with the versions of\nthese standards incorporated by reference in § 170.299. In such circumstances, a health IT\ndeveloper would be able to choose which National Coordinator-approved standard version(s) it\nseeks to include in a new or updated certified Health IT Module and would be able to do so on an\nitemized basis. To enable this flexibility for developers seeking certification, we proposed to\namend ONC-ACB Principles of Proper Conduct (PoPC) to require ONC-ACBs offer\ncertification to National Coordinator-approved newer versions of standards and provide the\nability for ONC-ACBs to accept a developer self-declaration of conformity as to the use,\nimplementation, and conformance to a newer version of a standard (including but not limited to\nimplementation specifications) as sufficient demonstration of conformance in circumstances\nwhere the National Coordinator has approved a version update of a standard for use in\ncertification but no testing tool is yet available to test to the newer version (84 FR 7501).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters supported the proposal to allow for both updates to existing\ncertifications of Health IT Modules and newly sought certifications to applicable criteria to\nfollow a process of self-declaration where approved test tools are not yet available to support\nconformance validation of the pertinent National Coordinator-approved newer version of a\nstandard. A few commenters requested we clarify how developers can demonstrate conformance\nwhen a newer version of a standard is available for use under this process but does not yet have\ntesting tools available under the Program.\n\n*Response.* We proposed (84 FR 7456) and have finalized modifications in § 170.523(h) to\npermit ONC-ACBs to certify Health IT Modules that the ONC-ACB has evaluated for\n\n\n\n\nconformance with certification criteria without first passing through an ONC-ATL. As finalized,\n§ 170.523(h)(2) provides that an ONC-ACB may certify a Health IT Module that has been\nevaluated by it for compliance with a conformance method approved by the National\nCoordinator. This provides flexibility for the National Coordinator to approve a conformance\nmethod other than ONC-ATL testing, for evaluating conformance where the National\nCoordinator has approved a version update of a standard for use in certification but an associated\ntesting tool is not yet updated to test to the newer version. We have also made edits to the text in\n§ 170.405(b) as finalized in comparison to the text included in the Proposed Rule to make more\nimmediately clear which specific requirements apply when developers choose to take advantage\nof the SVAP flexibility for updating Health IT Modules already certified to a criterion listed in §\n170.405(a) and which specific requirements apply when developers choose to leverage the\nflexibility when presenting Health IT Modules for certification to a criterion listed in §\n170.405(a).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended HHS give health IT developers’ flexibility to\nchoose which standards to advance through this process and not obligate them to update to all\npossible standards at once.\n\n*Response.* In the Proposed Rule, we noted (84 FR 7497) that a health IT developer would\nbe able to choose which National Coordinator-approved standard version(s) it seeks to include in\na new or updated certified Health IT Module and would be able to do so on an itemized basis.\n\nUnder the finalized SVAP flexibility in § 170.405(b)(9), health IT developers are permitted to\nchoose to use National Coordinator-approved version(s) or the version incorporated by reference\nin § 170.299 or both for any standard(s) included in applicable criteria it seeks to use in its\ncertified Health IT Module(s) on an itemized, standard-by-standard basis at the developer’s\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, the regulation text for all SVAP requirements was proposed to be\ncodified in § 170.405(b)(5). The SVAP requirements, as finalized, are codified in§ 170.405(b)(8)\nand (9). We decided to codify the finalized SVAP requirements in separate paragraphs because it\ncomplements other wording changes to the finalized regulation text that we made to make more\nimmediately clear on the face of the regulation which specific requirements (§ 170.405(b)(8))\napply when developers choose to take advantage of the SVAP flexibility for updating Health IT\nModules already certified to a criterion listed in § 170.405(a) and which specific requirements (§\n170.405(b)(9)) apply when developers choose to leverage the flexibility when presenting Health\nIT Modules for certification to a criterion listed in § 170.405(a).\nj. Requirements Associated with All Health IT Modules Certified Leveraging\nSVAP\nAs outlined in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7499), in all cases, regardless of whether a\nhealth IT developer is updating an existing certified Health IT Module or presenting a new\nHealth IT Module for certification to new versions of adopted standards approved by the\nNational Coordinator through the Standards Version Advancement Process, we proposed that\nany developer choosing to take advantage of the proposed flexibility would need to:\n Ensure its mandatory disclosures in § 170.523(k)(1) appropriately reflect its use of any\nNational Coordinator-approved newer versions of adopted standards; and\n Address and adhere to all Program requirements—including but not limited to\nConditions of Certification and Maintenance of Certification requirements—that are\napplicable to its certified Health IT Modules regardless of whether those Health IT\nModules were certified to the adopted standards found in 45 CFR part 170 or National\nCoordinator-approved newer version(s) of the adopted standard(s).\n\nFor example, as we proposed, a developer would need to ensure that its real world testing\n\n\n\n\nplan and actual real world testing include the National Coordinator-approved newer versions of\nstandards to which it is claiming conformance, beginning with the plan for and real world testing\nconducted in the year immediately following the first year the developer’s applicable Health IT\nModule(s) were, as of August 31, certified to the National Coordinator-approved newer versions\nof standards.\n\nUnder the policies outlined in the Proposed Rule, developers would be held accountable\nfor maintaining all applicable certified Health IT Modules in conformance with any National\nCoordinator-approved newer versions of standards and implementation specifications that they\nvoluntarily elect to use in their certified health IT under the real world testing Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements proposed in § 170.405, the attestations Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements proposed in § 170.406, and through ONC-ACB\nsurveillance applying to certificates that include National Coordinator-approved updated\nversions as it does to those that do not. We also included discussion indicating our intent that\ndevelopers would be accountable for correcting non-conformities with certification criteria that\nwere discovered in real world testing of a Health IT Module certified using National\nCoordinator-approved newer versions. Under the proposed policies, prompt corrective action\nwould be required by a developer discovering such non-conformity through real world testing, in\nsimilar manner as a developer would be accountable for correcting non-conformities discovered\nthrough real world testing of Health IT Modules certified using only the versions of Secretary-\nadopted standards that are incorporated by reference in § 170.299, or through other Program\nmeans.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive specific comments on these general requirements and\ndetails of the relationship between the proposed SVAP and other proposed Program\nenhancements or existing accountability mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We have finalized these details of our SVAP policies as proposed.\n\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that we anticipate providing ONC-ACBs (and/or health\nIT developers) with a means to attribute information on Health IT Modules’ support for National\nCoordinator-approved updated versions of standards to the listings on the CHPL for the Health\nIT Modules the ONC-ACB has certified, and proposed to require in the PoPC for ONC-ACBs\nthat they are ultimately responsible for this information being made publicly available on the\nCHPL (84 FR 7501). We requested public comment on any additional information about updated\nstandards versions that may be beneficial to have listed with certified Health IT Modules on the\nCHPL.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended ONC provide a method on the ONC CHPL for\ndocumenting the dot version/release associated with the new standard version implementation\nand clarify the ONC-ACBs reporting timeline for these types of standard version updates.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for the feedback, which will help to inform our\ninternal deliberations about future operational planning.\nk. Advanced Version Approval for SVAP\nThe Proposed Rule (84 FR 7500) included discussion of how, after a standard has been\nadopted through notice and comment rulemaking, ONC anticipated undertaking an open and\ntransparent process to timely ascertain whether a more recent version of any standard or\nimplementation specification that the Secretary as adopted in part 170 should be approved for\ndevelopers’ voluntary use under the Program. We requested commenters’ input on our\nanticipated approach to standards and implementation specification advanced version approval as\noutlined in the Proposed Rule.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concerns that appeared to suggest an\nunderstanding that the SVAP would be used to adopt new standards into the Program.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* As stated in the Proposed Rule, the SVAP flexibility can only be used for\nnewer (sometimes known as “updated”) versions of standards and implementation specifications\nthat the Secretary has already adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking.114\nComments. One commenter urged that in order to be considered for approval for\nvoluntary use under the Program the full details of a version of a standard should be required to\nbe publicly available online by the start of opportunity for public review and discussion of the\nlist of versions under consideration.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. Although specifics of operational processes are\noutside the scope of this rule, we wish to reassure all stakeholders that we do appreciate the value\nof ensuring public dialogue around such matters as consideration of standards versions for\npotential voluntary use in the program is appropriately supported by availability of relevant\ninformation. As we operationalize support for finalized policies including the SVAP, we plan to\nprovide ample public outreach and communications through channels familiar to affected\nstakeholders – including but not limited to ONC’s HealthIT.gov website.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested various potential features or processes that\ncould be used in ascertaining whether a more recent version of any standard or implementation\nspecification that the Secretary as adopted in part 170 should be approved by the National\nCoordinator for developers’ voluntary use under the Program. We also received several\ncomments regarding potential uses of information from the standards review and approval\nprocesses or the SVAP flexibility itself to inform assessments of various aspects of the health IT\necosystem such as the maturity and uptake of specific standards versions.\n\n114\nAs also noted in the Proposed Rule, this policy considers the substance of a standard and not whether its name or\nversion naming and identification track remains unchanged over time, as standards developing organizations and\nprocesses may apply different naming or identification methods from one version to another of the same standards\nor implementation specifications. For more information on version naming and identification tracks for standards\nand implementation specifications, please see the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7500).\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* Although addressing their substance is outside the scope of this final rule, we\nappreciate these responses to our call for comments. This information will help to inform our\ndeliberations about future program policies and operations.\nl. Real World Testing Principles of Proper Conduct for ONC-ACBs\nWe proposed to include a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs in § 170.523(p) that would require\nONC-ACBs to review and confirm that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing\nplans and results in accordance with our proposals (84 FR 7501). The proposed requirement was\nthat the ONC-ACBs review the plans for completeness. Once completeness is confirmed, we\nproposed that ONC-ACBs would provide the plans to ONC and make them publicly available by\nDecember 15 of each year (see § 170.523(p)(1) and (3) in 84 FR 7598). We proposed that for the\nreasons discussed above in context of developer requirements, we have finalized (in §\n170.405(b)(1)) December 15 of each year as the due date for the annual real world testing plans.\n\nWe proposed in § 170.523(p)(2) that the ONC-ACB would “review and confirm that applicable\nhealth IT developers submit real world testing results in accordance with § 70.405(b)(2).” And in\n§ 170.523(p)(3) we proposed that the ONC-ACBs would be required to submit real world testing\nresults by April 1 of each year to ONC for public availability (84 FR 7598).\n\n*Comments.* The only comments received relevant to these PoPC proposals were about\ndue dates, and were summarized above in context of the § 170.405 requirements applicable to\ndevelopers (see section VII.B.5.d Submission Dates, in this final rule).\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters again for their feedback on this proposal and have\nfinalized the PoPC (170.523(p)(1)-(3)) as proposed, with the exception of having adjusted in §\n170.523(p)(3) the annual due date for publication of developers’ real world testing results reports\non CHPL from the proposed April 1 to the finalized March 15 date.\n\nBecause we proposed to allow health IT developers to implement National Coordinator-\n\n\n\n\napproved newer versions of adopted standards and implementation specifications in certified\nHealth IT Modules, we proposed two requirements to ensure the public has knowledge and\nONC-ACBs can maintain appropriate oversight and surveillance of the version of a standard that\ncertified health IT meets. First, we proposed to revise the PoPCs in § 170.523(m) to add\nsubparagraph (4) requiring ONC-ACBs to aggregate, no less than quarterly, all updates\nsuccessfully made to use newer versions of adopted standards in certified health IT per the\nrequirements for developers choosing to take advantage of the SVAP flexibility. This would\nensure that ONC is aware of the version of a standard that certified health IT meets for the\npurposes of Program administration. Second, we proposed, that a developer that chooses to avail\nitself of the SVAP flexibility must address its use of newer versions of adopted standards in its\nreal world testing plans and results.\n\nWe sought comment on the proposed additions to the PoPC for ONC-ACBs. More\nspecifically, we sought comment on whether ONC-ACBs should be required to perform an\nevaluation beyond a completeness check for the real world testing plans and results and the value\nversus the burden of such an endeavor.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on this proposal.\n\n*Response.* The substance of the requirement is finalized as proposed, though, we have\nmade clarifying edits to the way in which the PoPC amendments are organized and phrased. The\nrequirement proposed in § 170.523(m)(4) (84 FR 7599) has been re-designated in §\n170.523(m)(5). In the finalized § 170.523(m)(5), we have revised the citation to the SVAP\nrequirements because they were proposed in § 170.405(b)(5) but are finalized in § 170.405(b)(8)\nand (9). The wording of requirement finalized in § 170.523(m)(5) was modified in comparison to\nthat proposed in 84 FR 7599 to make clear that ONC-ACBs are required to report on all\ncertifications of Health IT Modules to National Coordinator-approved newer versions of\n\n\n\n\nSecretary-adopted standards, both those updated to include newer versions of adopted standards\nand those of Health IT Modules first presented for certification using newer versions of adopted\nstandards. Another modification to the finalized regulation text in § 170.523(m)(5) in\ncomparison with that proposed clarifies that ONC-ACBs are permitted to obtain the quarterly\nrecord of successful use in certified Health IT Modules of newer versions of adopted standards\nfrom the ONC-ACB’s records of certification activity. We believe this clarification is important\nto ensure the regulation text finalized in § 170.523(m)(5) cannot be misconstrued as precluding\nuse of such records as the data source for this requirement.\n\nIn complement to the above requirements to ensure transparency for the public and end\nusers, we proposed in § 170.523(t) a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs requiring them to ensure that\ndevelopers seeking to take advantage of the SVAP flexibility in § 170.405(b) comply with the\napplicable requirements, and that the ONC-ACB both retain records of the timing and content of\ndevelopers’ required115\nnotices and ensure each notice is timely and publicly accessible, and\neasily located via the CHPL through attribution of the notice to the certified Health IT Modules\nto which it applies.116\nWe note that in the proposed regulation text in § 170.523(t) as published in 84 FR 7598,\nthere was an editorial error. The editorial error was in title in § 170.523(t) as published in 84 FR\n7598, which read “Standards Voluntary Advancement Process” instead of “Standards Version\nAdvancement Process,” although the proposed introductory text correctly referenced “Standards\nVersion Advancement Process.”\n\n115\nThe advance notice requirement that was proposed in § 170.405(b)(5)(i) and that is now finalized in §\n170.405(b)(8)(i) remains specific to developers leveraging SVAP flexibility to update Health IT Modules with\nexisting certifications.\n\n116\nWe note for clarity that whether a copy of the content is hosted on CHPL, made available via a publicly accessible\nhyperlink provided by the developer, or another mechanism or method that may emerge as a more advanced and\nefficient technical approach to achieving this same goal is an operational detail and does not need to be defined in\nrulemaking.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive public comment on the proposed paragraph (t) or its\naddition to § 170.523.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized § 170.523(t) with a revised title more consistent with the\nfinalized titles of paragraphs (8) and (9) in § 170.405(b), and a revised citation to § 170.405. The\ncitation to § 170.405 was revised because the SVAP requirements 170.523(t) references were\nproposed in § 170.405(b)(5) but have been finalized in § 170.405(b)(8) and (9). The substance of\nthe PoPC requirement in § 170.523(t) is finalized as proposed.\nm. Health IT Module Certification & Certification to Newer Versions of Certain\nStandards\nWe proposed to add in § 170.550, Health IT Module certification, a new paragraph\n(e), which would require that ONC-ACBs must provide an option for certification of Health\nIT Modules to any one or more of the criteria referenced in § 170.405(a) based on newer\nversions of standards included in the criteria which have been approved by the National\nCoordinator for use in certification through the Standards Version Advancement Process (84\nFR 7598).\n\n*Comments.* We received no public comments on this proposed addition to § 170.550 to\naccommodate the SVAP flexibility.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the substance of § 170.550(e) as proposed. We have\nmodified the regulatory text finalized in § 170.550(e) in comparison with that proposed in 84\nFR 7598 by adding a header. The finalized paragraph reads: “Standards Updates. ONC-ACBs\nmust provide an option for certification of Health IT Modules to any one or more of the\ncriteria referenced in § 170.405(a) based on newer versions of standards included in the\ncriteria which have been approved by the National Coordinator for use in certification.”\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed to revise § 170.555(b)(1) to accommodate the SVAP flexibility. The\nrevised text in § 170.555(b)(1) as proposed (84 FR 7598) read: ONC-ACBs are not required to\ncertify Complete EHRs and/or Health IT Module(s) according to newer versions of standards\nadopted and named in subpart B of this part, unless: (i) The National Coordinator identifies a\nnewer version through the Standards Version Advancement Process and a health IT developer\nvoluntarily elects to seek certification of its health IT in accordance with § 170.405(b)(5); or\n(ii) The new version is incorporated by reference in § 170.299.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive public comments on revising paragraph (b)(1) of §\n170.555 to accommodate the SVAP flexibility.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the substance of this revision as proposed. However, we\nhave struck “Complete EHRs and/or” from the text finalized in § 170.555(b)(1) consistent with\nour finalizing the removal from 45 CFR part 170 of references to “Complete EHRs” in\nconjunction with the removal of the 2014 Edition (as discussed in section III.B.2 of this final\nrule). We have clarified the text in § 170.555(b)(1) as finalized to use the word “approves” in\nplace of “identifies,” consistent with our phrasing and terminology throughout the preamble of\nthis final rule and finalized regulation text implementing the SVAP flexibility. We have replaced\n“under the Standards Version Advancement Process” with “for use in certification” because we\nbelieve this wording prevents potential confusion about whether the term “Standards Version\nAdvancement Process” refers to the administrative flexibility established in § 170.405(b)(8) and\n(9) or to the National Coordinator’s approach to approving versions for use in the Program. We\nhave also revised the citation to § 170.405(b) in the finalized text in § 170.555 because the\nSVAP provisions proposed in § 170.405(b)(5) have been finalized in § 170.405(b)(8) and (9).\n\n6. Attestations\nThe Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of\n\n\n\n\nCertification requirement under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation to all of the\nConditions of Certification requirements specified in PHSA § 3001(c)(5)(D), except for the\n“EHR reporting criteria submission” Condition of Certification requirement in §\n3001(c)(5)(D)(vii). We proposed to implement the Cures Act by requiring health IT developers\nto attest, as applicable, to compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements proposed in §§ 170.401 through 170.405.\n\nWe proposed that, as a Maintenance of Certification requirement for the “attestations”\n\nCondition of Certification requirement under § 170.406(b), health IT developers would need to\nsubmit their attestations every 6 months (i.e., semiannually). We proposed to provide a 14-day\nattestation period twice a year. For health IT developers presenting Health IT Modules for\ncertification for the first time under the Program, we proposed that they would be required to\nsubmit an attestation at the time of certification and also comply with the semiannual attestation\nperiods. As stated in the Proposed Rule, we would publicize and prompt developers to complete\ntheir attestation during the required attestation periods. We also proposed to provide a method\nfor health IT developers to indicate their compliance, noncompliance with, or the inapplicability\nof each Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement as it applies to all of their health\nIT certified under the Program for each attestation period. Last, we proposed to provide health IT\ndevelopers the flexibility to specify noncompliance per certified Health IT Module, if necessary.\n\nWe noted, however, that any noncompliance with the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements, including the “attestations” Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements, would be subject to ONC direct review, corrective action, and\nenforcement procedures under the Program.\n\nWe welcomed comments on the proposed attestations Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements, including the appropriate frequency and timing of attestations. We\n\n\n\n\nalso welcomed comments on the proposed responsibilities for ONC-ACBs related to the\nattestations of Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments supporting the “attestations” Condition and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements. Commenters generally agreed that health IT\ndevelopers should attest that they are complying with all the required Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements. A few commenters were concerned that the\nCondition of Certification requirements set up unreasonable expectations that health IT\ndevelopers attest to statements that are subject to interpretation and are ambiguous, and that\ndevelopers should be able to articulate how their software and businesses meet the expectations.\n\nWe also received comments suggesting ways to reduce burden for health IT developers.\n\nSome commenters suggested less frequent attestation periods ranging from once a year to every\ntwo years as a means for reducing burden on health IT developers. Another commenter\nsuggested that we send reminders to health IT developers when an attestation(s) needs renewal.\n\nOne commenter recommended that we include a specific deadline at the middle and end of each\nyear for attestations in lieu of the proposed predefined 14-day attestation window. Another\ncommenter recommended that attestations should only be sent electronically as any other process\nof reporting (e.g., written letter) would be onerous on all parties.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support and have adopted in § 170.406 the\n“attestations” Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirement with revisions discussed\nbelow. These revisions should both provide clarity for compliance and reduce burden.\n\nHealth IT developers will be attesting to the Conditions of Certification that are statutory\nrequirements under section 4002 of the Cures Act. This final rule also addresses concerns of\nambiguity and interpretation by revising the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements and the information blocking provision, which is a Condition of Certification in §\n\n\n\n\n170.401. We have also revised § 170.406 to provide further clarity on the applicability of each of\nthe Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements to health IT developers for the\npurposes of attestation. For example, all health IT developers under the Program would attest to\nthe “information blocking” Condition of Certification requirement (§ 170.401), while only health\nIT developers that have health IT certified to the “API” certification criteria (§ 170.315(g)(7) –\n(10)) would be required to attest to the “API” Condition of Certification and Maintenance\nrequirements (§ 170.404). We have also revised the “attestations” Conditions and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements in § 170.406 to clearly reflect that all attestations must be approved\nand submitted by an officer, employee, or other representative the health IT developer has\nauthorized to make a binding attestation(s) on behalf of the health IT developer. This provides\nregulatory clarity for health IT developers as to their responsibility under the attestation\nprovisions (§ 170.406).\n\nA requirement of attestation every 6 months properly balances the need to support\nenforcement actions with the attestation burden placed on developers. In this regard, allegations\nof inappropriate actions and non-compliance by health IT developers with Program requirements\nand the information blocking provision can be more readily cross-referenced against their\nattestations for enforcement purposes comparative to a one-year or two-year attestation period.\n\nBased on the efficient methods we are establishing for attestation as described below, we believe\nthat we have implemented this statutory requirement for health IT developers in ways that will\nreduce the compliance burden for them. We also refer readers to section VII.D of this preamble\nfor discussion of ONC direct review, corrective action, and enforcement procedures for the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements under the Program.\n\nWe recognize comments expressing concerns on the potential burden placed on\nhealth IT developers to attest semiannually. The process we plan to implement for providing\n\n\n\n\nattestations should minimize burden on health IT developers. To further minimize potential\nburden on health IT developers, we have revised the proposed 14-day attestation window to\nextend the window to 30 days. In other words, health IT developers will be able to submit\ntheir attestations within a designated 30-day window twice a year for purposes of\ncompliance. To note, in accordance with § 170.406(b), the first attestation window will\nbegin April 1, 2021. This attestation period will cover the time period from the effective\ndate of the final rule through March 31, 2021. This irregular time period is due to the\npublication of the final rule. Subsequently, a regular 6-month period will commence with\nthe attestation window for the 6-month period opening on October 1, 2021 (attesting for the\nperiod of April 1 through September 30). We have also revised the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements to reflect that all health IT developers under the\nProgram would adhere to a similar semiannual attestation schedule, rather than new health\nIT developers also attesting at the time of certification. We believe this is more practical,\nless burdensome for health IT developers and ONC-ACBs, and creates less confusion as to\nwhat actions and statements a health IT developer is attesting to (i.e., for past actions under\nthe Program).\n\nAs stated in the Proposed Rule, we plan to implement several other means to\nminimize burden. First, we plan to publicize and prompt developers to complete their\nattestation during the required attestation periods. Second, as proposed in the Proposed\nRule, we will provide a method for health IT developers to indicate their compliance,\nnoncompliance, or the inapplicability of each Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirement as it applies to all or each of their Health IT Modules certified under the\nProgram for each attestation period. Third, to clarify our proposal and respond to the\ncomment recommending electronic submission, we note ONC-ACBs have discretion to\n\n\n\n\nspecify the format and may choose to require electronic submission. In addition, to support\nelectronic submission, we will provide a web-based form and method for health IT\ndevelopers to submit attestations in an efficient manner for ONC-ACBs’ review.\n\nONC-ACB Responsibilities\nWe proposed that attestations would be submitted to ONC-ACBs and reviewed in\naccordance with § 170.523(q) as a means for ONC-ACBs to monitor health IT developers for\ncompliance with Program requirements. ONC-ACBs would be required to share the attestations\nwith ONC. ONC would then make the attestations publicly available through the CHPL. The\nother responsibility we proposed in § 170.550(l) was that before issuing a certification, an ONC-\nACB would need to ensure that the health IT developer of the Health IT Module has met its\nresponsibilities related to the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements as solely\nevidenced by its attestation. For example, if a health IT developer with an active certification\nunder the Program provided noncompliant designations in their attestation but was already\nparticipating in a corrective action plan (CAP) under ONC direct review to resolve the\nnoncompliance, certification would be able to proceed while the issue is being resolved.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on the specific responsibilities of\nONC-ACBs when collecting and submitting attestations to ONC, including instances of an\nattestation indicating non-conformity and the lack of a submission of an attestation by a health IT\ndeveloper.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input and have finalized as proposed. We refer\nreaders to section VII.D for further discussion of ONC direct review, corrective action, and\nenforcement procedures for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements under\nthe Program, including the roles of ONC-ACBs in enforcement of the Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n\n\n\n7. EHR Reporting Criteria Submission\nAs stated in the Proposed Rule, the Cures Act specifies that health IT developers shall be\nrequired, as a Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement under the Program, to\nsubmit certain information to satisfy the reporting criteria on certified health IT in accordance\nwith the EHR Reporting Program requirements established under section 3009A of the PHSA, as\nadded by section 4002 of the Cures Act. We have not yet established an EHR Reporting\nProgram. Once ONC establishes such an EHR Reporting Program, we will undertake future\nrulemaking to propose and implement the associated Condition and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirement(s) for health IT developers.\n\nC. Compliance\nThe Maintenance of Certification requirements discussed above do not necessarily define\nall the outcomes necessary to meet the Conditions of Certification. Rather, they provide\npreliminary or baseline evidence toward measuring whether a Condition of Certification\nrequirement is being met. Thus, ONC could determine that a Condition of Certification\nrequirement is not being met through reasons other than the Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. For example, meeting the Maintenance of Certification requirement that requires a\nhealth IT developer to not establish or enforce any contract or agreement that contravenes the\nCommunications Condition of Certification requirement does not excuse a health IT developer\nfrom meeting all the requirements specified in the Communications Condition of Certification\nrequirement. This is analogous to clarifications ONC has previously provided about certification\ncriteria requirements whereby testing prior to certification sometimes only tests a subset of the\nfull criterion’s intended functions and scope. However, for compliance and surveillance\npurposes, we have stated that ONC and its ONC-ACBs will examine whether the certified health\nIT meets the full scope of the certification criterion rather than the subset of functions it was\n\n\n\n\ntested against (80 FR 62709 and 62710).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to compliance with Maintenance\nof Certification requirements as related to meeting Conditions of Certification requirements.\n\n*Response.* We continue to maintain our position that Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements do not define all of the outcomes necessary to meet the Conditions of Certification\nrequirements. Thus, while complying with Maintenance of Certification requirements will\nprovide evidence toward measuring whether a Condition of Certification requirement is being\nmet, reasons beyond the Maintenance of Certification requirements could result in ONC\ndetermining that a Condition of Certification requirement has not been met.\n\nD. Enforcement\nThe Cures Act affirms ONC’s role in using certification to improve health IT’s\ncapabilities for the access, use, and exchange of EHI. The Cures Act provides this affirmation\nthrough expanded certification authority for ONC to establish Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements for health IT developers that go beyond the certified health IT\nitself. The new Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in section 4002 of\nthe Cures Act focus on the actions and business practices of health IT developers (e.g.,\ninformation blocking and appropriate access, use, and exchange of electronic health\ninformation) as well as technical interoperability of health IT (e.g., APIs and real world\ntesting). Furthermore and equally important, section 4002 of the Cures Act provides that the\nSecretary of HHS may encourage compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements and take action to discourage noncompliance. Given these\nconsiderations, we proposed a general enforcement framework outlining a corrective action\nprocess for ONC to review potential or known instances where a Condition or Maintenance of\nCertification requirement has not been or is not being met by a health IT developer under the\n\n\n\n\nProgram, including the requirement for a health IT developer to attest to meeting the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n\n",

Third, §§ 170.580 and 170.581 have\nprovided thorough and transparent processes for working with health IT developers through\nnotice and corrective action to remedy Program non-conformities.

We\nnoted in the Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7503 that in the EOA final rule we signaled our intent to\nsend notices of potential non-conformity, non-conformity, suspension, proposed termination, and\ntermination via certified mail (81 FR 72429). However, we proposed to follow § 170.505 for\ncorrespondence regarding direct review of noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance\nof Certification requirements.\n\nAs discussed in the Proposed Rule, the type and extent of review by ONC could vary\nsignificantly based on the complexity and severity of each fact pattern. For instance, ONC may\nbe able to address certain noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements quickly and with minimal effort (e.g., failure to make public a documentation\nhyperlink), while other situations may be more complex and require additional time and effort\n(e.g., violation of API fee prohibitions). Considering this wide range of potential noncompliance\nwith the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we proposed that ONC\nretain discretion to decide, on a case-by-case basis, when to go beyond the provisions of §\n170.505 to use means other than email in providing notices and correspondence for\nnoncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\nWe solicited comment on the nature and types of noncompliance with the Conditions\nand Maintenance of Certification requirements that ONC should consider in determining the\nmethod of correspondence.

While we agree with commenters that there may be\nsituations when sending notice only via email would not be adequate, such situations would be\ncontingent on the circumstances as described in the Proposed Rule. Therefore, we have revised\nthe regulation text of § 170.505 to specify some of those considerations. These considerations\ninclude, but are not limited to, whether: the party requests use of correspondence beyond email;\nthe party has responded via email to our communications; we have sufficient information from\nthe party to ensure appropriate delivery of such notice; and, importantly, the alleged violation of\na Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement or other Program requirement within\nONC’s purview under § 170.580 indicates a serious violation of the Program with potential\nconsequences of suspension, certification termination, or a certification ban.\n\nWe did not propose any requirements regarding acknowledgment of receipt, and we have\nfinalized our proposed approach to utilize the processes previously established and codified in §§\n\n\n\n\n170.580 and 170.581 for ONC direct review of certified health IT for the enforcement of the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, which include response requirements\nalready codified in §§ 170.580 and 170.581.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter requested clarification on ONC’s timeframe for responding to\nhealth IT developers during direct review.

Additionally, we have finalized\nour recommendation, stated in 84 FR 7504 in the Proposed Rule and the EOA final rule, that\nhealth IT developers clearly mark, as described in HHS Freedom of Information Act regulations\nat 45 CFR 5.65(c), any information they regard as trade secret or confidential prior to disclosing\nthe information to ONC (81 FR 72431).\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed in 84 FR 7504 that if a health IT developer under ONC direct review for\nnoncompliance with a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement failed to work with\nONC or was otherwise noncompliant with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process,\nONC could issue a certification ban for the health IT developer (and its subsidiaries and\nsuccessors). A certification ban, as it currently does for other matters under § 170.581, would\nprohibit future health IT by the health IT developer from being certified.\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7504 that ONC would also consider termination of the\ncertificate(s) of the affected Health IT Module(s) should the health IT developer fail to work with\nONC or is otherwise noncompliant with the requirements of the CAP and/or CAP process. We\nproposed that ONC may consider termination if there is a nexus between the developer’s actions\nor business practices in relation to the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements\nand the functionality of the affected certified Health IT Module(s). For example, as discussed in\nthe Proposed Rule, ONC may determine that a health IT developer is violating a Condition of\nCertification requirement due to a clause in its contracts that prevents its users from sharing or\ndiscussing technological impediments to information exchange. In this example, the health IT\ndeveloper’s conduct would violate the Communications Condition of Certification requirement\nthat we have finalized in § 170.403. If the same conduct were also found to impair the\nfunctionality of the certified Health IT Module (such as by preventing the proper use of certified\ncapabilities for the exchange of EHI), ONC may determine that a nexus exists between the\ndeveloper’s business practices and the functionality of the certified Health IT Module, and may\nconsider termination of the certificate(s) of that particular Health IT Module under the proposed\napproach.\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed this approach, which allows ONC to initiate a certification ban and/or\ncertificate termination under certain circumstances, to ensure that health IT developers are acting\nin accordance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. However, we\nstressed that our first and foremost priority is to work with health IT developers to remedy any\nnoncompliance with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements through a\ncorrective action process before taking further action. This emphasizes ONC’s desire to promote\nand support health IT developer compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements, and ensure that certified health IT is compliant with Program requirements, in order\nto foster an environment where EHI is exchanged in an interoperable way.\n\nWe proposed in 84 FR 7505 that in considering whether termination of a Health IT\nModule’s certificate(s) and/or a certification ban is appropriate, ONC would consider factors\nincluding, but not limited to: whether the health IT developer has previously been found in\nnoncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification or other Program\nrequirements; the severity and pervasiveness of the noncompliance, including the effect of the\nnoncompliance on widespread interoperability and health information exchange; the extent to\nwhich the health IT developer cooperates with ONC to review the noncompliance; the extent of\npotential negative impact on providers who may seek to use the certified health IT to participate\nin CMS programs; and whether termination and/or a certification ban is necessary to ensure the\nintegrity of the certification process.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we noted in 84 FR 7505 that, as found in § 170.580(f)(2), ONC\nwould provide notice of the termination to the health IT developer, including providing an\nexplanation for, information supporting, and consequences of, the termination, as well as\ninstructions for appealing the termination. We proposed to add substantially similar notice\nprovisions to § 170.581 for certification bans issued under ONC direct review for noncompliance\n\n\n\n\nwith the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. These provisions would also\ninclude instructions for requesting reinstatement. In this regard, in 84 FR 7505 we proposed to\napply the current reinstatement procedures under § 170.581 to certification bans resulting from\nnoncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, but with an\nadditional requirement that the health IT developer has resolved the noncompliance with the\nCondition or Maintenance of Certification requirement. In sum, we proposed that a health IT\ndeveloper could seek ONC’s approval to re-enter the Program and have the certification ban lifted\nif it demonstrates that it has resolved the noncompliance with the Condition or Maintenance of\nCertification requirement, and ONC is satisfied that all affected customers have been provided\nappropriate remediation. We sought comment on whether ONC should impose a minimum time\nperiod for a certification ban, such as when a health IT developer is noncompliant with a\nCondition or Maintenance of Certification requirement more than once (e.g., a minimum six\nmonths for two instances, a minimum of one year for three instances). We also sought comment\non whether additional factors should be considered for a certification ban and/or termination of a\nhealth IT developer’s certified health IT.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments regarding a minimum ban length for repeat\noffenders. A couple of the commenters recommended ONC establish a minimum ban and agreed\nwith ONC’s examples listed above. Other commenters stated that a minimum ban would not be\nappropriate, with one commenter stating that a minimum ban could have unintended\nconsequences and another commenter stating that it would be better if the length of the ban was\ndetermined situationally.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the provisions regarding termination and certification ban in\n§§ 170.580 and 170.581 as proposed. We have not established a minimum ban length for repeat\noffenders, as a reinstatement process has been established in § 170.581(d) that affords ONC the\n\n\n\n\ndiscretion to determine whether a developer has demonstrated appropriate remediation to all\ncustomers affected by the certificate termination, certificate withdrawal, or noncompliance with\na Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement. Section 170.581(d)(4) allows ONC to\ngrant reinstatement into the Program if ONC is satisfied with a health IT developer’s\ndemonstration of appropriate remediation, and ONC may consider any and all factors, including\npast bans, that may affect ONC’s decision to grant reinstatement into the Program.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments expressing concern for how physicians using\nproducts whose developer has been banned would be impacted with respect to payment programs.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and clarify that the health IT products of a\nhealth IT developer under a certification ban (not certificate termination) would still be considered\ncertified. This means that those products would still be available for use by providers participating\nin programs requiring the use of certified health IT. However, while under a ban, a health IT\ndeveloper could not make updates to the certification of those products. This means that access to\nnew certified functionalities within a health IT developer’s products would be limited. If the\ncertification status of a product may impact health care providers that are users of that product for\nHHS program participation, ONC would continue to support HHS and other Federal and State\npartners, such as CMS, to help identify and make available appropriate remedies for users of\nterminated certified health IT. This would include supporting policies to mitigate negative impacts\non providers, such as the availability of hardship exceptions for the Promoting Interoperability\n(PI) Programs for hospitals as mandated by section 4002(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) of the 21st Century\nCures Act and finalized by CMS in the FY 2018 Inpatient Prospective Payment System final rule\n(80 FR 38488 through 38490).\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment that ONC should add a fine as part of the\nenforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment, but ONC does not have the authority to add a\nmonetary fine as part of the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. We note, however, that health IT developers are subject to civil monetary\npenalties (CMPs) if they engage in information blocking, and that a health IT developer must not\ntake any action that constitutes information blocking as a Condition of Certification requirement\n(§ 170.401).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that certification bans apply not only to health\nIT developers who are noncompliant, but also to the individual management representatives\ninvolved, and that account migration review plans be required as an aspect of enforcement in\norder to address issues around creation of new legal entities in response to a certification ban.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and note that certification bans affect health IT\ndevelopers participating in the Program, their subsidiaries, and their successors (81 FR 72443).\n\nWe do not have the authority to regulate or enforce against individual management\nrepresentatives, though we believe the certification ban’s reach is an appropriate and sufficient\nincentive for health IT developers to resolve any noncompliance and meet all required conditions.\n\nAs stated previously, we are utilizing processes previously established for ONC direct review of\ncertified health IT for the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements, which we believe are familiar to health IT developers and provide a transparent\nprocess for working with health IT developers to remedy instances of noncompliance.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern that there is no process for measuring the\nseverity of a finding of noncompliance, and ONC’s proposed enforcement approach would allow\nfor banning of all of a health IT developer’s certified health IT based on a finding of\nnoncompliance. The commenter requested that the final rule specify circumstances that could lead\nto this serious result.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment and clarify that, as proposed, if a health IT\ndeveloper under ONC direct review for noncompliance with a Condition of Certification\nrequirement failed to work with ONC to correct the noncompliance, or was noncompliant with\nthe requirements of the CAP, ONC could issue a certification ban. However, we stress that our\npriority is to first work with health IT developers to correct any noncompliance with the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements through corrective action. As stated in\nthe Proposed Rule in 84 FR 7505, factors we would consider prior to issuing a certification ban,\nor termination of a Health IT Module’s certificate, include whether the health IT developer has\npreviously been found in noncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements or other Program requirements; the severity and pervasiveness of the\nnoncompliance; cooperation on the part of the health IT developer during ONC review; potential\nnegative impact on providers participating in CMS programs; and whether termination and/or a\ncertification ban is necessary to ensure the integrity of the certification process.\n\nWe clarify that while under a CAP or surveillance by ONC or an ONC-ACB, in the event\na health IT developer’s approach to remedy a non-conformity and/or to meet Program\nrequirements is to withdraw their current certificate(s) for replacement with a new certificate\nissued by the ONC-ACB to reflect a new scope, they will not be subject to a certification ban. We\nnote that any open non-conformities will be transferred to the newly issued certificate(s) and must\nstill be resolved by the health IT developer. Similarly, when an ONC-ACB issues a new\ncertificate to reflect 2015 Edition changes, and must withdraw a health IT developer’s current\ncertificate to do so, the health IT developer will not be subject to a certification ban if the\ndeveloper is currently under a CAP or has health IT with open non-conformities.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that in instances of information blocking, the\ntermination of a Health IT Module’s certificate or issuance of a certification ban should not\n\n\n\n\noccur until the health IT developer has had the opportunity to respond to the charge of\ninformation blocking and appeal the finding.\n\n*Response.* As stated previously, we have finalized in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 our\nproposed approach to utilize the processes previously established for ONC direct review of\ncertified health IT for the enforcement of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements. These processes are open and transparent, and they provide an opportunity for\nhealth IT developers to remedy instances of noncompliance through corrective action. We again\nstress that it is our priority to first work with health IT developers to correct any noncompliance\nwith the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements through corrective action.\n\nWe believe these processes provide ample opportunity for a health IT developer to respond to\nand address information blocking prior to issuance of a certification ban or termination of a\nHealth IT Module’s certificate.\n\n*Comments.* We received one comment stating that the final rule should provide for an\nemergency remedy when the blocking of information places an individual at risk of immediate\nharm.\n\n*Response.* Our current process for direct review enables ONC to respond appropriately in\nthe case of certified health IT that may be causing or contributing to conditions that present a\nserious risk to public health or safety (§§ 170.580(a)(2)(i) and 170.580(d)(1)). We also refer\nreaders to the information blocking section in this final rule (section VIII of preamble and Part\n171) for a detailed discussion regarding the information blocking provision and the exceptions to\nthe information blocking definition, including those designed to prevent harm to patients and\nothers.\n\n\n",

We take this same approach for\nhealth IT with terminated certifications (see 81 FR 72438). Public listing serves to discourage\nnoncompliance with Conditions and Maintenance of Certification and other Program\nrequirements, while encouraging cooperation with ONC and ONC-ACBs and remediation of\nnon-conformities.

The pre-Cures Act structure and requirements of the Program\nprovide processes to enforce compliance with technical and functional requirements of\ncertified health IT, and to a more limited extent, requirements for the business practices of\nhealth IT developers (see, e.g., 45 CFR 170.523(k)(1)) under subparts C (Certification Criteria\nfor Health Information Technology) and E (ONC Health IT Certification Program) of Part\n170. ONC-ACBs are required to perform surveillance on certified Health IT Modules and may\ninvestigate reported allegations of non-conformities with Program requirements under\nsubparts A, B, C, and E, with the ultimate goal of working with the health IT developer to\ncorrect the non-conformity. Under certain circumstances, such as unsafe conditions or\nimpediments to ONC-ACB oversight, ONC may directly review certified health IT to\ndetermine whether it conforms to the requirements of the Program (see § 170.580 and the\nEOA final rule at 81 FR 72404). These avenues for investigating non-conformities with\ncertified Health IT Modules will continue to exist under the Program and generally focus on\nfunctionality and performance of certified health IT, or on more limited requirements of\nbusiness practices of health IT developers found in subparts A, B, C and E of Part 170,\nrespectively. Thus, there may be instances where one or more Condition or Maintenance of\n\n\n\n\nCertification requirement is not being or has not been met that also relate to certified Health IT\nModule non-conformities under subparts A, B, C and E. We proposed that under these\nsituations, ONC could in parallel implement both sets of processes – existing processes to\ninvestigate Health IT Module non-conformities and the proposed process to enforce\ncompliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements. We stressed,\nhowever, that under the proposed enforcement approach, only ONC would have the ability to\ndetermine whether a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement per subpart D has\nbeen or is being met.\n\nWe proposed to delineate the scope of an ONC-ACB’s requirements to perform\nsurveillance on certified Health IT Modules as related only to the requirements of subparts A,\nB, C and E of Part 170. Given our proposed approach that would authorize solely ONC to\ndetermine whether a Conditions or Maintenance of Certification requirement per subpart D\nhas been or is being met, we proposed in 84 FR 7506 to add a new PoPC for ONC-ACBs in §\n170.523(s) that would require ONC-ACBs to report to ONC, no later than a week after\nbecoming aware, any information that could inform whether ONC should exercise direct\nreview for noncompliance with a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement or\nany matter within the scope of ONC direct review. We did not receive specific comments on\nthis section of the Proposed Rule and have finalized this approach regarding delineation of the\nreview activities of ONC and ONC-ACBs in §§ 170.580 and 170.581 as proposed.\n\n\n",

Notably, section 3022(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the PHSA, as\nadded by the Cures Act, authorizes the OIG to investigate claims that a health IT developer of\ncertified health IT has engaged in information blocking, which is defined by section 3022(a)(1)\nof the PHSA as subject to reasonable and necessary activities identified by the Secretary as\nexceptions to the definition as proposed in part 171 (see section VIII.D of this final rule).\n\nAdditionally, section 3022(b)(1)(A)(i) authorizes OIG to investigate claims that a health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT has submitted a false attestation under the Condition of\nCertification requirement which is described at section 3001(c)(5)(D)(vi) of the Cures Act. We\nemphasized that ONC’s and OIG’s respective authorities under the Cures Act (and in general)\nare independent and that either or both offices may exercise those authorities at any time.\n\nWe noted, however, that ONC and OIG may coordinate their respective information\nblocking activities, as appropriate, such as by sharing information about claims or suggestions\nof possible information blocking or false attestations (including violations of Conditions and\nMaintenance of Certification requirements that may indicate that a developer has falsely\nattested to meeting a Condition or Maintenance of Certification requirement). Therefore, we\nproposed in 84 FR 7507 that we may coordinate our review of a claim of information blocking\nwith OIG or defer to OIG to lead a review of a claim of information blocking. In addition, we\nproposed that we may rely on OIG’s findings to form the basis of a direct review action.\n\n*Comments.* The majority of comments received supported the general enforcement\napproach proposed by ONC. We did receive one comment recommending that we use a\nprocess similar to OCR’s enforcement of the HIPAA Rules and centralize enforcement of\npatient and provider rights with respect to privacy and access to EHI. Additionally, we\nreceived several comments seeking clarification regarding ONC’s coordination with OIG and\none expressing concern about the potential for a developer to be under review by both OIG\n\n\n\n\nand ONC for the same conduct.\n\n*Response.* We welcome the many comments in support of our proposed enforcement\napproach. We also appreciate the comment regarding using processes similar to OCR and\ncentralizing enforcement of privacy and access rights. We agree that it is crucial that we\ndevelop clear processes for reporting and investigating claims of potential information\nblocking. To that end, ONC and OIG are actively coordinating on establishing referral policies\nand procedures to ensure the timely and appropriate flow of information related to information\nblocking complaints. We also note that the information blocking section of this final rule (part\n171) has a delayed compliance date of 6 months after date of publication of the final rule.\n\nOIG and ONC are also coordinating timing of the effective date of this final rule and the\nstart of information blocking enforcement and enforcement of the Conditions of Certification\nrelated to information blocking (§ 170.401, § 170.404(a)(1), and § 170.406(a)(1)). We are\nproviding the following information on timing for actors regulated by the information blocking\nprovision. Enforcement of information blocking civil monetary penalties (CMP) in section\n3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA will not begin until established by future notice and comment\nrulemaking by OIG. As a result, actors would not be subject to penalties until CMP rules are final.\n\nAt a minimum, the timeframe for enforcement would not begin sooner than the compliance date\nof the information blocking provision and will depend on when the CMP rules are final.\n\nDiscretion will be exercised such that conduct that occurs before that time will not be subject to\nthe information blocking CMPs. Individuals and entities are subject to the information blocking\nregulations and must comply with this rule as of the compliance date of this provision.\n\nThe Cures Act directs the National Coordinator to implement a standardized process for\nthe public to submit reports on claims of health information blocking. ONC intends to implement\nand evolve this complaint process by building on existing mechanisms, including the current\n\n\n\n\nONC complaint process. We requested comment in the Proposed Rule on ways to adapt our\ncurrent complaint process for claims of information blocking and refer readers to section VIII.F of\nthis final rule for a more detailed discussion of the complaint process for claims of information\nblocking. OIG also has the ability to receive and review complaints directly from the public. This\nensures that there is no “wrong door” by which a complainant can submit information. OIG will\nprovide training to allow their investigators to identify information blocking allegations as part of\ntheir other fraud and abuse investigations. Additionally, as part of their continued efforts to\nimplement the information blocking authorities, OIG will establish policies and procedures for\nreviewing and triaging complaints. We will continue to work with OIG to establish coordinated\nand aligned procedures and reviews of information blocking complaints as envisioned by the\nCures Act. We also emphasize that in order to promote effective enforcement, the information\nblocking provision of the Cures Act empowers OIG to investigate claims of information blocking\nand provides referral processes to facilitate coordination with other relevant agencies, including\nONC, OCR, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Future notice and comment rulemaking\nby OIG will provide more additional detail regarding information blocking enforcement.\n\nWe clarify that there could be situations when a health IT developer of certified health\nIT’s practices could be reviewed by both ONC and OIG because ONC and OIG have separate\nand distinct enforcement authority regarding claims of information blocking. We explained in\nthe Proposed Rule that ONC has statutory authority to enforce the Information Blocking\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirements (§ 170.401) and that ONC would\nenforce the Conditions of Certification requirements through the direct review process. OIG\nhas investigatory authority for the information blocking provision (42 U.S.C. 300jj-52(b)),\nwhich may lead to the issuance of (CMPs) for information blocking conducted by health IT\ndevelopers of certified health IT, health information networks, and health information\n\n\n\n\nexchanges. OIG may also investigate health care providers for information blocking, which\ncould result in health care providers being subject to appropriate disincentives. In addition,\nOIG may investigate false attestations by health IT developers participating in the Program.\n\nSince ONC’s and OIG’s respective authorities with regard to information blocking under the\nCures Act (and in general) are independent, it is necessary that either or both offices may\nexercise those authorities at any time.\n\nHowever, we emphasize, as we explained above in the Proposed Rule, that we anticipate\nthat ONC and OIG will coordinate their respective information blocking activities, as appropriate,\nsuch as by sharing information about claims or suggestions of possible information blocking or\nfalse attestations (including violations of Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements that may indicate that a developer has falsely attested to meeting a Condition or\nMaintenance of Certification requirement). Therefore, we have finalized in § 170.580(a)(4) the\nproposed approach that will allow us to coordinate our review of a claim of information blocking\nwith the OIG, or defer to OIG to lead a review of a claim of information blocking. In addition, the\nfinalized approach will allow ONC to rely on OIG findings to form the basis of a direct review\naction.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We explained in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision was\nenacted in response to concerns that some individuals and entities are engaging in practices\nthat unreasonably limit the availability and use of electronic health information (EHI) for\nauthorized and permitted purposes. These practices undermine public and private sector\ninvestments in the nation’s health IT infrastructure, and frustrate efforts to use modern\ntechnologies to improve health care quality and efficiency, accelerate research and innovation,\nand provide greater value and choice to health care consumers (84 FR 7508).\n\nWe emphasized that the nature and extent of information blocking has come into sharp\nfocus in recent years. In 2015, at the request of Congress, we submitted a Report on Health\n\n\n\n\nInformation Blocking117\n(“Information Blocking Congressional Report”), in which we\ncommented on the then-current state of technology and of health IT and health care markets.\n\nNotably, we observed that prevailing market conditions create incentives for some individuals\nand entities to exercise control over EHI in ways that limit its availability and use (84 FR\n7508).\n\nWe noted that we have continued to receive complaints and reports of information\nblocking from patients, clinicians, health care executives, payers, app developers and other\ntechnology companies, registries and health information exchanges, professional and trade\nassociations, and many other stakeholders. We noted that ONC has listened to and reviewed\nthese complaints and reports, consulted with stakeholders, and solicited input from our Federal\npartners in order to inform our proposed information blocking policies. Stakeholders described\ndiscriminatory pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect of excluding\ncompetitors from the use of interoperability elements. Many industry stakeholders who shared\ntheir perspectives with us in listening sessions, including several health IT developers of\ncertified health IT, condemned these practices and urged us to swiftly address them. We\nhighlighted that our engagement with stakeholders confirmed that, despite significant public\nand private sector efforts to improve interoperability and data accessibility, adverse incentives\nremain and continue to undermine progress toward a more connected health system (84 FR\n7508).\n\nBased on these economic realities and our first-hand experience working with the\nhealth IT industry and stakeholders, in the Information Blocking Congressional Report, we\n117\nONC, Report to Congress on Health Information Blocking (Apr. 2015),\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf [hereinafter “Information Blocking\nCongressional Report”].\n\n\n\n\nconcluded that information blocking is a serious problem, and recommended that Congress\nprohibit information blocking and provide penalties and enforcement mechanisms to deter\nthese harmful practices (84 FR 7508).\n\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule that recent empirical and economic research further\nunderscores the intractability of this problem and its harmful effects. In a national survey of\nhealth information organizations, half of respondents reported that EHR developers routinely\nengage in information blocking, and a quarter of respondents reported that hospitals and health\nsystems routinely do so. The survey reported that perceived motivations for such conduct\nincluded, for EHR vendors, maximizing short-term revenue and competing for new clients,\nand for hospitals and health systems, strengthening their competitive position relative to other\nhospitals and health systems.118\nWe noted that other research suggests that these practices\nweaken competition among health care providers by limiting patient mobility, encouraging\nconsolidation, and creating barriers to entry for developers of new and innovative applications\n(also referred to as “apps”) and technologies that enable more effective uses of clinical data to\nimprove population health and the patient experience119\n(84 FR 7508).\n\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision provides a\ncomprehensive response to these concerns. The information blocking provision defines and\ncreates possible penalties and disincentives for information blocking in broad terms, while\n118\nSee, e.g., Julia Adler-Milstein and Eric Pfeifer, Information Blocking: Is It Occurring And What Policy Strategies\nCan Address It?, 95 Milbank Quarterly 117, 124–25 (Mar. 2017), available at\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12247/full.\n\n119\nSee, e.g., Martin Gaynor, Farzad Mostashari, and Paul B.

The information blocking provision applies\nto the conduct of health care providers and health IT developers, exchanges, and networks,\nand seeks to deter information blocking through civil monetary penalties and disincentives for\nviolations. Additionally, developers of health IT certified under the Program are prohibited\nfrom information blocking under 3001(c)(5)(D)(i) of the PHSA (84 FR 7509).\n\nThe information blocking provision authorizes the HHS Office of Inspector General\n(OIG) to investigate claims of information blocking and provides for referral processes to\nfacilitate coordination among Federal agencies, including ONC, the HHS Office for Civil\nRights (OCR), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The information blocking provision\nalso provides for a process for the public to submit reports on claims of information blocking\nas well as confidentiality protections to encourage and facilitate the reporting of information\nblocking. Enforcement of the information blocking provision is buttressed by section\n3001(c)(5)(D)(i) and (vi) of the PHSA, which requires the Secretary to establish as a\nCondition and Maintenance of Certification requirement under the Program that health IT\ndevelopers do not take any action that constitutes information blocking and require such\ndevelopers to attest that they have not engaged in such conduct (84 FR 7509).\n\n\n",

              "text": "We explained in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision\nencompasses a broad range of potential practices in order to ensure that individuals and\nentities that engage in information blocking are held accountable. However, we explained that\nit is possible that some activities that are innocuous, or even beneficial, could technically\nimplicate the information blocking provision. Given the possibility of these activities, section\n3022(a)(3) of the PHSA requires the Secretary, through rulemaking, to identify reasonable and\n\n\n\n\nnecessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. We refer to such reasonable\nand necessary activities identified by the Secretary as “exceptions” to the information\nblocking provision. The information blocking provision also excludes from the definition of\ninformation blocking those practices that are required by law (section 3022(a)(1) of the\nPHSA) and clarifies certain other practices that would either not be considered information\nblocking or penalized (sections 3022(a)(6) and (7) of the PHSA) (84 FR 7509).\n\nIn considering potential exceptions to the information blocking provision, we strove to\nbalance a number of policy and practical considerations. To minimize compliance and other\nburdens for stakeholders, we explained that we were seeking to promote clear, predictable,\nand administrable policies. In addition, we emphasized our intention to implement the\ninformation blocking provision in a way that would be sensitive to legitimate practical\nchallenges that may prevent access to, exchange, or use of EHI in certain situations. We also\nexplained our goal to accommodate practices that, while they may inhibit access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI, are reasonable and necessary to advance other compelling policy interests, such as\npreventing harm to patients and others, promoting the privacy and security of EHI, and\npromoting competition and consumer welfare (84 FR 7509).\n\nAt the same time, we explained that we sought to provide a comprehensive response to\nthe information blocking problem. Information blocking can occur through a variety of\nbusiness, technical, and organizational practices that can be difficult to detect and that are\nconstantly changing as technology and industry conditions evolve. The statute responds to\nthese challenges by defining information blocking broadly and in a manner that allows for\ncareful consideration of relevant facts and circumstances in individual cases.\n\nAccordingly, we proposed in the Proposed Rule to establish certain defined exceptions\nto the information blocking provision as a way to identify reasonable and necessary activities\n\n\n\n\nthat do not constitute information blocking as required by section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA. We\nproposed that these exceptions would be subject to strict conditions and would apply three\noverarching policy criteria. First, each exception would be limited to certain activities that are\nboth reasonable and necessary. These reasonable and necessary activities include: promoting\npublic confidence in the health IT infrastructure by supporting the privacy and security of EHI\nand protecting patient safety; and promoting competition and innovation in health IT and its\nuse to provide health care services to consumers. Second, we noted that each exception\naddresses a significant risk that regulated individuals and entities will not engage in these\nreasonable and necessary activities because of uncertainty regarding the breadth or\napplicability of the information blocking provision. Third, we explained that each exception is\nintended to be tailored, through appropriate conditions, so that it is limited to the reasonable\nand necessary activities that it is designed to protect and does not extend protection to other\nactivities or practices that could raise information blocking concerns (84 FR 7509).\n\n\n",

          "text": "*Comments.* Numerous commenters expressed support for the proposed information\nblocking exceptions overall. Some commenters stated that information blocking is a\nwidespread problem and perhaps the greatest barrier to interoperability, and supported our\napproach to addressing information blocking.\n\nWhile most commenters supported our policy goals regarding information blocking,\nothers questioned whether our policies would have detrimental consequences to the industry\ngiven the breadth of the definitions, ambiguity of the expectations, and narrowness of the\nproposed exceptions. Another commenter stated that the proposed information blocking\nexceptions are too vague and that an alternative approach is necessary to reduce confusion.\n\nThe commenter stated that we should align the information blocking requirements with the\n\n\n\n\ncertified capabilities of health IT developers, and that information blocking should be\nevaluated through the lens of access, exchange, and use of the USCDI. One commenter\nsuggested that our information blocking policies be more patient-focused as offered by the\nIndividual Health Record™ (IHR) Model.120\nA few commenters requested clarification on\nhow each of the exceptions would be arbitrated, and requested that we provide additional\nexamples of actions that may fall within each exception.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support expressed by many commenters. This final rule\nmaintains the general direction of the Proposed Rule regarding information blocking but\nfocuses the scope of certain terms, while also addressing the reasonable and necessary\nactivities that would qualify for an exception under the information blocking provision. As an\nexample, we have focused the scope of the EHI and Health Information Network (HIN)\ndefinitions and have included a new exception in this final rule, the Content and Manner\nException (§ 171.301). We appreciate the comment regarding the IHR Model, but have\ndetermined that the best approach to support interoperability and the access, exchange, and\nuse of EHI is through the policies finalized in this final rule, which are patient-focused. For\ninstance, the Fees Exception (§ 171.302), which allows certain fees to be charged, does not\napply to a fee based in any part on the electronic access (as such term is defined in §\n171.302(d)) of an individual’s EHI by the individual, their personal representative, or another\nperson or entity designated by the individual. We emphasize that an actor’s practice of\ncharging an individual, their personal representative, or another person or entity designated by\nthe individual for electronic access to the individual’s EHI would be inherently suspect under\nan information blocking review.\n\n120\nThe IHR is a digital tool that provides an all-in-one record of an individual’s health, enabling a person and their\ncare team to help improve collaboration and care.\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to receive complaints and reports alleging information blocking from a\nwide range of stakeholders. ONC has listened to and reviewed these complaints and reports,\nconsulted with stakeholders, solicited input from our Federal partners, and reviewed public\ncomments received in response to the Proposed Rule in order to inform our information\nblocking policies. We look forward to ongoing collaboration with public and private sector\npartners as we implement the information blocking provision of this final rule. To note, we\nhave provided clarifications and additional examples throughout this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* Numerous commenters expressed concern over the proposed effective date\nof the information blocking policies. Commenters stated that imposing stringent new\nmandates with an overly aggressive implementation timeframe could be counterproductive by\nincreasing administrative and financial burdens on physician practices, threatening the\nsecurity of health information, and potentially compromising patient safety. Several provider\norganizations requested an enforcement “grace period” after the new information blocking\nrequirements take effect to allow providers sufficient time to understand the requirements and\nimplement new procedures to be compliant before any disincentives would be applied.\n\nSpecifically, commenters recommended that OIG not take any enforcement action for a period\nof 18 months or two years after the effective date of the final rule. Several commenters\nrecommended a period of enforcement discretion of no less than five years during which OIG\nwould require corrective action plans instead of imposing penalties for information blocking.\n\nOne commenter also recommended that we “grandfather” any economic arrangements that\nexist two years from date of the final rule.\n\nWe did not receive any comments on the proposed § 171.101, Applicability, which\nstated that this part applies to health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT,\nhealth information exchanges, and health information networks, as those terms are defined in\n\n\n\n\n§ 171.102.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. Taking these comments into\nconsideration, we have delayed the compliance date of the information blocking section of this\nrule (45 CFR part 171). The compliance date for the information blocking section of this final\nrule will be six months after the publication date of this final rule in the Federal Register. This\nsix-month delayed compliance date was established to provide actors with time to thoroughly\nread and understand the final rule and educate their workforce in order to apply the exceptions\nin an appropriate manner. We also note that the finalized definition of information blocking (§\n171.103)) and the new Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301(a)) reduce the scope of the\nEHI definition for the first 18 months after the compliance date of the information blocking\nsection of this final rule to the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the USCDI.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the information blocking section’s compliance date being six months\nafter publication, actors will have an additional 18 months to gain experience applying the\nexceptions with just the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the USCDI as\ncompared to the full scope of EHI, which would apply thereafter.\n\nDuring this combined period of 24 months, we strongly encourage actors to apply the\nexceptions to all EHI as if the scope were not limited to EHI identified by the data elements\nrepresented in the USCDI. However, given the initial scope of EHI identified in the\ninformation blocking definition in § 171.103 and the Content and Manner Exception in §\n171.103, if an actor did not, in the first 24 months from this final rule’s publication date,\nenable access, exchange, or use of data outside the USCDI, or did not appropriately apply an\nexception to data outside the USCDI, such practice or error would not be considered\ninformation blocking because that data would not be considered “EHI” during that time\nperiod.\n\n\n\n\nWe have also delayed the compliance date of the Information Blocking Condition of\nCertification requirement in § 170.401 and the Assurances Condition of Certification\nrequirement in § 170.402(a)(1). We also note that under 45 CFR part 171, we have focused\nthe scope of the EHI definition and have revised the seven proposed exceptions in a manner\nthat is clear, actionable, and likely to reduce perceived burden.\n\nOIG and ONC are coordinating timing of the compliance date of the information blocking\nsection of this final rule (45 CFR part 171) and the start of information blocking enforcement. We\nare providing the following information on timing for actors. Enforcement of information\nblocking civil monetary penalties (CMP) in section 3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA will not begin\nuntil established by future notice and comment rulemaking by OIG. As a result, actors would not\nbe subject to penalties until CMP rules are final. At a minimum, the timeframe for enforcement\nwould not begin sooner than the compliance date of the information blocking section of this final\nrule (45 CFR part 171) and will depend on when the CMP rules are final. Discretion will be\nexercised such that conduct that occurs before that time will not be subject to information\nblocking CMP.\n\nWe have finalized § 171.101 with an additional paragraph to codify the compliance\ndate for the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR part 171). Section\n171.101(b) states that health care providers, health IT developers of certified health IT, health\ninformation exchanges, and health information networks must comply with this part on and\nafter November 2, 2020.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that we develop training and educational\nmaterials on the information blocking provision. Commenters specifically stated that we\nshould work with other agencies (including CMS, OIG, FTC and OCR) to develop and widely\ndisseminate comprehensive informational materials, such as sub-regulatory guidance and\n\n\n\n\nfrequently asked questions about what constitutes information blocking. Some commenters\nrecommended we work with OIG to ensure that enforcement focuses on education rather than\npenalties against non-malicious information blockers. A few commenters suggested that we\noffer an opportunity for stakeholders to seek advisory opinions from OIG to clarify what\nconstitutes information blocking, or that we create a formal advisory committee on\ninformation blocking. Other commenters requested that heath care providers be provided an\nopportunity to cure an alleged violation and an opportunity to appeal the alleged violation.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback, including their suggestions for\nestablishing a formal advisory committee. While we do not plan to establish an advisory\ncommittee, we plan to engage in multiple efforts to educate stakeholders. We intend to provide\neducational resources such as infographics, fact sheets, webinars, and other forms of educational\nmaterials and outreach based on needs identified. We emphasize that the final rule details our\ninformation blocking policies, and these educational materials are intended to educate\nstakeholders on our final policies established in the final rule. We are also actively coordinating\nwith OIG and have provided OIG with comments we received on the Proposed Rule related to\ninformation blocking investigations and enforcement. Future notice and comment rulemaking by\nOIG will provide additional detail regarding information blocking enforcement.\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the Proposed Rule, we included regulation text to codify the definition of\ninformation blocking in § 171.103. We discussed how we proposed to interpret certain aspects\nof the information blocking provision that we believe are ambiguous, incomplete, or that\nprovided the Secretary with discretion. We proposed to define or interpret certain terms or\nconcepts that are present in the statute and, in a few instances, to establish new regulatory\nterms or definitions that we believe are necessary to implement the directive in section\n\n\n\n\n3022(a)(3) of the PHSA to identify reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute\ninformation blocking. We explained that our goal in interpreting the statute and defining\nrelevant terms is to provide greater clarity concerning the types of practices that could\nimplicate the information blocking provision and, relatedly, to more effectively communicate\nthe applicability and scope of the exceptions (84 FR 7509).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on the codification of the proposed\ndefinition of information blocking in § 171.103.\n\nAs discussed in more detail in section VIII.C.3, we received many comments\nexpressing concerns regarding the breadth of the proposed EHI definition and requesting\nflexibility in the implementation of the information blocking provision. Many commenters\nstated that it would be difficult for actors to provide the full scope of EHI as it was proposed to\nbe defined, particularly as soon as the final rule was published. Some commenters opined that\nwe were trying to do too much too fast. Commenters requested that we provide flexibility for\nactors to adjust to the scope of the EHI definition, as well as the exceptions. Commenters\nasserted that such an approach would permit them to adapt their processes, technologies, and\nsystems to enable the access, exchange, and use of EHI as required by the Cures Act and this\nfinal rule. Some commenters suggested that EHI under the information blocking provision\nshould be limited to ePHI as defined in 45 CFR 160.103, while others requested that ONC\nconsider constraining the EHI covered by the information blocking provision to only the data\nincluded in the USCDI.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the proposed definition of information blocking in §\n171.103 with the addition of paragraph (b). This new paragraph states that until May 2,\n2022—which is 18 months after the 6-month delayed compliance date for part 171 (a total of\n24 months after the publication date of this final rule)—EHI for purposes of part 171 is limited\n\n\n\n\nto the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the United States Core Data for\nInteroperability (USCDI) standard adopted in § 170.213. This addition aligns with the content\ncondition within the Content and Manner Exception, which states that for up to May 2, 2022,\nan actor must respond to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI with, at a minimum, the\nEHI identified by the data elements represented in the USCDI standard adopted in § 170.213\n(see § 171.301(a)(1)).\n\nThis incremental expansion of the access, exchange, and use of EHI in both the\ninformation blocking definition (§ 171.103) and Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301)\nresponds to commenters’ concerns regarding the breadth of health information actors are\nrequired to share and the concern about the pace at which we are implementing the\ninformation blocking provision. By using USCDI as the baseline of EHI for 18 months after\nthe compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR part 171),121\nwe have created a transparent, predictable starting point for sharing the types of EHI that is\nunderstood by the regulated community and more readily available for access, exchange, and\nuse. In addition, health IT that has been certified to the 2015 Edition “CCDS” certification\ncriteria will be able to immediately and readily produce almost all of the data elements\nidentified in the USCDI. Furthermore, most, if not all, of such health IT already supports\nrecording USCDI data elements and most HIEs/HINs are routinely exchanging such data\nelements. Further those developers maintaining certification over the 18-month period from\nthe compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR part 171)\nwill be in the process of updating their certified health IT to produce all of the data elements\nspecified in the USCDI, including being certified to the new standardized application\n121\nThe compliance date for the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR part 171) is six months after\nthe publication date of the final rule.\n\n\n\n\nprogramming interface (API) criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)) and API Condition of Certification\n(§ 170.404).\n\nWe believe the 18-month delay will provide actors with adequate time to prepare for\nthe sharing of all EHI and sunset any non-compliant technology, while providing a clear\ndeadline for when all EHI must be available for access, exchange, and use. During this time\nperiod, actors can gain awareness, experience, and comfort with the information blocking\nprovision and exceptions without being required to apply the information blocking exceptions\nto all EHI as it is defined in § 171.102 (see section VIII.C.3). We expect actors to use this 18-\nmonth delay from the compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule\n(45 CFR part 171) (in addition to the 6-month period from the publication date of this final\nrule to the information blocking compliance date) to practice applying the exceptions to real-\nlife situations and to update their processes, technologies, and systems to adapt to the new\ninformation blocking requirements. We believe actors will benefit from learning how to\nrespond to requests for all EHI and applying the exceptions during the 18-month delay.\n\nFurther, this approach will ensure that the application of the information blocking\nprovision is equitable across actors during the 18-month time period. For instance, if we had\nrequired actors to respond to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI during this 18-month\ntime period with all EHI that the actor is able to provide, then actors who are able to provide\nmore EHI would carry a heavier burden than actors who were only able to provide the data\nelements specified in the USCDI. Nonetheless, and as discussed above, we encourage actors\nto respond to requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI with as much EHI as possible in\norder to promote interoperability and to practice applying the exceptions.\n\nWe have included language regarding this incremental expansion of the access,\nexchange, and use of EHI in both the information blocking definition (§ 171.103) and Content\n\n\n\n\nand Manner Exception (§ 171.301) in order to ensure that the 18-month delay is uniformly\napplied in the broad circumstances when requestors request access, exchange, or use of EHI as\nwell as in situations when an actor seeks to satisfy the Content and Manner Exception by\nfulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in an alternative manner than the manner\nrequested. This approach will ensure that the requisite content to be included in an actor’s\nresponse to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI during the 18-month period is clear and\nconsistent throughout our information blocking policies.\n\n\n",

By carving out practices that are “required by\nlaw,” the statute acknowledged that there are laws that advance important policy interests and\nobjectives by restricting access, exchange, and use of EHI, and that practices that follow such\nlaws should not be considered information blocking (84 FR 7509).\n\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule that for the purpose of developing an exception for\nreasonable and necessary privacy-protective practices, we distinguished between interferences\nthat are “required by law” and those engaged in pursuant to a privacy law, but which are not\n“required by law.” (The former does not fall within the definition of information blocking, but\nthe latter may implicate the information blocking provision and an exception may be\nnecessary (84 FR 7510)).\n\n*Comments.* We received comments requesting additional clarity regarding the meaning\nand scope of “required by law” within the information blocking provision.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the feedback.

                  "text": "\n\n\n\nWe identified in the Proposed Rule that the term “health care provider” is defined in\nsection 3000(3) of the PHSA (84 FR 7510). We proposed to adopt this definition for purposes\nof section 3022 of the PHSA (that is, for purposes of information blocking) when defining\n“health care provider” in § 171.102. We noted that the PHSA definition is different from the\ndefinition of “health care provider” under the HIPAA Rules. We further stated that we were\nconsidering adjusting the information blocking definition of “health care provider” to cover all\nindividuals and entities covered by the HIPAA Rules “health care provider” definition in 45\nCFR 160.103. We sought comment on whether such an approach would be justified, and\nencouraged commenters to specify reasons why doing so might be necessary to ensure that the\ninformation blocking provision applies to all health care providers that might engage in\ninformation blocking.\n\n*Comments.* A significant number of commenters were in favor of using the definition\nof health care provider used in the HIPAA Rules. However, other commenters asserted that\ndoing so would exceed the scope intended by the Cures Act. Some commenters requested\nexclusions or a “phased-in” approach for the requirements for State agencies, institutions,\npublic health departments, ambulatory surgical centers, and other small providers due to their\nlimited resources or limited access to health IT. Other commenters suggested limiting the\napplication of the information blocking provisions only to those health care providers using\ncertified health IT though some commenters also opposed such a limitation. Some\ncommenters suggested including additional categories such as medical device manufacturers\nand community-based organizations that address social determinants of health (e.g., access to\nfood, housing, and transportation).\n\n*Response.* We have retained in this final rule the definition of “health care provider” as\nset forth in section 3000(3) of the PHSA as proposed. The definitions listed in section 3000 of\n\n\n\n\nthe PHSA apply “[i]n this title,” which refers to Title XXX of the PHSA. Section 3022 of the\nPHSA is included in Title XXX. We note that the last clause of the health care provider\ndefinition in section 3000(3) of the PHSA gives the Secretary discretion to expand the\ndefinition to any other category determined to be appropriate by the Secretary. We will\nconsider whether the definition should be expanded in the future if the scope of health care\nproviders subject to the information blocking provision does not appear to be broad enough in\npractice to ensure that the information blocking provision applies to all health care providers\nthat might engage in information blocking.\n\nWith respect to the requested exclusions or a “phased-in” approach for certain types of\nentities, we do not believe that this is necessary due to the addition of paragraph (b) within the\ninformation blocking definition in § 171.103 and the new Content and Manner Exception in §\n171.310. Section 171.103(b) states that until May 2, 2022—which is 18 months after the\ncompliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule (part 171)—EHI for\npurposes of part 171 is limited to the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the\nUnited States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard adopted in § 170.213 (see the\ndiscussion in section VIII.C). Similarly, the Content and Manner Exception allows actors to\nmake available a limited set of EHI (the USCDI) during the first 18 months after the six-\nmonth delayed compliance date for part 171 (a total of 24 months after publication of this final\nrule). This approach, as well as the Infeasibility Exception, will address concerns about certain\nactors having limited resources or limited access to health IT.\n\nThe health care provider definition and resources we have made available provide\nclarity and examples of the types of individuals and entities covered by the definition. To this\npoint, medical device manufacturers and community-based organizations, as described by\ncommenters, generally would not meet the health care provider definition unless they are also\n\n\n\n\na type of individual or entity identified in the definition.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "Section 3022(a)(1)(B) of the PHSA defines information blocking, in part, by reference\nto the conduct of health information technology developers. In the Proposed Rule (84 FR\n7510), we explained that, because title XXX of the PHSA does not define “health information\ntechnology developer,” we interpreted section 3022(a)(1)(B) in light of the specific authority\nprovided to OIG in section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). We noted that section 3022(b)(2)\ndiscusses developers, networks, and exchanges by referencing any individual or entity\ndescribed in section 3022(b)(1)(A) or (C). Section 3022(b)(1)(A) states, in relevant part, that\nOIG may investigate any claim that a health information technology developer of certified\nhealth information technology or other entity offering certified health information technology\nengaged in information blocking.\n\nWe believe it is reasonable to interpret these sections together to mean that the\ninformation blocking provision extends to individuals or entities that develop or offer certified\nhealth IT. That the individual or entity must develop or offer certified health IT, we explained,\nis further supported by section 3022(a)(7) of the PHSA—which refers to developers’\nresponsibilities to meet the requirements of certification—and section 4002 of the Cures\nAct—which identifies information blocking as a Condition of Certification. Consistent with\nthis, we proposed a definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” in § 171.102 (84\nFR 7601) and an interpretation of the use of “health information technology developer” in\nsection 3022 of the PHSA that would apply to part 171 only, and would not apply (84 FR\n7511) to the implementation of any other section of the PHSA122\nor the Cures Act, such as\n122\nBecause part 171 is referenced by part 170 subpart D, the definition and interpretation are relevant to developers’\n\n\n\n\nsection 4005(c)(1) of the Cures Act.\n\nLimiting the definition of health IT developer to developers of certified health IT\nComments. A number of commenters suggested broadening the definition of “health\nIT developers” to include all developers of health IT, whether or not any of their products\ninclude Health IT Module(s) certified under ONC’s Health IT Certification Program. Several\nof these commenters expressed concern that developers of only non-certified health IT would,\nunder our proposed definition, be able to continue to block patients from accessing or\ndirecting their EHI to third parties of their choice. A majority of these commenters expressed\nconcerns that an information blocking prohibition limited to developers who participate in the\nONC Health IT Certification Program (also referred to as “the Program”) will result in an\nuneven playing field for developers who participate in the Program in comparison to those\nwho do not participate in the Program. Some commenters suggested that this could motivate\ndevelopers to avoid or withdraw from the Program.\n\n*Response.* We believe that “health information technology developer” as used in\nPHSA section 3022(a)(1)(B) should be interpreted in light of the specific authority provided to\nOIG in section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). Section (b)(1)(A) states, in relevant part, that OIG\nmay investigate any claim that a health information technology developer of certified health\ninformation technology or other entity offering certified health information technology\nengaged in information blocking. We recognize that health IT developers that are not\ndevelopers of certified health IT could engage in conduct meeting the definition of\ninformation blocking in section 3022(a) of the PHSA. However, the statute places health IT\ndevelopers of certified health IT on different footing than other developers of health IT with\nobligations to meet Condition and Maintenance of Certification Requirements.\n\n\n\n\nrespect to information blocking enforcement. A broader definition of “health IT developer” in\n§ 171.102 would not change the scope or effect of section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) of the\nPHSA.\n\nWe acknowledge that the information blocking provision may change some health IT\ndevelopers’ assessments of whether participation in the voluntary ONC Health IT\nCertification Program is the right decision for their health IT products and customers.\n\nHowever, we believe the value certification offers to the health IT developers’ customers,\nsuch as health care providers, is substantially enhanced by both the information blocking\nprovision and the enhancements to certification called for in PHSA section 3001(c)(5)(D). We\nbelieve the benefit that certification offers health IT developers’ customers will continue to\nweigh in favor of the developers obtaining and maintaining certification of their products. For\nexample, the Promoting Interoperability Programs (formerly known as the Medicare and\nMedicaid EHR Incentive Programs) continue to require use of Certified EHR Technology\n(CERHT), which makes certification important for developers seeking to market certain types\nof health IT (notably including, but not limited to, that within the “Base EHR” definition in §\n170.102) to eligible clinicians, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended alternative approaches to interpreting\nthe Cures Act, to justify broadening the definition of “health IT developer” in 45 CFR 171.102\nto include all developers of any products within the definition of “health information\ntechnology” in section 3000 of the PHSA. These commenters offered a variety of rationales,\nincluding consideration of information that would have been available to Congress at the time\nthe Cures Act was enacted, as the basis for inferring that Congress did not intend to limit the\nscope of the information blocking provision to developers that participate in the voluntary\nONC Health IT Certification Program. Some commenters stated the phrasing of the Cures\n\n\n\n\nAct’s information blocking provision appeared to exclude health IT developers that do not\nparticipate in our Program and recommended that we address what some comments described\nas a potential enforcement gap by broadening the regulatory definition of “health IT\ndeveloper” in 45 CFR 171.102, although they did not identify a specific statutory basis for\nclosing what their comments described as a gap or drafting issue in the statute. One\ncommenter asked that we work with Congress to expand the definition of health IT developer\nbeyond those with at least one product that is or that includes at least one Health IT Module\ncertified under the Program.\n\n*Response.* As explained in the Proposed Rule and in the immediately preceding\nresponse to comments, we believe that “health information technology developer” as used in\nPHSA section 3022(a)(1)(B) should be interpreted in light of the specific authority provided to\nOIG in section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). Our interpretation is that the individual or entity\nmust develop or offer certified health IT to be considered a health IT developer covered by\nthe information blocking provision, which is further supported by PHSA sections 3022(a)(7)\nand 3001(c)(5)(D). Section 3022(a)(7) refers to developers’ responsibilities to meet the\nrequirements of certification, and section 3001(c)(5)(D) identifies as a Condition of\nCertification that a health IT developer not engage in information blocking. Moreover, PHSA\n§ 3022 does not specifically address all of the types of individuals and entities (such as health\nplans and claims data clearinghouses) that could or currently do engage in practices that might\notherwise meet the definition of information blocking in PHSA § 3022(a).\n\nApplicability of information blocking provision to non-certified health IT products of a\ndeveloper of certified health IT\nComments. On the whole, the majority of comments supported defining “health IT\ndeveloper” in a manner that includes all health IT products developed or offered by developers\n\n\n\n\nwho have at least one Health IT Module certified under the Program. However, multiple\ncomments, predominantly from the perspective of developers of certified health IT,\nrecommended that we limit the definition of “health IT developers of certified health IT” in §\n171.102 so that it would encompass only the developers’ conduct specific to their certified\nhealth IT products. Commenters advocating this more limited definition stated that these\ndevelopers’ non-certified health IT products would be competing against similar products of\ndevelopers who are not subject to the information blocking provision.\n\n*Response.* The Cures Act does not prescribe that only practices involving certified\nhealth IT may implicate PHSA section 3022(a). If Congress had intended to limit the\napplication of section 3022 of the PHSA to practices involving certified health IT, we believe\nPHSA section 3022 would have included language that tied enforcement of that section to the\noperation or performance of health IT products that include one or more Health IT Module(s)\ncertified under the Program. Instead, PHSA section 3022(b)(1)(A) provides that the HHS\nInspector General may investigate under PHSA section 3022 any claim that “a health\ninformation technology developer of certified health information technology or other entity\noffering certified health information technology—submitted a false attestation under section\n3001(c)(5)(D)(vii); or engaged in information blocking.” Similarly, neither subparagraph (B)\nof PHSA section 3022(b)(1), specific to claims that a health care provider engaged in\ninformation blocking, nor subparagraph (C), specific to claims that health information\nexchanges (HIEs) or health information networks (HINs) engaged in information blocking,\nincludes language limiting the Inspector General to investigating claims tied to these actors’\nuse of certified health IT.\n\nMoreover, our observation is that the customers of health IT developers of certified\nhealth IT seldom, if ever, rely solely on Health IT Modules certified under the Program to\n\n\n\n\nmeet their needs to access, exchange, and use EHI. A developer’s health IT product suite that\na hospital, clinician office practice, or other health care provider uses (and colloquially\nreferences) as its “EHR system” will typically include a wide variety of functions, services,\ncomponents, and combinations thereof. Even where such a health IT product suite meets the\ndefinition of “Certified EHR Technology” for purposes of participation in the Promoting\nInteroperability Programs, there is no guarantee that every part of the overall product suite will\nmeet the requirements of at least one certification criterion adopted by the Secretary. In fact,\ntypically only a subset of the functions, services, components, and combinations thereof\nwithin the overall product suite will meet the requirements of at least one certification\ncriterion adopted by the Secretary and be Health IT Modules certified under the Program.\n\nIf we were to interpret the information blocking provision as applying only to the\ncertified Health IT Modules within a developer’s product suite(s), we are concerned the\ndevelopers’ customers might too easily presume, based on the developer’s participation in the\nONC Health IT Certification Program, that the developer will not engage in information\nblocking with respect to any of the EHI that the customer uses of the developer’s product\nsuite(s) to access, exchange, or use. Moreover, limiting our definition of “health IT developer\nof certified health IT” for purposes of part 171 to only the subset of an individual or entity’s\nproducts that are, or that specifically include, Health IT Modules certified under our Program\ncould encourage developers to split various functions, services, or combinations thereof into\nmultiple products so that they could more easily or broadly avoid accountability for engaging\nin practices otherwise meeting the definition of information blocking in § 171.103 with\nrespect to various pieces of their product suite(s) rather than composing products in response\nto customers’ needs and preferences.\n\nWe do not believe this outcome would be in the best interest of patients, health care\n\n\n\n\nproviders, or other customers of health IT developers of certified health IT. Thus, while\nacknowledging that our definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” in specific\nmay, like the information blocking provision in general, change some health IT developers’\nassessments of whether participation in the voluntary ONC Health IT Certification Program is\nthe right decision for their health IT products and customers, we believe the definition we\nhave finalized offers necessary assurance to purchasers and users that a health IT developer\nthat has chosen to participate in the Program can be held accountable under part 170 subpart D\nand under part 171 should that developer also engage in any conduct meeting the definition of\ninformation blocking in § 171.103.\n\nDuration of health IT developer of certified health IT status\nWe proposed that “health IT developer of certified health IT” would mean an\nindividual or entity that develops or offers health information technology (as that term is\ndefined in 42 U.S.C. 300jj(5)) and which had, at the time it engaged in a practice that is the\nsubject of an information blocking claim, health information technology (one or more)\ncertified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program. We proposed (84 FR 7511) that the\nterm “information blocking claim” within this definition should be read broadly to encompass\nany statement of information blocking or potential information blocking. We also noted in the\nProposed Rule that “claims” of information blocking within this definition would not be\nlimited, in any way, to a specific form, format, or submission approach or process.\n\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that we were also considering additional approaches to\nhelp ensure developers and offerors of certified health IT remain subject to the information\nblocking provision for an appropriate period of time after leaving the Program. While\nencouraging commenters to identify alternative approaches for identifying when a developer\nor offeror should, and when they should no longer, be subject to the information blocking\n\n\n\n\nprovision, we requested comment on whether one of two specific approaches would best\nachieve our policy goal of ensuring that health IT developers of certified health IT will face\nconsequences under the information blocking provision if they engage in information blocking\nin connection with EHI that was stored or controlled by the developer or offeror while they\nwere participating in the Program. One such approach would have defined “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” as including developers and offerors of certified health IT\nthat continue to store EHI that was previously stored in health IT certified in the Program. The\nother would have continued to define a developer or offeror of health IT as a “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” for purposes of part 171 for an appropriate period of time,\nsuch as one year, after the developer or offeror left the Program (no longer had any Health IT\nModules certified under part 170).\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments in support of defining “health IT developer\nof certified health IT” in a way that would include developers and offerors who have left the\nProgram so long as they continue to store or control EHI that had been stored in or by their\nhealth IT products while the products were, or included one or more, Health IT Module(s)\ncertified in the Program. We also received several comments recommending developers of\ncertified health IT remain subject to the information blocking provision for a period of time\nafter leaving the Program. A couple of commenters recommended a hybrid approach that\nwould include individuals and entities in the definition of “health IT developer of certified\nhealth IT” while they continue to store EHI that had been stored in certified health IT or for a\nreasonable period of time after they ceased participating in the Program, whichever is longer.\n\nOne reason commenters stated in support of extending the definition of “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” beyond the time a developer ceased participating in the\nprogram was that in commenters’ view this could help former customers access the EHI that\n\n\n\n\nthe customers need to provide the best care for patients and that they had contracted with a\ndeveloper to manage while the developer had certified health IT. Some commenters stated that\nthe need for customers to ensure their contracts with Program-participating developers include\nprovisions for retrieval of the EHI upon termination or conclusion of the contract would be\neliminated if the period of time during which the “health IT developer of certified health IT”\ndefinition applied extended beyond the date a developer leaves the Program. Other comments\nrecommended against developers remaining subject to the information blocking provision\nafter leaving the Program, citing concerns such as burden.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their feedback. We have finalized in § 171.102\nthat a “health IT developer of certified health IT” for purposes of part 171 means an individual\nor entity, other than a health care provider that self-develops health IT for its own use, that\ndevelops or offers health information technology (as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C.\n\n300jj(5)) and which has, at the time it engages in a practice that is the subject of an\ninformation blocking claim, one or more Health IT Modules certified under a program for the\nvoluntary certification of health information technology that is kept or recognized by the\nNational Coordinator pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11(c)(5) (ONC Health IT Certification\nProgram). This definition will ensure conduct a developer or offeror engages in while it has\nany health IT product certified under the Program will be within the definition of “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” for purposes of part 171.\n\nWe have not extended the definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT”\nbeyond the date on which a developer or offeror no longer has any health IT certified under\nthe Program. It may be that extending duration of “health IT developer of certified health IT”\nstatus beyond the date on which a developer or offeror stops participating in the Program\ncould help motivate such a developer or offeror to better support transfers of EHI in their\n\n\n\n\ncustody if their customers choose to switch products because of the developer’s withdrawal\nfrom the Program. However, we believe that ensuring continuity of access to patients’ EHI is\nan essential consideration in the process of selecting and contracting for health IT. All\ntransitions between different health IT products will require transfer of EHI between those\nproducts. Planning for this transfer is, as a practical matter, integral to a successful transition\nbetween products that ensures continuity of access to EHI essential to safe, well-coordinated\npatient care. We are not persuaded that any of the alternative approaches to duration of “health\nIT developers of certified health IT” status could eliminate the need for health care providers\nand other customers of “health IT developers of certified health IT” to ensure their health IT\nplanning and contracting provides for appropriate transfer(s) of data at the conclusion or\ntermination of any particular contract.\n\nWe also note that in the market for certified Health IT Modules today, many of the\ncustomers of health IT developers or offerors are HIPAA-covered entities (such as health care\nproviders) or HIPAA business associates (BAs) (such as health information exchanges or\nclinical data registries) with whom covered entities contract for particular services. In such\ncases, the HIPAA Rules generally require that a HIPAA covered entity (or BA) enter into a\nbusiness associate agreement (BAA) that requires that the BA (or subcontractor BA) return or\ndestroy the PHI after the termination of its service as a BA (or subcontractor BA). Because a\ncontract for health IT products or services, and any associated BAA, could extend beyond a\ndeveloper or offeror’s departure from the ONC Health IT Certification Program, we believe\nsuch contracts and agreements provide an appropriate mechanism for customers to guard\nagainst a health IT developer or offeror who has left the Program refusing to relinquish EHI.\n\nWe note further that limiting the definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” to\nthe time period during which the individual or entity has at least one Health IT Module\n\n\n\n\ncertified under the Program would not require claims of information blocking to come to our\nattention during that same period. We have finalized the definition as proposed, with\nmodification to its wording that is discussed below.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter suggested that the definition of “information blocking\nclaim” should not include any “potential information blocking,” but instead should be\nevaluated with facts and evidence necessary to support a verifiable claim.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose to define in regulation “information blocking claim.”\n\nWe did note in the preamble to the Proposed Rule that for purposes of the definition of “health\nIT developer of certified health IT” proposed in § 171.102, claims of information blocking\nwould not be limited, in any way, to a specific form, format, or submission process (84 FR\n7511). In the definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” finalized in § 171.102,\nwe have retained reference to the time at which the individual or entity that develops or offers\ncertified health IT engages in a practice that is the subject of an information blocking claim so\nthat it is immediately clear on the face of the regulation text that the claim need not be brought\nwhile the developer still has certified health IT. If a health IT developer of certified health IT\nengages in a practice that is within the definition of information blocking in § 171.103 while\nthey remain in the Program, that health IT developer cannot avoid applicability of the\ninformation blocking provision to those practices by simply leaving the Program before any\nclaim(s) about the practice may come to light. Our reference to claims of information blocking\nin the finalized definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” is not intended to\nimply that any actor whose conduct is the subject of a claim of information blocking that is\nreceived by HHS necessarily will be found to have engaged in conduct meeting the definition\nof information blocking in § 171.103 or that is otherwise contrary to requirements of the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program (such as the Condition and Maintenance of Certification\n\n\n\n\nrequirements established in subpart D of part 170).123\nIf subject to an investigation, each\npractice that implicates the information blocking provision and does not meet an exception\nwould be analyzed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate, for example, whether it rises to the\nlevel of an interference, and whether the actor acted with the requisite intent.\n\nDevelopers and offerors of certified health IT\nWe stated in the proposed rule that within the definition of “health IT developer of\ncertified health IT” for purposes of part 171, we interpret an “individual or entity that develops\nthe certified health IT” as the individual or entity that is legally responsible for the\ncertification status of the health IT, which would be the individual or entity that entered into a\nbinding agreement that resulted in the certification status of the health IT under the Program\nor, if such rights are transferred, the individual or entity that holds the rights to the certified\nhealth IT (84 FR 7511). We also stated that an “individual or entity that offers certified health\nIT” would include an individual or entity that under any arrangement makes certified health IT\navailable for purchase or license. We requested comment on both of these interpretations, and\nwhether there are particular types of arrangements under which certified health IT is “offered”\nin which the offeror should not be considered a “health IT developer of certified health IT” for\nthe purposes of the information blocking provision.\n\n*Comments.* Several comments questioned the inclusion of offerors of certified health\nIT who do not themselves develop the health IT in the definition of “health IT developer of\ncertified health IT.” Some commenters recommended the exclusion of offerors who do not\nmodify or configure the health IT in question. Some commenters advocated treating entities\n123\nSection 3022(b) of the PHSA authorizes the HHS Office of the Inspector General to investigate claims of\ninformation blocking. Simultaneously, ONC has responsibility for assessing developers’ compliance with\nrequirements of the ONC Health IT Certification Program. Coordination between ONC and OIG in our respective\nroles is discussed in section VII.D.3 of this preamble.\n\n\n\n\nthat include other developers’ certified health IT in the health IT products or services they\noffer, but do not themselves develop certified health IT, as being outside the definition of\n“health IT developer of certified health IT.” Commenters stated that these offerors do not\nthemselves develop the certified health IT and thus do not control its design. Commenters also\nstated that the products offered by some of these offerors (such as clinical data registries\nwhich may be certified to clinical quality measurement and measure reporting criteria) are not\nprimary sources of patients’ EHI, and that offerors of health IT that is not a primary source of\nEHI should be excluded from the definition of health IT developer of certified health IT. One\ncommenter specifically recommended excluding from the definition individuals and entities\nthat offer under their own brand, but do not modify or configure, certified health IT developed\nby others. These commenters suggested that this is desirable in order to hold developers\naccountable for information blocking conduct in the course of development.\n\n*Response.* Including both developers and other offerors in the definition of “health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT” is consistent with the policy goal of holding all entities who\ncould, as a developer or offeror, engage in information blocking accountable for their practices\nthat are within the definition of information blocking in § 171.103. PHSA section\n3022(b)(1)(A) expressly references both “a health information technology developer of\ncertified health information technology” and “other entity offering certified health information\ntechnology” in the context of authority to investigate claims of information blocking. As\nstated in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7510), we interpret PHSA section 3022(a)(1)(B) in light of\nthe specific authority provided to OIG in PHSA section 3022(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2).\n\nWe interpret these sections together as the basis for applicability of the information\nblocking provision to individuals or entities that develop or offer certified health IT. We refer\ncommenters concerned about holding offerors that do not develop, modify, or configure health\n\n\n\n\nIT accountable for the conduct of others to PHSA section 3022(a)(6), which states that the\nterm “information blocking,” with respect to an individual or entity, shall not include an act or\npractice other than an act or practice committed by such individual or entity. Where the\nindividual or entity that develops health IT is different from the individual or entity that offers\ncertified health IT, each such individual or entity would have the potential to engage in\nvarious practices within the definition of information blocking in PHSA section 3022(a) and\n45 CFR 171.103, and we believe each should be accountable for their own conduct. Actors\nwho are not primary generators of EHI or who may hold only a few data classes or elements\nfor any given patient (as would be the case for examples specifically cited by commenters),\ncould nevertheless engage in conduct that constitutes information blocking as defined in §\n171.103 with respect to that EHI they do hold or control. We therefore see no reason to\nexclude them from the definition of health IT developer of certified health IT. To do so would\nnot be consistent with the policy goal of addressing the problem of information blocking.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that public health agencies that develop\nand/or offer health IT products and services, such as those related to syndromic surveillance\nand immunization registries, be excluded from the definition of health IT developer in §\n171.102.\n\n*Response.* We believe the vast majority of public health agencies would remain outside\nof our definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” finalized in § 171.102. The\n“public health” certification criteria within the ONC Health IT Certification Program are\napplicable to the health IT that health care providers would use to exchange information with\npublic health information infrastructure. These criteria are not applicable to the public health\ninformation reporting or exchange infrastructure itself.\n\nTreatment of “self-developers” of certified health IT\n\n\n\n\nWe stated in the proposed rule (84 FR 7511) that a “self-developer” of certified health\nIT, as the term has been used in the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program) and\ndescribed in section VII.D.7 of the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7507), section VII.D.7 of this\npreamble, and previous rulemaking,124\nwould be treated as a health care provider for the\npurposes of information blocking because our description of a self-developer for Program\npurposes125\nwould mean that they would not be supplying or offering their certified health IT\nto other entities (84 FR 7511 and 7512). We stated in the Proposed Rule that self-developers\nwould still be subject to the proposed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements because they have health IT certified under the Program (see also section\nVII.D.7 of the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7507) and section VII.D.7 of this preamble). We\nrequested comments on our treatment of “self-developers” for information blocking purposes\nand whether there are other factors we should consider.\n\n*Comments.* A number of comments expressed support of treating “self-developer”\nhealth care providers who do not supply or offer their certified health IT to other entities as\nhealth care providers for purposes of information blocking.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ input. The definition of “health IT developer of\ncertified health IT” that we have finalized in § 171.102 expressly excludes health care\nproviders who self-develop health IT for their own use. However, we remind health care\nproviders who may be considering or are embarking on self-development of certified Health\nIT Modules that “self-developers” are subject to certain Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements finalized in subpart D of part 170. These requirements include,\n124\nThe final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program, “Establishment of the Permanent\nCertification for Health Information” (76 FR 1261), addresses self-developers.\n\n125\nThe language in the final rule establishing ONC’s Permanent Certification Program describes the concept of\n“self-developed” as referring to a complete EHR or EHR Module designed, created, or modified by an entity that\nassumed the total costs for testing and certification and that will be the primary user of the health IT (76 FR 1300).\n\n\n\n\nthough they are not limited to, providing assurances and attestations that they will not, have\nnot, and do not engage in conduct constituting information blocking.\n\nFor purposes of the definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT,” we\ninterpret “a health care provider that self-develops health IT for its own use” to mean that the\nhealth care provider is responsible for the certification status of the Health IT Module(s) and is\nthe primary user of the Health IT Module(s). Moreover, we interpret “a health care provider\nthat self-develops health IT for its own use” to mean that the health care provider does not\noffer the health IT to other entities on a commercial basis or otherwise. This interpretation\nrests on our established concept of “self-developed” certified Health IT Modules. In this\ncontext, it is important to note that some use of a self-developer’s health IT may be made\naccessible to individuals or entities other than the self-developer and its employees without\nthat availability being interpreted as offering or supplying the health IT to other entities in a\nmanner inconsistent with the concept of “self-developer.” For example, if a hospital were to\nself-develop an EHR system, we would not consider inclusion in that system of certain\nfunctionalities or features—such as APIs or patient portals— to be offering or supplying the\nhospital’s self-developed health IT to other entities. We would also not interpret as offering or\nsupplying the self-developed health IT to other entities the issuance of login credentials\nallowing licensed health care professionals who are in independent practice to use the\nhospital’s EHR to furnish and document care to patients in the hospital. Keeping in the\nhospital’s EHR a comprehensive record of a patient’s care during an admission is a practice\nwe view as reasonable and it typically requires that all the professionals who furnish care to\npatients in the hospital be able to use the hospital’s EHR system. It is also customary practice\namongst hospitals that purchase commercially marketed health IT, as well as those that self-\ndevelop their health IT, to enable health care professionals in independent practice who\n\n\n\n\nfurnish care in the hospital to use the EHR in connection to furnishing and documenting that\ncare. Clinician portals made available to facilitate independent licensed health care\nprofessionals furnishing and/or documenting care to patients in the hospital would also not be\ninterpreted as negating the hospital’s “self-developer” status. However, if a health care\nprovider responsible for the certification status of any Health IT Module(s) were to offer or\nsupply those Health IT Module(s), separately or integrated into a larger product or software\nsuite, to other entities for those entities’ use in their own independent operations, that would\nbe inconsistent with the concept of the health care provider self-developing health IT for its\nown use.\n\nIn deciding to exclude health care providers who self-develop health IT for their own\nuse from the definition of “health IT developer of certified health IT” finalized in § 171.102,\nwe rely substantially on our Program experience that self-developed certified health IT\ncurrently represents a small, and diminishing, share of the Health IT Modules certified under\nour Program. We also note that we may consider amending this definition in future\nrulemaking in response to changing market conditions. For example, the market might evolve\nin ways that would increase risk of abuse of this exclusion of health care providers who self-\ndevelop certified health IT from the application of the § 171.103 definition of “information\nblocking” to their conduct as a developer of health IT. In such circumstances, we might\ncontemplate appropriate revisions to the definition of “health IT developer of certified health\nIT” for purposes of part 171.\n\nSummary of finalized policy: definition of health IT developer of certified health IT\nIn § 171.102, we have finalized that “health IT developer of certified health IT” means\nan individual or entity, other than a health care provider that self-develops health IT for its\nown use, that develops or offers health information technology (as that term is defined in 42\n\n\n\n\nU.S.C. 300jj(5)) and which has, at the time it engages in a practice that is the subject of an\ninformation blocking claim, one or more Health IT Modules certified under a program for the\nvoluntary certification of health information technology that is kept or recognized by the\nNational Coordinator pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11(c)(5) (ONC Health IT Certification\nProgram). This is substantially the definition we proposed (84 FR 7601), but with minor\nmodifications to its text.\n\nWe have added to this finalized definition “other than a health care provider that self-\ndevelops health IT for its own use,” so that this feature of the proposed definition which we\nstated in the Proposed Rule’s preamble (84 FR 7511) is immediately clear on the face of the\nregulation text itself. We also replaced the proposed phrasing “health information technology\n(one or more) certified” (84 FR 7601) with “one or more Health IT Modules certified”\nbecause it is more consistent with our Program terminology. We also replaced “under the\nONC Health IT Certification Program” from the proposed phrasing with the finalized “under a\nprogram for the voluntary certification of health information technology that is kept or\nrecognized by the National Coordinator pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300jj-11(c)(5) (ONC Health IT\nCertification Program).” Currently, we keep a single Program that we refer to as the ONC\nHealth IT Certification Program. For purposes of precision, we decided to refer to the\nstatutory basis for the Program, and indicate parenthetically the manner in which we currently\nreference it.\n\nWe interpret “individual or entity that develops” certified health IT as the individual or\nentity that is legally responsible for the certification status of the health IT, which would be\nthe individual or entity that entered into a binding agreement that resulted in the certification\nstatus of the health IT under the Program or, if such rights are transferred, the individual or\nentity that holds the rights to the certified health IT. As we clarified in the final rule “ONC\n\n\n\n\nHealth IT Certification Program: Enhanced Oversight and Accountability” (81 FR 72404), the\nconsequences under 45 CFR part 170 for a developer’s having had one or more of its\nproducts’ certification terminated apply to developers, their subsidiaries, and their successors\n(81 FR 72443).\n\nFor purposes of part 171 and the information blocking provision, we interpret an entity\nthat has health IT to include not only the entity that entered into a binding agreement that resulted\nin the certification status of the health IT under the Program, but also its subsidiaries, and its\nsuccessors. The facts and circumstances of a particular case may determine which individual(s) or\nentity (or entities) are culpable and whether enforcement against particular individual(s), the\ndeveloper entity, a successor in rights to the health IT, the developer or successor’s subsidiary, or\na parent entity will be pursued. Similarly, use of the word “individual” in this context does not\nlimit responsibility for practices of an entity that develops or offers health IT to the particular\nnatural person(s) who may have signed binding agreement(s) that resulted in the certification\nstatus of the health IT under the Program. Depending on the nature of the organization, the person\nwho signs the binding agreement that results in the certification status may be different from the\nperson who determines the fees, the person who implements the health IT, and the person who\nsets the overall business strategy for the company. The facts and circumstances of each case may\ndetermine who the culpable individual or individual(s) are and whether enforcement against the\nentity or against specific individual(s) will be pursued.\n\nAs stated in the Proposed Rule, for purposes of this definition, a developer or offeror\nof a single certified health IT product that has had its certification suspended will still be\nconsidered to have certified health IT (84 FR 7511).\n\n\n",

              "text": "The terms “network” and “exchange” are not defined in the information blocking\n\n\n\n\nprovision or in any other relevant statutory provisions. We proposed to define these terms in a\nway that does not assume the application or use of certain technologies and is flexible enough\nto apply to the full range and diversity of exchanges and networks that exist today and that\nmay arise in the future.\n\nWe stated that in considering the most appropriate way to define these terms, we\nexamined how they are used throughout the Cures Act and the HITECH Act. Additionally, we\nconsidered dictionary and industry definitions of “network” and “exchange.” While the terms\nhave varied usage and meaning in different industry contexts, we noted that certain concepts\nare common and were incorporated into the proposed definitions.\n\nHealth Information Network\nWe proposed a functional definition of “health information network” (HIN) that\nfocused on the role of these actors in the health information ecosystem. We stated that the\ndefining attribute of a HIN is that it enables, facilitates, or controls the movement of\ninformation between or among different individuals or entities that are unaffiliated. Therefore,\nwe proposed that two parties are affiliated if one has the power to control the other, or if both\nparties are under the common control or ownership of a common owner. We noted that a\nsignificant implication of the definition is that a health care provider or other entity that\nenables, facilitates, or controls the movement of EHI within its own organization, or between\nor among its affiliated entities, is not a HIN in connection with that movement of information\nfor the purposes of the HIN definition.\n\nWe proposed that an actor could be considered a HIN if it performs any one or any\ncombination of the following activities. First, the actor would be a HIN if it were to determine,\noversee, administer, control, or substantially influence policies or agreements that define the\nbusiness, operational, technical, or other conditions or requirements that enable or facilitate\n\n\n\n\nthe access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or more unaffiliated individuals or\nentities. Second, an actor would be a HIN if it were to provide, manage, control, or\nsubstantially influence any technology or service that enables or facilitates the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI between or among two or more unaffiliated individuals or entities.\n\nWe noted that, typically, a HIN will influence the sharing of EHI between many\nunaffiliated individuals or entities. However, we did not propose to establish any minimum\nnumber of parties or “nodes” beyond the requirement that there be some actual or\ncontemplated access, exchange, or use of information between or among at least two\nunaffiliated individuals or entities that is enabled, facilitated, or controlled by the HIN. We\nstated that any further limitation would be artificial and would not capture the full range of\nentities that should be considered networks under the information blocking provision. We\nclarified that any individual or entity that enables, facilitates, or controls the access, exchange,\nor use of EHI between or among only itself and another unaffiliated individual or entity would\nnot be considered a HIN in connection with the movement of that EHI (although that\nmovement of EHI may still be regulated under the information blocking provision on the basis\nthat the individual or entity is a health care provider or health IT developer of certified health\nIT). To be a HIN, we emphasized that the individual or entity would need to be enabling,\nfacilitating, or controlling the access, exchange, or use of EHI between or among two or more\nother individuals or entities that were not affiliated with it.\n\nWe provided multiple examples to illustrate how the proposed definition would\noperate. An entity is established within a state for the purpose of improving the movement of\nEHI between the health care providers operating in that state. The entity identifies standards\nrelating to security and offers terms and conditions to be entered into by health care providers\nwishing to participate in the network. The entity offering (and then overseeing and\n\n\n\n\nadministering) the terms and conditions for participation in the network would be considered a\nHIN for the purpose of the information blocking provision. We noted that there is no need for\na separate entity to be created in order for that entity to be considered a HIN. To illustrate, we\nstated that a health system that “administers” business and operational agreements for\nfacilitating the exchange of EHI that are adhered to by unaffiliated family practices and\nspecialist clinicians in order to streamline referrals between those practices and specialists\nwould likely be considered a HIN.\n\nWe noted that the proposed definition would also encompass an individual or entity\nthat does not directly enable, facilitate, or control the movement of information, but\nnonetheless exercises control or substantial influence over the policies, technology, or\nservices of a network. In particular, we stated that there may be an individual or entity that\nrelies on another entity—such as an entity specifically created for the purpose of managing a\nnetwork—for policies and technology, but nevertheless dictates the movement of EHI over\nthat network. As an example, a large health care provider could decide to lead an effort to\nestablish a network that facilitates the movement of EHI between a group of smaller health\ncare providers (as well as the large health care provider) and through the technology of health\nIT developers. To achieve this outcome, the large health care provider, together with some of\nthe participants, could create a new entity that administers the network’s policies and\ntechnology.\n\nIn this scenario, we noted that the large health care provider would come within the\nfunctional definition of a HIN and could be held accountable for the conduct of the network if\nthe large health care provider used its control or substantial influence over the new entity—\neither in a legal sense, such as via its control over the governance or management of the entity,\nor in a less formal sense, such as if the large health care provider prescribed a policy to be\n\n\n\n\nadopted—to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We clarified that the large\nhealth care provider in this example would be treated as a health care provider when utilizing\nthe network to move EHI via the network’s policies, technology, or services, but would be\nconsidered a HIN in connection with the practices of the network over which the large health\ncare provider exercises control or substantial influence.\n\nWe sought comment on the proposed definition of a HIN. In particular, we requested\ncomment on whether the proposed definition was broad enough (or too broad) to cover the full\nrange of individuals and entities that could be considered HINs within the meaning of the\ninformation blocking provision. Additionally, we specifically requested comment on whether\nthe proposed definition would effectuate our policy goal of defining this term in a way that\ndoes not assume particular technologies or arrangements and was flexible enough to\naccommodate changes in these and other conditions.\n\nWe note that we summarize and respond to the comments received on the HIN\ndefinition below with the comments received on the health information exchange definition\n(HIE) due to the overlap in the comments received and our responses.\n\nHealth Information Exchange\nWe proposed to define a “health information exchange” (HIE) as an individual or\nentity that enables access, exchange, or use of EHI primarily between or among a particular\nclass of individuals or entities or for a limited set of purposes. We noted that our research and\nexperience in working with exchanges drove the proposed definition of this term. We stated\nthat HIEs would include, but were not limited to, regional health information organizations\n(RHIOs), State health information exchanges (State HIEs), and other types of organizations,\nentities, or arrangements that enable EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used between or\namong particular types of parties or for particular purposes. As an example, we noted an HIE\n\n\n\n\nmight facilitate or enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI exclusively within a regional\narea (such as a RHIO), or for a limited scope of participants and purposes (such as a clinical\ndata registry or an exchange established by a hospital-physician organization to facilitate\nAdmission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) alerting). We further noted that HIEs may be\nestablished under Federal or State laws or regulations but may also be established for specific\nhealth care or business purposes or use cases. We also mentioned that if an HIE facilitates the\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI for more than a narrowly defined set of purposes, then it may\nbe both an HIE and a HIN.\n\nWe sought comment on the proposed HIE definition and encouraged commenters to\nconsider whether the proposed definition was broad enough (or too broad) to cover the full\nrange of individuals and entities that could be considered exchanges within the meaning of the\ninformation blocking provision, and whether the proposed definition was sufficiently flexible\nto accommodate changing technological and other conditions.\n\nComments on the HIN and HIE Definitions\nAs mentioned above, we received substantially similar comments on both proposed\ndefinitions. Based on those comments and our approach to the final definition for these terms,\nwe have combined our comment summary and response for the proposed definitions.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters suggested that the definitions of HIN and HIE should\nbe combined because confusion could arise in trying to distinguish between the two terms.\n\nCommenters asserted that these definitions are used to describe entities that perform the same\nor similar functions. Some commenters expressed support for the broad functional definitions\nof HIE and HIN, while others expressed concern that many organizations could be\nunintentionally covered by the proposed definitions due to the broad scope of the definitions\nas proposed.\n\n\n\n\nMany commenters suggested excluding certain individuals and entities from the HIE\nand/or HIN definitions, while other commenters noted such an approach could significantly\nlimit the application of the information blocking provision. Proposed exclusions offered by\ncommenters included, but were not limited to: health plans, payers, health care providers,\nbusiness associates, accountable care organizations, health care clearinghouses, public health\nagencies, research organizations, clinical data registries, certified health information\ntechnology providers, software developers, mobile app providers, cloud storage vendors,\ninternet service providers, and patient or consumer focused social media.\n\nSome commenters suggested limiting the types of activities and/or the purposes for\nthose activities that might be necessary to be considered a HIN or HIE.\n\nCommenters also raised concerns with particular language in the proposed HIN\ndefinition, noting that the term “substantially influences” was vague and that we should\nremove “individual” from the definitions as commenters could not foresee an individual acting\nas a HIN or HIE.\n\n*Response.* The definitions of HIN and HIE in the Proposed Rule achieved a key goal\nwhich was to solicit feedback from a wide array of stakeholders that might be considered\nHINs or HIEs under the proposed definition, including on whether the definitions were too\nbroad or not broad enough. We have adopted a modified definition in this final rule to address\nmuch of the feedback without expressly excluding any specific type of entity, which we\nbelieve would be unwieldy to appropriately administer and, more importantly, in conflict with\nour overarching approach to include any individual or entity that performs certain functional\nactivities as outlined in the Proposed Rule.\n\nForemost, in this final rule, we are combining the definitions of HIN and HIE to create\none functional definition that applies to both statutory terms in order to clarify the types of\n\n\n\n\nindividuals and entities that would be covered. This approach is consistent with statements we\nmade in the Proposed Rule noting that a HIE could also be an HIN. In addition, section 3022\nof the PHSA often groups these two terms together, and as we noted previously, does not\ndefine them. This approach will also eliminate stakeholder confusion as expressed by\ncommenters and respond to commenters who asserted the terms refer to entities performing\nthe same function. To this point, we have found numerous associations and publications\nreferring to entities that perform the same or similar functions that we have specified in the\nHIN/HIE definition as HINs, HIEs, and regional health information organizations (RHIOs).126\nWe have finalized under § 171.102 that a health information network or health information\nexchange means an individual or entity that determines, controls, or has the discretion to\nadminister any requirement, policy, or agreement that permits, enables, or requires the use of\nany technology or services for access, exchange, or use of EHI: (1) among more than two\nunaffiliated individuals or entities (other than the individual or entity to which this definition\nmight apply) that are enabled to exchange with each other; and (2) that is for a treatment,\npayment, or health care operations purpose, as such terms are defined in 45 CFR 164.501\nregardless of whether such individuals or entities are subject to the requirements of 45 CFR\nparts 160 and 164.\n\n126\nSee HIMSS FAQ, Health Information Exchange: A catch-all phrase for all health information exchange,\nincluding Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), Quality Information Organizations (QIOs), Agency\nfor Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-funded communities and private exchanges,\nhttps://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=7d5b6f82-210e6652-7d5b5ebd-0cc47a6a52de-\nfe4abdcde0e54deb&u=https://www.himss.org/library/health-information-exchange/FAQ; AHIMA, “An HIE is the\nelectronic movement of health-related information among organizations according to nationally recognized\nstandards. HIE is also sometimes referred to as a health information network (HIN)”,\nhttp://bok.ahima.org/PdfView?oid=104129; SHIEC Member List, SHIEC is the trade association of HIEs, called the\nStrategic Health Information Exchange collaborative, which has 17 members with “network” in their name,\nhttps://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=f84ddacd-a418d31d-f84debf2-0cc47a6a52de-\n8424832df6e921dc&u=https://strategichie.com/membership/member-list/.\n\n\n\n\nIn consideration of comments, we also narrowed the definition in three ways. First, the\ntypes of actions (e.g., manages or facilitates) that would be necessary for an actor to meet the\ndefinition of HIN or HIE were reduced. This includes removing the “substantially influences”\nelement of the proposed definition of HIN to address concerns about possible ambiguity.\n\nSecond, we have revised the definition to specify that to be a HIN or HIE there must be\nexchange among more than two unaffiliated individuals or entities besides the HIN/HIE that\nare enabled to exchange with each other. This revision ensures that the definition does not\nunintentionally cover what are essentially bilateral exchanges in which the intermediary is\nsimply performing a service on behalf of one entity in providing EHI to another or multiple\nentities and no actual exchange is taking place among all entities (e.g., acting as an\nintermediary between two entities where the first sends non-standardized data to be converted\nby the intermediary into standardized data for the receiving entity). To be clear, to be enabled,\nthe parties must have the ability and discretion to exchange with each other under the policies,\nagreements, technology, and/or services. Third, we focused the definition on three activities:\ntreatment, payment, and health care operations, as each are defined in the HIPAA Rules (45\nCFR § 164.501). The activities described by the terms treatment, payment and health care\noperations were selected for multiple reasons. Many, but not all, individuals and entities that\nwould meet the definition of HIN/HIE for information blocking purposes will be familiar with\nthese terms because they currently function as a covered entity or business associate under the\nHIPAA Rules. Last, this approach serves to ensure that certain unintended individuals and\nentities are not covered by the definition, which we discuss in more detail below.\n\nTwo important points about the definition require clarification. First, the reference to\nthe three types of activities does not limit the application of the HIN/HIE definition to\nindividuals or entities that are covered entities or business associates (as defined in HIPAA).\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if three unaffiliated entities exchanging information were health care providers\nthat were not HIPAA covered entities, their exchange of information for treatment purposes\nthrough a HIN or HIE would qualify for this element of the definition even though the\nHIN/HIE would not be a business associate to any of the providers. We expect such situations\nto be rare, but they may occur. Second, the three activities serve as elements of the definition\nsuch that if an individual or entity meets them, then the individual or entity would be\nconsidered a HIN/HIE under the information blocking regulations for any practice they\nconducted while functioning as a HIN/HIE. To illustrate, if a HIN/HIE was exchanging EHI\non behalf of a health care provider for treatment purposes, but denied an individual access to\ntheir EHI available in the HIN/HIE, then the HIN/HIE would be considered a HIN/HIE under\nthe circumstances for the purposes of information blocking. Having said this, the HIN/HIE\nmay not have “interfered with” the individual’s access to their EHI depending on the terms of\nthe HIN/HIE’s business associate agreements with the participating covered entities or for\nother reasons such as the EHI could not be disclosed by law or the HIN/HIE met an exception\nunder the information blocking provision. To be clear, the HIN/HIE definition is only\napplicable to the circumstances of an information blocking claim. For example, a health care\nprovider that may have ownership of a HIN/HIE, would not be considered a HIN/HIE, but\ninstead a “health care provider” with respect to situations that involve their behavior as a\nhealth care provider, such as denying another health care provider’s ability to access,\nexchange, or use EHI for treatment purposes or denying an individual’s access to their EHI via\nthe health care provider’s patient portal.\n\nWith respect to suggestions to exclude specific types of entities, we believe that the\nCures Act goals of supporting greater interoperability, access, exchange, and use of EHI are\nbest advanced by a functional definition without specific exclusions. We note, however, that\n\n\n\n\nthe narrower definition of HIN/HIE in this final rule should clearly exclude entities that might\nhave been included under the proposed definitions, such as social networks, internet service\nproviders, and technology that solely facilitates the exchange of information among patients\nand family members. The definition in this final rule continues to focus on the functional\nactivity of the individual or entity in question and not on any title or classification of the\nperson or entity.\n\nThe reference to “individual” was maintained in the final rule because the Cures Act\nstates that penalties apply to any individual or entity that is a developer, network, or exchange\n(see section 3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA).\n\n\n",

              "text": "In the Proposed Rule, we noted that the information blocking definition applies to\nelectronic health information (EHI) (section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA). We further noted that\nwhile section 3000(4) of the PHSA by reference to section 1171(4) of the Social Security Act\ndefines “health information,” EHI is not specifically defined in the Cures Act, PHSA,\nHITECH Act, or other relevant statutes. Therefore, we proposed to include the definition of\nEHI in § 171.102 and define it to mean (84 FR 7513):\n(i) electronic protected health information; and\n(ii) any other information that –\n is transmitted by or maintained in electronic media, as defined in 45 CFR\n160.103;\n identifies the individual, or with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to\nbelieve the information can be used to identify the individual; and\n relates to the past, present, or future health or condition of an individual; the\nprovision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment\n\n\n\n\nfor the provision of health care to an individual (84 FR 7513).\n\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that this definition of EHI includes, but is not\nlimited to: electronic protected health information and health information that is created or\nreceived by a health care provider and those operating on their behalf; health plan; health care\nclearinghouse; public health authority; employer; life insurer; school; or university. In\naddition, we clarified that under our proposed definition, EHI includes, but is not limited to,\nelectronic protected health information (ePHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103. We noted that\nEHI may also be provided, directly from an individual, or from technology that the individual\nhas elected to use, to an actor covered by the information blocking provisions. We also\nproposed that EHI does not include health information that is de-identified consistent with the\nrequirements of 45 CFR 164.514(b) (84 FR 7513).\n\nWe clarified that the EHI definition provides for an expansive set of health\ninformation, which could include information on an individual’s health insurance eligibility\nand benefits, billing for health care services, and payment information for services to be\nprovided or already provided, which may include price information (84 FR 7513).\n\nWe generally requested comment on this proposed definition as well as on whether the\nexclusion of health information that is de-identified consistent with the requirements of 45\nCFR 164.514(b). We also sought comment on the parameters and implications of including\nprice information within the scope of EHI for purposes of information blocking (84 FR 7513).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters were strongly supportive of the proposed EHI\ndefinition, stating that it covers the breadth of EHI that should be addressed within the\nregulation. Conversely, many other commenters, including health care providers and health IT\ndevelopers, contended that the definition was overly broad and vague. They expressed concern\nabout their ability to know what health information they must make available for access,\n\n\n\n\nexchange, and use for the purposes of complying with the information blocking provision.\n\nSome other commenters posited that they could be put in a situation of having to separate EHI\nfrom PHI for compliance purposes, noting this would be extremely burdensome. Many\ncommenters stated simply trying to determine what constitutes EHI for compliance purposes\nwould be extremely burdensome and costly.\n\nCommenters offered various options for narrowing the scope of the EHI definition.\n\nMany commenters suggested that EHI should only be electronic protected health information\n(ePHI) as defined under the HIPAA Rules. Some of these commenters specifically\nrecommended that the EHI definition be limited to align with the definition of a designated\nrecord set under HIPAA. A few commenters stated that EHI should be limited to\nobservational health information as described in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7516).\n\nCommenters also recommended that the EHI definition be limited to only standardized health\ninformation, with some commenters recommending that EHI be specifically limited to\ninformation that meets the USCDI standard.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments and agree that actors should not have to\nseparate ePHI from EHI in order to comply with both the HIPAA Rules and the information\nblocking provision. It is also important for actors to clearly understand what health\ninformation should be available for access, exchange, and use. To address these concerns, we\nhave focused the EHI definition at this time on terms that are used in the HIPAA Rules and\nthat are widely understood in the health care industry as well as on a set of health information\nthat is currently collected, maintained, and made available for access, exchange, and use by\nactors. By doing so, we believe we have eliminated any perceived burden and actors will be in\na situation that will permit them to readily and continually comply with the information\nblocking provision. While we understand that some commenters supported the EHI definition\n\n\n\n\nas proposed or included alternative definitions in their comments, we believe that, for the\nabove reasons, the EHI definition we have codified in regulation through this final rule will\nenable effective implementation.\n\nWe have defined EHI (§ 171.102) to mean electronic protected health information\n(ePHI) as the term is defined for HIPAA in 45 CFR 160.103 to the extent that the ePHI would\nbe included in a designated record set as defined in 45 CFR 164.501 (other than\npsychotherapy notes as defined in 45 CFR 164.501 or information compiled in reasonable\nanticipation of, or for use in, a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding),\nregardless of whether the group of records are used or maintained by or for a covered entity as\ndefined in 45 CFR 160.103. The ePHI definition in 45 CFR 160.103 incorporates the\ndefinitions in that section for protected health information and electronic media. Although the\ndefinition of designated record set refers to records maintained by or for a covered entity, the\nEHI definition has been finalized to apply to groups of records (as they are included in the\ndesignated record set) regardless of whether they are maintained by or for a covered entity\n(e.g., a developer of certified health IT, a health information network, a health information\nexchange, or even a health care provider that may not be a covered entity or may not be acting\nas a business associate of a covered entity).\n\nWe did not focus the EHI definition finalized in this final rule on observational health\ninformation (OHI) as described in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7516) for multiple reasons. We\ndid not and cannot not at this time define OHI concretely. The use of OHI as a definition\nwould also not align with our above stated goals to provide alignment with the HIPAA Rules\nand ease of implementation for actors. We also did not focus the EHI definition solely on the\ndata identified in the USCDI standard. We are strong supporters of interoperability and\nstandards-based access and exchange. To this point, the ONC Health IT Certification Program\n\n\n\n\n(Program) supports standards-based interoperability through the adoption of standards and the\ncertification of health IT to those standards. In this respect, we have made the USCDI a\nbaseline set of data that certified health IT must be able to make available for access and\nexchange (see section IV.B.1 of this preamble). However, this set of EHI is too limiting in\nterms of what actors are capable of making available in both the near and long term as is\nevident by compliance with HIPAA’s right of access regulatory provision in 45 CFR 164.524.\n\nTo be further responsive to commenters expressing compliance concerns about the\nEHI definition, we have established a new “Content and Manner” exception in this final rule\n(§ 171.301) that will provide actors time to adjust to the new information blocking paradigm\nand make EHI available for access, exchange, and use. The new exception permits an actor to\nprovide, at a minimum, a limited set of EHI comprised of the data elements included in the\nUSCDI for access, exchange, and use during the first 18 months after the compliance date of\nthe information blocking provisions (24 months after publication of this final rule). The data\nelements represented in the USCDI represent an even more focused set of data than the\nfinalized EHI definition (§ 171.102). We refer readers to section VIII.D.2.a of this final rule\nfor further discussion of this new exception.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters argued both for and against the inclusion of price information\nin the EHI definition. Commenters that argued for the inclusion of price information stated\nthat it was well within the meaning of the term health information found in the PHSA. Many\nof these commenters argued that the availability of this type of information would be helpful\nto patients in selecting and obtaining health care. Commenters also contended that the\navailability of price information would increase competition and reduce health care costs.\n\nConversely, other commenters made various arguments for not including price information\nwithin the definition of EHI. Some of these commenters asserted that price information was\n\n\n\n\nnot within the scope of health information as specified in section 3022 of the PHSA because\nCongress did not specifically include it. Commenters also asserted that price information is\ntoo vague and lacks standardization to be clearly understood and made available for access,\nexchange, and use. Other commenters contended that disclosing price information would\nviolate trade secret laws and would harm competitive pricing by health plans.\n\n*Response.* The EHI definition codified through this final rule does not expressly\ninclude or exclude price information. However, to the extent that ePHI includes price\ninformation and is included in a designated record set, it would be considered EHI. This\napproach is intended to assure that the current scope of EHI for purposes of information\nblocking is aligned with the definitions of ePHI and designated record set under the HIPAA\nRules, with limited exceptions.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters specifically questioned whether algorithms or\nprocesses that create EHI, or the clinical interpretation or relevancy of the results of the\nalgorithms or processes, would be considered EHI.\n\n*Response.* The EHI definition codified through this final rule does not expressly\ninclude or exclude algorithms or processes that create EHI, or the clinical interpretation or\nrelevancy of the results of the algorithms or processes. However, any such information would\nbe considered EHI if it was ePHI included in the designated record set (such as the inclusion\nof the clinical interpretation of an algorithm’s results in an individual’s clinical note). Like\nwith price information, this approach is intended to ensure that the current scope of EHI for\npurposes of information blocking is aligned with the definitions of ePHI and designated record\nset under the HIPAA Rules, with limited exception.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters supported the position that health information which is\nde-identified in accordance with HIPAA regulations should not be considered EHI.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We agree that health information that is de-identified consistent with the\nrequirements of 45 CFR 164.514(b) should not be included in EHI. It is not, however,\nnecessary to specifically exclude such de-identified information from the EHI definition\nbecause information that does not identify an individual, and with respect to which there is no\nreasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual, is not\nindividually identifiable information, so it would not be EHI (see 45 CFR 164.514(a)). To\nnote, once PHI has been de-identified, it is no longer considered to be PHI. So, such\ninformation would not be considered EHI by definition (see 45 CFR 164.514 (b)).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter viewed the proposed EHI definition as overly restrictive\nby requiring EHI to be individually identifiable.\n\n*Response.* The EHI definition codified through this final rule retains the core\nrequirement that the health information be individually identifiable in order to be consistent\nwith HIPAA and general health care industry practice regarding use and disclosure of health\ninformation.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "\n\n\n\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision promotes the\nability to access, exchange, and use EHI, consistent with the requirements of applicable law.\n\nWe interpreted the terms “access,” “exchange,” and “use” broadly, consistent with their\ngenerally understood meaning in the health IT industry and their function and context in the\ninformation blocking provision (84 FR 7514).\n\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the concepts of access, exchange, and use are\nclosely related: EHI cannot be used unless it can be accessed, and this often requires that the\nEHI be exchanged among different individuals or entities and through various technological\nmeans. Moreover, the technological and other means necessary to facilitate appropriate access\nand exchange of EHI vary significantly depending on the purpose for which the information\nwill be used. We stated that this explanation is consistent with the way these terms are\nemployed in the information blocking provision and in other relevant statutory provisions.\n\nNoting, for example, that section 3022(a)(2) of the PHSA contemplates a broad range of\npurposes for which EHI may be accessed, exchanged, and used—from treatment, care\ndelivery, and other permitted purposes, to exporting complete information sets and\ntransitioning between health IT systems, to supporting innovations and advancements in\nhealth information access, exchange, and use.\n\nIn addition, we stated in the Proposed Rule that we considered how the terms access,\nexchange, and use have been defined or used in existing regulations and other relevant health\nIT industry contexts. We explained that, while those definitions have specialized meanings\nand are not controlling for the purposes of information blocking, they are instructive insofar as\nthey illustrate the breadth with which these terms have been understood in other contexts. We\nnoted that the HIPAA Security Rule defines “access” as the ability or the means necessary to\nread, write, modify, or communicate data/information or otherwise use any system resource\n\n\n\n\n(45 CFR 164.304). Last, we noted that the HIPAA Privacy Rule defines the term “use,” which\nincludes the sharing, employment, application, utilization, examination, or analysis of\nindividually identifiable health information within an entity that maintains the information (45\nCFR 160.103).\n\nWe stated that the types of access, exchange, and use described above would be\npromoted under the information blocking provision, as would other types of access, exchange,\nor use not specifically contemplated in these or other regulations.\n\nWe emphasized in the Proposed Rule the interrelated nature of the definitions and\nproposed to define these terms in § 171.102. For example, the definition of “use” that we\nproposed includes the ability to read, write, modify, manipulate, or apply EHI to accomplish a\ndesired outcome or to achieve a desired purpose, while “access” is defined as the ability or\nmeans necessary to make EHI available for use. As such, we specified that the interference\nwith “access” would include, for example, an interference that prevented a health care\nprovider from writing EHI to its health IT or from modifying EHI stored in health IT, whether\nby the provider itself or by, or via, a third-party app. We encouraged comment on these\ndefinitions. In particular, we asked commenters to consider whether these definitions are\nbroad enough to cover all of the potential purposes for which EHI may be needed and ways in\nwhich it could conceivably be used, now and in the future.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters supported our proposed definitions of “access,”\n\n“exchange,” and “use,” based on our broad interpretation of the definitions, which they stated\nsupports interoperability. Several health IT developers and developer organizations stated that\nthe definition of “access” was overly broad. They suggested that we clarify and narrow the\nscope of our proposed definition of “access.” One commenter specifically suggested that we\nclarify that “access” need not be provided through a direct interface. Some commenters\n\n\n\n\nsuggested that we remove the proposed language regarding “any and all source systems.”\n\nSome commenters expressed concern that the proposed definition of “exchange” is\noverly broad. Other commenters requested additional clarity regarding the scope of the\ndefinition. One commenter suggested that we clarify the meaning of “transmission” within the\ndefinition.\n\nSome health care providers and provider organizations stated that our proposed\ndefinition of “use” was overly broad. Some commenters suggested that we look to more\nestablished definitions of “use,” such as HIPAA. Other commenters suggested that the\nproposed definition would inappropriately increase administrative burden.\n\n*Response.* We have revised these definitions in response to comments. These revisions\ndo not narrow the scope of the definitions in regard to their intended interpretation and\npurpose in supporting interoperability and the goals of the information blocking provision. We\nbelieve, however, the revisions and their explanations below will provide the necessary\nclarifications for stakeholders to properly implement and comply with the terms.\n\nAccess\nWe have finalized the definition of “access” as “the ability or means necessary to\nmake EHI available for exchange, use, or both” (§ 171.102). This final definition improves on\nthe proposed definition (see 84 FR 7601) in a couple of ways. First, it makes clear that\n“access” is the ability or means necessary to make EHI available not only for “use,” but also\nfor “exchange” or both (the proposed definition only included “for use”). This modification\nwill provide clarity because, as we noted in the Proposed Rule, these terms are interrelated and\nEHI cannot be exchanged or used if it is inaccessible. Second, to be responsive to comments\nand in order to promote additional clarity in the definition, we have removed “including the\nability to securely and efficiently locate and retrieve information from any and all source\n\n\n\n\nsystems in which the information may be recorded or maintained” from the definition. This\nlanguage was exemplary and resulted in some confusion among stakeholders. Last, we clarify\nthat the definition of “access” is not limited to direct interfaces, which we believe is evident by\nthe final definition.\n\nExchange\nWe have finalized the definition of “exchange” as “the ability for electronic health\ninformation to be transmitted between and among different technologies, systems, platforms,\nor networks.” As with the finalized “access” definition, we have maintained the general scope\nof the proposed definition while modifying the definition for clarity. First, we removed\n“securely and efficiently” as proposed descriptors of the way that EHI is to be transmitted\nunder the definition. While we continue to advocate for and promote secure and efficient\nexchange, we do not think this descriptive language is necessary within the definition of\n“exchange” because “exchange” for the purposes of the information blocking provision can\noccur regardless of whether the transaction is “secure” or “efficient.” Our intent with this\ndefinition was never to exclude unsecure or “inefficient” exchanges from the definition or\nenforcement of the information blocking provision because the exchange of EHI was not\nsecure or “inefficient,” so we have removed this extraneous language. We also refer\nstakeholders to the information blocking exceptions included in this final rule that discuss how\nEHI may be transmitted and the importance of security as it relates to the access, exchange,\nand use of EHI.\n\nSecond, we have removed the provision at the end of the proposed definition, that in\norder for “exchange” to occur, it must be “in a manner that allows the information to be\naccessed and used.” This language was potentially confusing because the manner of\ntransmittal is not a necessary component of the “exchange” definition. If EHI is exchanged but\n\n\n\n\nis done so in way that does not permit the use of the EHI, then that practice may implicate the\ninformation blocking provision because the “use” of the EHI is being prevented. Further, to be\nresponsive to comments, we emphasize that “transmitted” within the definition is not limited\nto a one-way transmission, but instead is inclusive of all forms of transmission such as bi-\ndirectional and network-based transmission. We note this as a point of clarification, as it was\nalways our intent that “transmission” would be interpreted this way.\n\nUse\nWe have finalized “use” to mean “the ability for EHI, once accessed or exchanged, to\nbe understood and acted upon.” Put another way, “use” is an individual or entity’s ability to do\nsomething with the EHI once it has been accessed or exchanged. We believe this final\ndefinition is more concise and clear than the proposed definition—“the ability of health IT or\na user of health IT to access relevant EHI; to comprehend the structure, content, and meaning\nof the information; and to read, write, modify, manipulate, or apply the information to\naccomplish a desired outcome or to achieve a desired purpose” (84 FR 7602). Again, we\nemphasize the general scope and meaning of the definition is the same as proposed as\nexplained below.\n\nFirst, we have removed language that is more appropriately used as examples in this\npreamble. For instance, the use of the word “understood” in the final definition encompasses\nthe ability to comprehend various things such the structure, content, and meaning of the\ninformation from the proposed definition. However, we clarify that “understood” just like the\nproposed term “comprehend” does not mean the ability to understand the clinical significance\nor relevance of the EHI. For example, if an ambulatory provider received patient EHI from a\nhospital that included a risk score, the concept of “use” does not require the hospital to provide\nadditional resources to interpret the score nor would the tool or technology needed to interpret\n\n\n\n\nthe information be considered an interoperability element because its sole purpose is clinical\ninterpretation.\n\nSimilarly to “understood,” “acted upon” within the final definition encompasses the\nability to read, write, modify, manipulate, or apply the information from the proposed\ndefinition. We also clarify that “use” is bi-directional (to note, we also clarified above in the\n“exchange” discussion that “exchange” is bi-directional). Thus, an actor’s practice could\nimplicate the information blocking provision not only if the actor’s practice interferes with the\nrequestor’s ability to read the EHI (one-way), but also if the actor’s practice interferes with the\nrequestor’s ability to write the EHI (bi-directional) back to a health IT system.\n\nWe note that the ability “to access relevant EHI” from the proposed definition will fall\nunder the “access” definition, particularly in light of the modifications we have made to the\n“access” definition discussed above. Last, we note that we have removed the requirement\nfrom the final definition that it would only be considered “use” if the action were “to\naccomplish a desired outcome or to achieve a desired purpose.” We do not believe this\nlanguage is necessary because the ultimate purpose of the “use” of the EHI is not relevant to\nthe definition of “use.”\n\nWe appreciate the comments suggesting that we look to more established definitions\nof “use,” such as that within the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We did consider adopting the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule definition, but ultimately decided that our finalized definition is more\nappropriate and easier to understand within the information blocking context. We also\nappreciate the comments suggesting that the proposed definition would inappropriately\nincrease administrative burden; however, we do not believe there is a basis for such assertion,\nparticularly with the clarifications we have provided and the focusing of the EHI definition.\n\n\n",

We proposed that the means of accessing,\nexchanging, and using EHI is not limited to functional elements and technical information but\nalso encompasses technologies, services, policies, and other conditions127\nnecessary to support\nthe many potential uses of EHI. Because of the evolving nature of technology and the\ndiversity of privacy and other laws and regulations, institutional arrangements, and policies\nthat govern the sharing of EHI, we did not provide an exhaustive list of interoperability\nelements in the Proposed Rule. We requested comment on the proposed definition.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters supported the proposed definition, noting that the\nbreadth and scope of the definition is appropriate. Some commenters requested clarifications\nand modifications regarding aspects of the proposed definition. A few commenters requested\nthat we clarify whether specific functionalities and technologies, such as certified Health IT\nModules and proprietary APIs, would be considered interoperability elements. A commenter\nrequested, within the context of the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303), clarification regarding\nwhether interoperability elements are limited to those elements to which an actor can lawfully\nconfer rights or licenses without the agreement of a third party. A few commenters stated that\nthe definition should exclude underlying substantive content or health facts because such\ncontent is not a potential means by which EHI may be accessed, exchanged, or used. One of\nthose commenters also requested that we clarify that legally required data tags are excluded\nfrom the “interoperability element” definition. A commenter suggested that we clarify that\nwhether a functionality is considered an interoperability element should be determined\n127\nSee ONC, Connecting Health and Care for the Nation: A Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap at x–xi,\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/interoperability-roadmap (Oct. 2015) [hereinafter “Interoperability\nRoadmap”].\n\n\n\n\nwithout regard to whether it can be protected under copyright or patent law. One commenter\nrequested additional examples of interoperability elements. Another commenter requested\nclarification regarding the meaning of “transmit” within the definition.\n\nSome commenters stated that the definition is too broad and should be narrowed. A\ncouple of commenters stated that the definition is confusing and ambiguous. A few\ncommenters noted that we should focus the definition on specific elements that are currently\ncertified and/or are employed to support interoperability through existing standards and\nrequirements that enable the exchange of EHI in a usable fashion.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ support of the proposed definition, as well as\nthe comments that requested clarifications and suggested improvements to the definition. We\nhave streamlined the definition, with the intent of maintaining a broad definition of\ninteroperability elements, and leveraged other regulatory and industry terms to add clarity. We\nhave finalized the definition of “interoperability element” to mean hardware, software,\nintegrated technologies or related licenses, technical information, privileges, rights,\nintellectual property, upgrades, or services that: (1) may be necessary to access, exchange, or\nuse EHI; and (2) is controlled by the actor, which includes the ability to confer all rights and\nauthorizations necessary to use the element to enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\nWhile this definition remains broad, it is confined by changes we have made to other\nparts of the information blocking section. Specifically, the more focused definitions of\n“electronic health information” and “access,” “exchange,” or “use” will result in a smaller\nscope of interoperability elements, as defined above, being necessary to enable access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. Further, under the Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301), we\nestablish that an actor is not required to respond to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI\nin the manner requested if the actor would be required to license its IP (which could constitute\n\n\n\n\nan interoperability element) and cannot reach agreeable terms for the license with the\nrequestor (§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)(B)). This means that actors who do not want to license their\ninteroperability elements will not be required to do so if they are able to respond in an\nalternative manner in accordance with § 171.301(b)(2).\n\nWe believe the above definition improves on the proposed definition in multiple ways.\n\nFirst, while preserving the meaning described in the Proposed Rule that would constitute an\ninteroperability element (i.e., hardware, software, technical information, technology, service,\nlicense, right, privilege), we have removed descriptive language and examples from the\nregulation text. Such language did not add clarity, as it was not exhaustive as noted in the\nregulation text, which included the language: “any other means by which electronic health\ninformation may be accessed, exchanged, or used.” The removal of this language makes the\ndefinition clearer and more concise. We note that we provide examples of “interoperability\nelements” in the discussion below.\n\nSecond, we leveraged the definition of “health information technology” from title XXX\nof the PHSA (specifically, section 3000(5) of the PHSA), as added by title XIII of the HITECH\nAct. The Cures Act amended title XXX of the PHSA to establish the information blocking\nprovision in section 3022 of the PHSA. Section 3000(5) of the PHSA defines “health information\ntechnology” as “hardware, software, integrated technologies or related licenses, intellectual\nproperty, upgrades, or packaged solutions sold as services that are designed for or support the\nuse by health care entities or patients for the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or\nexchange of health information.” We emphasize that this definition includes intellectual\nproperty.\n\nWhen we drafted the Proposed Rule, we chose to use the term “interoperability\nelement” to describe the means necessary to access, exchange, or use EHI instead of “health\n\n\n\n\nIT” because we believed that defining a new term (interoperability element) would allow us to\ntailor and focus the definition to the specific issue of information blocking. However, after\nfurther reflection and review of stakeholder comments—specifically those requesting\nadditional clarity regarding the definition of “interoperability element”—we believe a better\napproach is to leverage the definition of “health information technology” from section 3000(5)\nof the PHSA because that definition provides the statutory basis for the types of technology,\nservices, functionality necessary to support interoperability, including the access, exchange,\nand use of EHI. We believe this approach of leveraging an established, statutory definition\nwill promote transparency and clarify ONC’s expectations for regulated actors.\n\nAs such, we have added “integrated technologies,” “intellectual property,” and\n“upgrades” from the PHSA definition into our definition of interoperability element. These\nadditions will strengthen the “interoperability element” definition by explicitly identifying\ntypes of interoperability elements that would have been covered by our proposed definition,\nbut were not called out in the proposed definition (these types of interoperability elements\nwould have been covered by the provision in the proposed definition that an interoperability\nelement could be any other means by which EHI may be accessed, exchanged, or used). We\nchose not to substitute the PHSA health information technology definition in its entirety for\nthe “interoperability element” definition in this final rule because some aspects do not fit\nwithin the “interoperability element” definition. For instance, the concept of “packaged\nsolutions” is undefined and would not add clarity to the interoperability element definition.\n\nThus, we believe this approach will achieve our goal of establishing a definition of\ninteroperability element that is tailored for the information blocking context.\n\nLast, we have clarified within the definition that a requisite component of an\ninteroperability element is that it is controlled by the actor. As used in the interoperability\n\n\n\n\nelement definition, controlled by the actor includes the ability to confer all rights and\nauthorizations necessary to use the element to enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI. In\norder to make this point clear, we have added and finalized paragraph (2) within the\ninteroperability element definition (see § 171.102). Thus, if an actor could not confer a right or\nauthorization necessary to use the interoperability element to enable the access, exchange, or\nuse of electronic health information, (e.g., by way of sub-license or assignment), the actor\nwould not have the requisite “control” under the “interoperability element” definition. This\nclarification reinforces our position that our rule does not require or encourage actors to\ninfringe on IP rights.\n\nWe appreciate the comments that asked that we specify whether specific\nfunctionalities and technologies, such as certified Health IT Modules and proprietary APIs,\nwould be considered interoperability elements. We clarify that most certified Health IT\nModules and proprietary APIs would be considered interoperability elements under the\ninteroperability element definition. We also clarify that the underlying substantive content or\nhealth facts are not considered interoperability elements because substantive content and\nhealth facts are not a means by which EHI is accessed, exchanged, or used. Regarding legally\nrequired data tags, we would need additional information concerning the specific data tag to\ndetermine whether it could constitute an interoperability element. Generally, data tags would\nlikely be considered technical information under the “interoperability element” definition, but\nsuch data tags would need to be necessary to access, exchange, or use EHI to be considered an\ninteroperability element.\n\nA determination regarding whether a functionality is considered an interoperability\nelement will be determined without regard to whether it is protected under copyright or patent\nlaw. In fact, the finalized definition of interoperability element includes “licenses” and\n\n\n\n\n“intellectual property.” We have also established an exception to information blocking that\nsupports the licensing of intellectual property. Thus, we make clear that functionalities\ngenerally covered by copyright, patent, or other such laws can be interoperability elements.\n\nIn response to the commenter who requested additional examples of interoperability\nelements, we provide the following non-exhaustive list of examples:\n Functional elements of health IT that could be used to access, exchange, or use\nEHI for any purpose, including information exchanged or maintained in disparate\nmedia, information systems, or by HINs/HIEs;\n Technical information that describes the functional elements of technology, such\nas a standard, specification, protocol, data model, or schema, that would be\nrequired to use a functional element of a certain technology, including for the\npurpose of developing compatible technologies that incorporate or use the\nfunctional elements;\n System resources, technical infrastructure, or HIN/HIE elements that are required\nto enable the use of a compatible technology in production environments; or\n Licenses, rights, or privileges that may be required to commercially offer and\ndistribute compatible technologies and make them available for use in production\nenvironments.\n\nWe appreciate the comments requesting that we clarify and narrow the\n“interoperability element” definition. As discussed above, we believe the revised definition\naddresses commenters’ concerns regarding the clarity of the definition. Responsive to\ncommenters, the final definition is also narrower than the proposed definition, as we have\nremoved the proposed provision that an interoperability element could be any other means by\n\n\n\n\nwhich EHI may be accessed, exchanged, or used (see 84 FR 7602).\n\nWe have decided not to focus the definition on certified elements or existing standards\nor requirements because such a narrowed focus would unduly limit the definition,\ninteroperability, and the access, exchange, and use of EHI. The finalized definition reflects\nthat there are countless means by which EHI may be accessed, exchanged, or used that are not\ncertified or standardized. We note that the new Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301)\nsupports certified and standards-based exchange as suggested by the commenter. We refer\nreaders to VIII.D.2.a of this preamble for a discussion of that exception.\n\nWe note that we have removed the term “transmit” from the regulatory text because it\nno longer fit in the context of other changes made to the definition.\n\n\n",

In this section and elsewhere in the Proposed Rule, we discussed\nvarious types of hypothetical practices that could implicate the information blocking\nprovision. We did this to illustrate the scope of the information blocking provision and to\nexplain our interpretation of various statutory concepts. However, we stressed that the types of\npractices discussed in the preamble of the Proposed Rule are illustrative and not exhaustive\nand that many other types of practices could also implicate the provision. We emphasized that\nthe fact that we did not identify or discuss a particular type of practice did not imply that it is\nless serious than those that were discussed in the preamble. Indeed, we explained in the\nProposed Rule that because information blocking may take many forms, it is not possible to\nanticipate or catalog all potential types of practices that may raise information blocking\nconcerns.\n\n\n\n\nWe emphasized that any analysis of information blocking necessarily requires a\ncareful consideration of the individual facts and circumstances, including whether the practice\nwas required by law, whether the actor had the requisite knowledge, and whether an exception\napplies. A practice that seemingly meets the statutory definition of information blocking\nwould not be information blocking if it was required by law, if one or more elements of the\ndefinition were not met, or if it was covered by one of the exceptions for reasonable and\nnecessary activities.\n\nIn accordance with section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA, we proposed in the Proposed Rule\nto establish exceptions to the information blocking provision for certain reasonable and\nnecessary activities. We proposed that if an actor can establish that an exception applies to\neach practice for which a claim of information blocking has been made, including that the\nactor satisfied all applicable conditions of the exception at all relevant times, then the practice\nwould not constitute information blocking.\n\n*Comments.* There was broad support from commenters regarding the categories of\npractices identified in the Proposed Rule that may implicate the information blocking\nprovision, as well as the non-exhaustive list of specific examples provided in the Proposed\nRule to assist with compliance.

We have not revised\nthe examples provided in the Proposed Rule because we believe they are clear, accurate, and\nhelpful to readers. To be responsive to commenters who requested additional examples be\nadded to the final rule, we have added examples in the discussion of “Limiting or Restricting\nthe Interoperability of Health IT” in section VIII.C.6.c.ii. as well as additional examples\nwithin the preamble discussion for the exceptions. We used commenters’ suggestions to help\ninform these examples and highlight important use cases and circumstances that required\nadditional clarification. We emphasize that these listed examples are illustrative, but not\nexhaustive.\n\nWe also clarify that when we say that the actor must satisfy all applicable conditions of\nthe exception at all relevant times to meet each exception, all relevant times means any time\nwhen an actor’s practice relates to the access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\n\n",

Based on our\ninterpretation of the information blocking provision and the ordinary meanings of these terms\nin the context of EHI, we interpreted these terms to not be mutually exclusive. Instead,\nprevention and material discouragement may be understood as types of interference, and that\nuse of these terms in the statute to define information blocking illustrates the desire to reach\n\n\n\n\nall practices that an actor knows, or should know, are likely to prevent, materially discourage,\nor otherwise interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. Consistent with this\nunderstanding, we used the terms “interfere with” and “interference” as inclusive of\nprevention and material discouragement.\n\nWe explained that interference could take many forms. In addition to the prevention or\nmaterial discouragement of access, exchange, or use, we stated that interference could include\npractices that increase the cost, complexity, or other burdens associated with accessing,\nexchanging, or using EHI.

That is, the information blocking provision proscribes practices that are likely to\ninterfere with (including preventing or materially discouraging) access, exchange, or use of\nEHI—whether or not such harm materializes. By including both the likely and the actual\neffects of a practice, the information blocking provision encourages individuals and entities to\navoid engaging in practices that undermine interoperability, and to proactively promote\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI.\n\nWe explained that a practice would satisfy the information blocking provision’s\n“likelihood” requirement if, under the circumstances, there is a reasonably foreseeable risk\nthat the practice will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We explained that a\npolicy or practice that limits timely access to information in an appropriate electronic format\ncreates a reasonably foreseeable likelihood of interfering with the use of the information.\n\nWe noted that whether the risk of interference is reasonably foreseeable will depend on\nthe particular facts and circumstances attending the practice or practices at issue. Because of\nthe number and diversity of potential practices, and the fact that different practices will present\nvarying risks of interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI, we did not attempt to\nanticipate all of the potential ways in which the information blocking provision could be\nimplicated. Nevertheless, to assist with compliance, we clarified certain circumstances in\nwhich, based on our experience, a practice will almost always be likely to interfere with\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI. We cautioned that the situations listed are not exhaustive and\nthat other circumstances may also give rise to a very high likelihood of interference under the\ninformation blocking provision. We noted that in each case, the totality of the circumstances\n\n\n\n\nshould be evaluated as to whether a practice is likely to constitute information blocking.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we stated that we believe that information blocking concerns are\nespecially pronounced when the conduct at issue has the potential to interfere with the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI that is created or maintained during the practice of medicine or the\ndelivery of health care services to patients, which we referred to collectively as “observational\nhealth information” (84 FR 7516 and7517). We received a few comments seeking clarification\nregarding our use of the term “observational health information” or that we provide a\nregulatory definition for the term.\n\n*Comments.* We received some comments requesting clarification regarding the\nmeaning of “timely” access in the discussion in the Proposed Rule.\n\n*Response.* We have not established a set timeframe for what “timely” access means\nbecause there is so much variability regarding what “timely” will mean based on the specific\nfacts and circumstances, and particularly with regard to the broad scope of health IT being\ndiscussed. We emphasize that whether access is considered timely will be determined based\non the specific facts and circumstances. We refer readers to the discussion in section\nVIII.C.6.c. on “Limiting or Restricting the Interoperability of Health IT” where we discuss\nhow slowing or delaying access, exchange, or use of EHI could be considered information\nblocking.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any additional comments regarding out interpretation\nof the information blocking provision’s “likelihood” requirement discussed above.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized our interpretation as described above.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments requesting clarification regarding the meaning of\n“observational health information” as used in the Proposed Rule.\n\n*Response.* As discussed earlier in section VIII.C.3, after consideration of concerns\n\n\n\n\nraised by commenters, we have not finalized the definition of EHI as proposed. Instead, we\nhave finalized a more focused definition of EHI. Because we have finalized a definition of\nEHI with a more focused scope than proposed, we no longer believe our proposed approach\nregarding observational health information is necessary. Accordingly, we are not using the\nterm “observational health information” in this final rule. We refer readers to section VIII.C.3.\nfor further discussion of the definition of EHI.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "Circumstances of Reliance or Dependence\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that an actor may have substantial control over one\nor more interoperability elements that provide the only reasonable means of accessing,\nexchanging, or using EHI for a particular purpose. We noted that, in these circumstances, any\npractice by the actor that could impede the use of the interoperability elements—or that could\nunnecessarily increase the cost or other burden of using the elements—would almost always\n\n\n\n\nimplicate the information blocking provision.\n\nWe explained that the situation described above is most likely when customers or users\nare dependent on an actor’s technology or services, which can occur for any number of\nreasons. For example, technological dependence may arise from legal or commercial relations,\nsuch as a health care provider’s reliance on its EHR developer to ensure that EHI managed on\nits behalf is accessible and usable when it is needed. Relatedly, most EHI is currently stored in\nEHRs and other source systems that use proprietary data models or formats. Knowledge of the\ndata models, formats, or other relevant technical information (e.g., proprietary APIs) is\nnecessary to understand the data and make efficient use of it in other applications and\ntechnologies. Because this information is routinely treated as confidential or proprietary, the\ndeveloper’s cooperation is required to enable uses of the EHI that go beyond the capabilities\nprovided by the developer’s technology. This includes the capability to export complete\ninformation sets and to migrate data in the event that a user decides to switch to a different\ntechnology.\n\nWe noted that separate from these contractual and intellectual property issues, users\nmay become “locked in” to a particular technology, HIE, or HIN for financial or business\nreasons. For example, many health care providers have invested significant resources to adopt\nEHR technologies—including costs for deployment, customization, data migration, and\ntraining—and have tightly integrated these technologies into their information management\nstrategies, clinical workflows, and business operations. As a result, they may be reluctant to\nswitch to other technologies due to the significant cost and disruption this would entail.\n\nWe explained that another important driver of technological dependence is the\n“network effects” of health IT adoption, which are amplified by reliance on technologies and\napproaches that are not standardized and do not enable seamless interoperability.\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, health care providers and other health IT users may gravitate towards and\nbecome reliant on the proprietary technologies, HIEs, or HINs that have been adopted by other\nindividuals and entities with whom they have the greatest need to exchange EHI. We noted\nthat these effects may be especially pronounced within particular products or geographic\nareas. For example, a HIN that facilitates certain types of exchange or transactions may be so\nwidely adopted that it is a de facto industry standard. A similar phenomenon may occur within\na particular geographic area once a critical mass of hospitals, physicians, or other providers\nadopt a particular EHR technology, HIE, or HIN.\n\nWe emphasized that in these and other analogous circumstances of reliance or\ndependence, there is a heightened risk that an actor’s conduct will interfere with access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. To assist with compliance, we highlighted the following common\nscenarios, based on our outreach to stakeholders, in which actors exercise control over key\ninteroperability elements.128\nHealth IT developers of certified health IT that provide EHR systems or other\ntechnologies used to capture EHI at the point of care are in a unique position to control\nsubsequent access to and use of that information.\n\n HINs and HIEs may be in a unique position to control the flow of information among\nparticular persons or for particular purposes, especially if the HIN or HIE has achieved\nsignificant adoption in a particular geographic area or for a particular type of health\ninformation use case.\n\n Similar control over EHI may be exercised by other entities, such as health IT developers of\ncertified health IT, that supply or control proprietary technologies, platforms, or services that\n128\nAs an important clarification, we note that control over interoperability elements may exist with or without the\nactor’s ability to manipulate the price of the interoperability elements in the market.\n\n\n\n\nare widely adopted by a class of users or that are a “de facto standard” for certain types of EHI\nexchanges or transactions.\n\n Health care providers within health systems and other entities that provide health IT\nplatforms, infrastructure, or information sharing policies may have a degree of control over\ninteroperability or the movement of data within a geographic area that is functionally\nequivalent to the control exercised by a dominant health IT developer, HIN, or HIE.\n\nTo avoid engaging in conduct that may be considered information blocking, actors\nwith control over interoperability elements should be careful not to engage in practices that\nexclude persons from the use of those elements or create artificial costs or other impediments\nto their use.\n\nWe encouraged comment on these and other circumstances that may present an\nespecially high likelihood that a practice will interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI\nwithin the meaning of the information blocking provision.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters appreciated the examples provided and ONC’s\nacknowledgement in the Proposed Rule that certain parties are in a unique position to control\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI. Other commenters urged ONC to only hold accountable\nthose parties that actually have control of the EHI or control of interoperability elements\nnecessary to access, exchange, or use the EHI in question.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support. We stress that any analysis of\nwhether an actor’s practices constitute information blocking will depend on the particular facts\nand circumstances of the case, which may include an assessment of the actor’s control over\nthe EHI or interoperability elements necessary to access, exchange, or use the EHI in question,\nas applicable. A key element of information blocking is that the actor’s practice is likely to\ninterfere with an individual or entity’s ability to access, exchange, or use EHI. Thus, we look\n\n\n\n\nat accountability through the lens of whether the actor is the individual or entity engaging in\nthe practice.\n\nRegarding the comment that we should only hold accountable those parties that\nactually have control of the EHI or interoperability elements necessary to access, exchange, or\nuse the EHI, we note that we have addressed this issue within preamble discussion concerning\nthe definition of “interoperability element” (VIII.C.5.b), Infeasibility Exception (VIII.D.1.d),\nand Content and Manner Exception (VIII.D.2.a).

We noted that\none means by which actors may restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI is through formal\nrestrictions. These may be expressed in contract or license terms, EHI sharing policies,\norganizational policies or procedures, or other instruments or documents that set forth\nrequirements related to EHI or health IT. Additionally, in the absence of an express\ncontractual restriction, an actor may achieve the same result by exercising intellectual property\nor other rights in ways that restrict access, exchange, or use (84 FR 7518).\n\nWe explained that access, exchange, or use of EHI can also be restricted in less formal\nways. The information blocking provision may be implicated, for example, where an actor\nsimply refuses to exchange or to facilitate the access or use of EHI, either as a general practice\nor in isolated instances. The refusal may be expressly stated or it may be implied from the\nactor’s conduct, such as where the actor ignores requests to share EHI or provide\ninteroperability elements; gives implausible reasons for not doing so; or insists on terms or\nconditions that are so objectively unreasonable that they amount to a refusal to provide access,\nexchange, or use of the EHI (84 FR 7518).\n\nWe emphasized that restrictions on access, exchange, or use that are required by law\nwould not implicate the information blocking provision. Moreover, we recognized that some\nrestrictions, while not required by law, may be reasonable and necessary for the privacy and\n\n\n\n\nsecurity of individuals’ EHI and noted that such practices may qualify for protection under an\nexception (84 FR 7519).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested that we clarify the types of contract and agreement\nterms that could implicate the information blocking provision beyond terms specifying fees\nand the licensing of intellectual property rights. Some commenters stated that “legacy EHR\nplatforms” impede real time data flow between EHRs and the clinical workflow, including the\nuse of third-party clinical decision support applications, through various contract terms. Many\ncommenters also indicated that EHR developers place onerous contract terms on developers of\napplications that enable patient access to EHI through APIs. A few commenters asserted that a\nbusiness associate (BA), as defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, should not be liable under\nthe information blocking provision (or there should be an exception for information blocking)\nfor not responding to or fulfilling requests for access, exchange, or use of EHI if such access,\nexchange, or use of EHI would violate the BA’s business associate agreement (BAA).\n\n*Response.* We first clarify that all of the scenarios provided by the commenters might\nimplicate the information blocking provision. We offer specific situations as follows where\nthere might be an implication. As a first example, an actor (e.g., a health care provider that is\na covered entity under HIPAA) may want to engage an entity for services (e.g., use of a\nclinical decision support application (“CDS App Developer”)) that require the CDS App\nDeveloper to enter into a BAA with the health care provider and, in order to gain access and\nuse of the EHI held by another BA of the health care provider (e.g., EHR developer of\ncertified health IT), the CDS App Developer is required by the EHR developer of certified\nhealth IT to enter into a contract to access its EHR technology. As a second example, an entity\nmay offer an application that facilitates patients’ access to their EHI through an API\nmaintained by an actor (e.g., EHR developer of certified health IT) that is a BA of a health\n\n\n\n\ncare provider that is a covered entity under HIPAA. As a third example, a health care provider\nmay request EHI from an actor that is a BA of another health care provider under HIPAA,\nsuch as an EHR developer of certified health IT or HIN, that is contracted to make EHI\navailable for treatment purposes.\n\nIn response to comments and for the situations described above, we clarify that\ncontracts and agreements can interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI through\nterms besides those that specify unreasonable fees and commercially unreasonable licensing\nterms (see sections VIII.D.2.b (Fees) and VIII.D.2.c (Licensing) for further discussion of\nunreasonable fees and commercially unreasonable licensing terms and associated exceptions\nto the information blocking provision). For instance, a contract may implicate the information\nblocking provision if it included unconscionable terms for the access, exchange, or use of EHI\nor licensing of an interoperability element, which could include, but not be limited to,\nrequiring a software company that produced a patient access application to relinquish all IP\nrights to the actor or agreeing to indemnify the actor for acts beyond standard practice, such as\ngross negligence on part of the actor. Such terms may be problematic with regard to\ninformation blocking in situations involving unequal bargaining power related to accessing,\nexchanging, and using EHI.\n\nBusiness Associate Agreements (BAAs)\nWe designed the final rule to operate in a manner consistent with the framework of the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule and other laws providing privacy rights for patients. Foremost, we do\nnot require the disclosure of EHI in any way that would not already be permitted under the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule (or other Federal or State law). However, if an actor is permitted to\nprovide access, exchange, or use of EHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (or any other law),\nthen the information blocking provision would require that the actor provide that access,\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use of EHI so long as the actor is not prohibited by law from doing so (assuming\nthat no exception is available to the actor).\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a BAA must contain the elements specified in 45\nCFR 164.504(e), including a description of the permitted and required uses of PHI by the\nbusiness associate, and provide that the business associate will not use or further disclose the\nprotected health information other than as permitted or required by the contract or as required\nby law.129\nWhile the information blocking provision does not require actors to violate these\nagreements, a BAA or its associated service level agreements must not be used in a\ndiscriminatory manner by an actor to forbid or limit disclosures that otherwise would be\npermitted by the Privacy Rule. For example, a BAA entered into by one or more actors that\npermits access, exchange, or use of EHI by certain health care providers for treatment should\ngenerally not prohibit or limit the access, exchange, or use of the EHI for treatment by other\nhealth care providers of a patient.\n\nTo be clear, both the health care provider(s) who initiated the BAA and the BA who\nmay be an actor under the information blocking provision (e.g., a health IT developer of\ncertified health IT) would be subject to the information blocking provision in the instance\ndescribed above. To illustrate the potential culpability of a BA, a BA with significant market\npower may have contractually prohibited or made it difficult for its covered entity customers\nto exchange EHI, maintained by the BA, with health care providers that use an EHR system of\none of the BA’s competitors. To determine whether there is information blocking, the actions\nand processes (e.g., negotiations) of the actors in reaching the BAA and associated service\n129\n45 CFR 164.514(e)(3) limits the use and disclosure of a limited data set (LDS) to only the purposes of research,\npublic health or health care operations. Some of the other restrictions on use and disclosure by a party that receives\nLDS Recipient are similar to those imposed by the HIPAA Rules on business associates so the discussion that\nfollows generally applies to recipients of LDS and their data use agreements as well as to business associates (and\ntheir business associate agreements) to the extent of such similar provisions.\n\n\n\n\nlevel agreements would need to be reviewed to determine whether there was any action taken\nby an actor that was likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI, and whether\nthe actor had the requisite intent. We further note that if the BA has an agreement with the\ncovered entity to provide EHI to a third party that requests it and the BA refuses to provide\nthe access, exchange, or use of EHI to a requestor in response to the request received by the\nCE, then the BA (who is also an actor under the information blocking provision) may have\nviolated the information blocking provision unless an exception applied.\n\nSuccessors to Contractors and Agreements\nWe note that there may be circumstances in which there is a successor to a contract or\nagreement when, for example, an actor goes out of business, a provider leaves a practice, or an\nactor engages in a merger or adopts a new corporate structure. If not handled appropriately, it\nis possible that information blocking could occur.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We explained in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision includes\npractices that restrict the access, exchange, or use of EHI in various ways (see section\n3022(a)(2) of the PHSA). These practices could include, for example, disabling or restricting\nthe use of a capability that enables users to share EHI with users of other systems or to provide\naccess to EHI to certain types of persons or for certain purposes that are legally permissible. In\naddition, the information blocking provision may be implicated where an actor configures or\notherwise implements technology in ways that limit the types of data elements that can be\nexported or used from the technology. We noted that other practices that would be suspect\ninclude configuring capabilities in a way that removes important context, structure, or\nmeaning from the EHI, or that makes the data less accurate, complete, or usable for important\npurposes for which it may be needed. Likewise, implementing capabilities in ways that create\n\n\n\n\nunnecessary delays or response times, or that otherwise limit the timeliness of EHI accessed or\nexchanged, may interfere with the access, exchange, and use of that information and therefore\nimplicate the information blocking provision. We noted that any conclusions regarding such\ninterference would be based on fact-finding specific to each case and would need to consider\nthe applicability of the exceptions.\n\nWe explained that the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor\nwere to deploy technological measures that limit or restrict the ability to reverse engineer the\nfunctional aspects of technology in order to develop means for extracting and using EHI\nmaintained in the technology. We noted that this may include, for example, employing\ntechnological protection measures that, if circumvented, would trigger liability under the\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (see 17 U.S.C. 1201) or other laws.\n\nAdditional Examples\nIn the context of ONC’s certification rules, including certification criteria and\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, we provide the following more\nexplicit examples of actions by actors that would likely constitute information blocking.\n\nThe first example of a technical interference that restricts the interoperability of health\nIT relates to the publication of “FHIR service base URLs” (sometimes also referred to as\n“FHIR endpoints”). As discussed in the API Condition of Certification preamble (section\nVII.B.4), an API User needs to know a certified API technology’s FHIR service base URL to\ninteract with the certified API technology. This knowledge is foundational for the use of\ncertified API technology without special effort. Therefore, a FHIR service base URL cannot\nbe withheld by an actor as it (just like many other technical interfaces) is necessary to enable\nthe access, exchange, and use of EHI. Notably, in the case of patients seeking access to their\nEHI, the public availability of FHIR service base URLs is an absolute necessity and without\n\n\n\n\nwhich the access, exchange, and use of EHI would be prevented. Thus, any action by an actor\nto restrict the public availability of URLs in support of patient access would be more than just\nlikely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI; it would prevent such access,\nexchange, and use. Accordingly, as noted in § 170.404(b)(2), a Certified API Developer must\npublish FHIR service base URLs for certified API technology that can be used by patients to\naccess their electronic health information.\n\nConsistent with this example, the above interpretation means that API Information\nSources (i.e., health care providers) who locally manage their FHIR servers without Certified\nAPI Developer assistance cannot refuse to provide to Certified API Developers the FHIR\nservice base URL(s) that is/are necessary for patients to use to access their EHI. Equally,\npursuant to the Maintenance of Certification requirement finalized for Certified API\nDevelopers in § 170.404, they would be required to publish the FHIR service base URLs they\ncentrally manage on behalf of API Information Sources. We also clarify that the public\navailability of FHIR service base URLs is a requirement that is scoped specifically to the\ncontext of patients’ access to their EHI and is not intended to be interpreted as requiring all\nFHIR service base URLs to be made publicly available (i.e., FHIR service base URLs that are\ncreated and used among business partners would not need to be made publicly available).\n\nAlong the same lines discussed in the example directly above, for a patient to be able\nto use an application of their choice with certified API technology, the software application\nwill need to be “registered.” In that regard, as a second example, an actor’s refusal to register a\nsoftware application that enables a patient to access their EHI would effectively prevent its use\ngiven that registration is a technical prerequisite for software applications to be able to connect\nto certified API technology. As a result, such refusals in the context of patient access unless\notherwise addressed in this rule would be highly suspect and likely to implicate information\n\n\n\n\nblocking. We note, however, for the first and second example that neither app registration nor\nthe public availability of a FHIR service base URL means that an application will be able to\naccess any EHI. On the contrary, the application would be unable to do so unless a patient\nauthenticates themselves via an appropriate workflow or, in the case of a health care provider,\nthe application is appropriately configured to work within the provider’s IT infrastructure.\n\nAs a third example, there is often specific information that may be necessary for\ncertain actors, in this case health care providers, to effectively access, exchange, and use EHI\nvia their Certified EHR Technology and certified Health IT Modules. A health care provider’s\n“direct address” is an example of this kind of information. If this information were not made\nknown to a health care provider upon request, were inaccessible or hidden in a way that a\nhealth care provider could not identify (or find out) their own direct address, or were refused\nto be provided to a health care provider by a health IT developer with certified health IT, we\nwould consider all such actions to be information blocking because knowledge of a direct\naddress is necessary to fully engage in the exchange of EHI.\n\nAs a last example, we note that, to the extent that a legal transfer of IP to an individual\nor entity that is not an actor is intended to facilitate circumvention of the information blocking\nprovision, the transfer itself by an actor could be considered an interference with the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI.\n\nWe note that we have added definitions of “API Information Source,” “API User,”\n\n“Certified API Developer,” and “certified API technology” to § 171.102. Each of those terms\nis defined as they are in § 170.404(c). We note that “API Information Source” replaced the\nproposed definition of “API Data Provider” and “Certified API Developer” replaced the\nproposed definition of “API Technology Supplier” in order to align with the terms used in §\n170.404(c) (see the proposed terms in 84 FR 7601).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested that we provide further clarity on whether\nslowing or delaying access, exchange, or use of EHI could be considered information\nblocking.\n\n*Response.* We clarify that slowing or delaying access, exchange, or use of EHI could\nconstitute an “interference” and implicate the information blocking provision. We understand\nthat some delays may be legitimate and inevitable due to factors such as limited legal, project\nmanagement, and technical resources. Notwithstanding such understandable challenges, we\nare aware that some actors use and embellish legitimate challenges to create extended and\nunnecessary delays. For instance, an actor could have legitimate technical scoping and\narchitecture questions regarding data integrations that require attention and take time to\naddress. However, these scoping and architecture questions could constitute interference and\nimplicate the information blocking provision if they are not necessary to enable access,\nexchange, or use of EHI and are being utilized as a delay tactic. When assessing such\npractices, facts indicating that an actor created extended or unnecessary delays may be\nevidence of an actor’s intent. We expect actors to make good faith efforts to work through\ncommon and understandable challenges and limitations to enable requestors to access,\nexchange, and use EHI as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "Use or Health IT-enabled Care Delivery\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the information blocking provision\nencompasses practices that create impediments to innovations and advancements to the access,\nexchange, and use of EHI, including care delivery enabled by health IT (section\n3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the PHSA). Importantly, the information blocking provision may be\nimplicated and penalties or appropriate disincentives may apply if an actor were to engage in\n\n\n\n\nexclusionary, discriminatory, or other practices that impede the development, dissemination,\nor use of interoperable technologies and services that enhance access, exchange, or use of\nEHI.\n\nWe emphasized that, most acutely, the information blocking provision may be\nimplicated if an actor were to refuse to license or allow the disclosure of interoperability\nelements to persons who require those elements to develop and provide interoperable\ntechnologies or services—including those that might complement or compete with the actor’s\nown technology or services. The same would be true if the actor were to allow access to\ninteroperability elements but were to restrict their use for these purposes. We provided a list of\nnon-exhaustive examples to illustrate practices that would likely implicate the information\nblocking provision by interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI (84 FR 7519 and\n7520). We encourage readers to review those examples in the Proposed Rule, as they are still\napplicable.\n\nWe explained that, rather than restricting interoperability elements, an actor may insist\non terms or conditions that are burdensome and discourage their use. These practices may\nimplicate the information blocking provision as well. We have chosen not to include those\nexamples in this final rule, but emphasize that they are still applicable and encourage readers\nto review the examples in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7520).\n\nWe explained that the information blocking provision may also be implicated if an\nactor were to discourage efforts to develop or use interoperable technologies or services by\nexercising its influence over customers, users, or other persons, and we provided a non-\nexhaustive list of examples. We have chosen not to include those examples in this final rule,\nbut emphasize that they are still applicable and encourage readers to review the examples in\nthe Proposed Rule (84 FR 7520).We noted that similar concerns would arise were an actor to\n\n\n\n\nengage in discriminatory practices—such as imposing unnecessary and burdensome\nadministrative, technical, contractual, or other requirements on certain persons or classes of\npersons—that interfere with access and exchange of EHI by frustrating or discouraging efforts\nto enable interoperability. We provided a list of non- exhaustive examples to illustrate some\nways this could occur. We have chosen not to include those examples in this final rule, but\nemphasize that they are still applicable and encourage readers to review the examples in the\nProposed Rule (84 FR 7520).\n\nNot all instances of differential treatment would necessarily constitute a discriminatory\npractice that may implicate the information blocking provision. For example, we explained\nthat different fee structures or other terms may reflect genuine differences in the cost, quality,\nor value of the EHI and the effort required to provide access, exchange, or use. We also noted\nthat, in certain circumstances, it may be reasonable and necessary for an actor to restrict or\nimpose reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or conditions on the use of interoperability\nelements, even though such practices could implicate the information blocking provision. For\nthis reason, and as further explained in section VIII.D, we proposed to establish a narrow\nexception for licensing interoperability elements (see § 171.303) that would apply to these\ntypes of practices.\n\n*Comments.* We received some recommendations to describe specific scenarios when a\nrefusal to license would be considered information blocking.\n\n*Response.* We note that for the purposes of the categories of practices described in the\nProposed Rule (84 FR 7518 through 7521), we did not consider the applicability of any\nexceptions, and strongly encouraged readers to review the discussion of practices in this\nsection in conjunction with the section on the exceptions (84 FR 7518). Regarding the specific\ncomment above regarding licensing, we direct readers to our discussion of the Licensing\n\n\n\n\nException (section VIII.D.2.c.) for additional examples and a discussion of substantive\nconditions we have finalized for the licensing of interoperability elements under the exception.\n\nWe note one important clarification that applies to all examples in the Proposed Rule\nconcerning the licensing of interoperability elements. As clarified in the Licensing Exception\npreamble discussion, an actor will not implicate the information blocking provision in\ncircumstances where the entity requesting to license or use the interoperability element is not\nseeking to use the interoperability element to interoperate with either the actor or the actor’s\ncustomers in order for EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used. In other words, if there is no\nnexus between a requestor’s need to license an interoperability element and existing EHI, an\nactor’s refusal to license the interoperability element altogether or in accordance with §\n171.303 would not constitute an interference under the information blocking provision. We\nrefer readers to the Licensing Exception preamble discussion in section VIII.D.2.c.\n\nInterference Versus Education When an Individual Chooses Technology to Facilitate\nAccess\nIn the Proposed Rule, we stated that the information blocking provision would likely\nbe implicated when an EHR developer of certified health IT requires third-party applications\nto be “vetted” for security before use but does not promptly conduct the vetting or conducts\nthe vetting in a discriminatory or exclusionary manner (84 FR 7519). We also stated under the\nproposed “promoting the privacy of EHI” exception that when the consent or authorization of\nan individual was necessary for access, exchange, or use of EHI, to qualify for the exception,\nan actor must not have improperly encouraged or induced the individual to not provide the\nconsent or authorization. We further stated that this does not mean that an actor cannot inform\nan individual about the advantages and disadvantages of exchanging EHI and any associated\nrisks, so long as the information communicated is accurate and legitimate. However, we noted\n\n\n\n\nthat an actor could not mislead an individual about the nature of the consent to be provided,\ndissuade individuals from providing consent in respect of disclosures to the actor’s\ncompetitors, or impose onerous requirements to effectuate consent that were unnecessary and\nnot required by law (84 FR 7531).\n\nOverview of Comments\nCommenters expressed concerns that app developers not covered by the HIPAA Rules\nfrequently do not provide patients (individuals) with clear terms of how their EHI will be\nsubsequently used by the app developer once patients authorize (approve) the app to receive\ntheir EHI. These commenters, many of whom would be actors under the information blocking\nprovision, expressed these concerns in comments recited below, while also requesting\nclarification about what steps they may take to assist individuals in protecting the privacy and\nsecurity of their EHI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested that we clarify the extent of vetting that would be\npermitted by actors for third-party apps.\n\n*Response.* We first clarify that the example provided in the Proposed Rule and recited\nabove was to illuminate practices, such as delaying access and discriminatory behavior, which\ncould implicate the information blocking provision. “Vetting” in the example’s context meant\na determination regarding whether the app posed a security risk to the EHR developer’s API,\nwhich may be the situation with a proprietary API. For certified API technology, which\nincludes the use of OAuth2 among other security requirements in addition to its focus on\n“read-only”/responses to requests for EHI to be transmitted, there should be few, if any,\nsecurity concerns about the risks posed by patient-facing apps to the disclosing actor’s health\nIT systems (because the apps would only be permitted to receive EHI at the patient’s\ndirection). Thus, for third-party applications chosen by individuals to facilitate their access to\n\n\n\n\ntheir EHI held by actors, there would generally not be a need for “vetting” on security grounds\nand such vetting actions otherwise would be an interference. We refer readers to our\ndiscussion of “vetting” versus verifying an app developer’s authenticity under the API\nCondition of Certification earlier in section VII.B.4 of this preamble. We do note, however,\nthat actors, such as health care providers, have the ability to conduct whatever “vetting” they\ndeem necessary of entities (e.g., app developers) that would be their business associates under\nHIPAA before granting access and use of EHI to the entities. In this regard, covered entities\nmust conduct necessary vetting in order to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters stated that the information blocking proposals would\nopen the door for third-party apps (e.g., patient-facing apps) to access, exchange, and use\ncopious amounts of patient data without providing patients with clear terms of use.\n\nCommenters stated that most individuals may be surprised when commercial application\ncompanies that are not subject to the HIPAA Rules shared health information obtained from a\nhospital or health plan, such as diagnoses, medications, or test results, in ways the HIPAA\nRules would not permit. These commenters asserted that individuals would incorrectly blame\nthe hospital or health plan if a third-party app developer sold their EHI or used it for marketing\nor other purposes. Additionally, the commenters contended that because the third-party apps\nand the third-party app developers are not subject to the HIPAA Rules, such developers may,\nthrough their apps’ required terms of use, grant the developers the right to sell the EHI\nreceived or generated by the app without the individual’s consent or could expose all of the\nindividual’s EHI without the individual’s knowledge.\n\n*Response.* This final rule supports an individual’s ability to choose which third-party\ndeveloper and app are best for receiving all or part of their EHI from a health care provider\nand to agree to clear and public terms of use on how that initial and ongoing engagement with\n\n\n\n\nthe third-party developer and app occurs. As discussed in more detail below, this final rule\nalso supports and strongly encourages providing individuals with information that will assist\nthem in making the best choice for themselves in selecting a third-party application. We\nbelieve that allowing actors to provide additional information to individuals about apps will\nassist individuals as they choose apps to receive their EHI and such an approach is consistent\nwith statements in the Proposed Rule recited above regarding informing individuals about the\nadvantages and disadvantages of exchanging EHI and any associated risks. Individuals\nconcerned about information privacy and security can gain a better understanding about how\nthe third-party apps are using and storing their EHI, how individuals will be able to exercise\nany consent options, and more about what individuals are consenting to before they allow the\napp to receive their EHI.\n\nPractices that purport to educate patients about the privacy and security practices of\napplications and parties to whom a patient chooses to receive their EHI may be reviewed by\nOIG or ONC, as applicable, if there was a claim of information blocking. However, we\nbelieve it is unlikely these practices would interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI\nif they meet certain criteria. Foremost, the information provided by actors must focus on any\ncurrent privacy and/or security risks posed by the technology or the third-party developer of\nthe technology. Second, this information must be factually accurate, unbiased, objective, and\nnot unfair or deceptive. Finally, the information must be provided in a non-discriminatory\nmanner. For example, all third-party apps must be treated the same way in terms of whether or\nnot information is provided to individuals about the privacy and security practices employed.\n\nTo be clear, an actor may not prevent an individual from deciding to provide its EHI to a\ntechnology developer or app despite any risks noted regarding the app itself or the third-party\ndeveloper.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that we require actors, including API\ntechnology suppliers, to verify the existence of a privacy notice for each application\nrequesting registration by an API User (third-party app developer). Commenters also\nsuggested that the privacy notices should be commensurate with ONC’s Model Privacy Notice\n(MPN). One commenter recommended that all third-party developers should have to attest\n“yes” or “no” to having a privacy notice for each app it makes available for use/(for patients to\nuse) to access EHI. The commenter asserted that requiring attestation would provide\ntransparency about the existence or lack of privacy policies and practices and data uses and\nserve as a means to support enforcement of acts of deceptive or misleading conduct in relation\nto stated privacy policies and practices.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, an actor may provide factually accurate, objective,\nunbiased, fair, and non-discriminatory information about the third party or third-party app that\nan individual chooses to use to receive EHI on their behalf. And as also noted above, we\nstrongly encourage actors to educate patients and individuals about the risks of providing\nother entities or parties access to their EHI. This type of education can be designed to inform\nthe patient about the privacy and security practices of the third party and the third-party app,\nincluding whether the third-party developer has not acted in accordance with elements of its\nprivacy policy. In this regard, we think there are many efficient and allowable ways of\nproviding such education without such practices being considered or creating an interference\nunder the information blocking provision, including those similar to the one suggested by the\ncommenter.\n\nFor example, to the commenter’s specific point, actors may establish processes where\nthey notify a patient, call to a patient’s attention, or display in advance (as part of the app\nauthorization process with certified API technology) whether the third-party developer of the\n\n\n\n\napp that the patient is about to authorize to receive their EHI has attested in the positive or\nnegative whether the third party’s privacy policy and practices (including security practices\nsuch as whether the app encrypts the EHI) meet certain “best practices” set by the market for\nprivacy policies and practices. We note that we identify minimum best practices for third-\nparty privacy policies and practices below. This notification, would enable a patient to pause,\nconsider this educational information provided by the actor, and decide whether to proceed\nwith approving the app to receive their EHI or to stop mid-way in the process to do more\nresearch into the app or to pick a different app, in which case the patient would not approve\nthe original app in question to receive their EHI. Understandably, in order for an actor to\nexecute this kind of notification or attention grabbing process and to attribute certain app\ndeveloper practices to educational insights provided to a patient in real-time, certain\ninformation may need to be collected by an actor in advance. Such information may include\nwhether the app developer has a privacy notice, policies, or practices. Actors providing\npatients with educational information (a notice) could help patients better understand how\ntheir EHI may be used by the app and the third-party developer.\n\nWhile the ONC 2018 MPN is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help\ndevelopers clearly convey comprehensive information about their privacy and security\npolicies and practices to their users, the privacy notice and practices of a third-party\ndeveloper’s app or personal health record does not have to be identical to the ONC’s 2018\nMPN. There may be other privacy policies and practices (including security practices) of\nthird-party developers and apps that accomplish the same goals and even provide more\ninformation relevant to a user. At a minimum, as it relates to the above, all third-party privacy\npolicies and practices should adhere to the following:\n(1) The privacy policy is made publicly accessible at all times, including updated\n\n\n\n\nversions;\n(2) The privacy policy is shared with all individuals that use the technology prior to the\ntechnology’s receipt of EHI from an actor;\n(3) The privacy policy is written in plain language and in a manner calculated to\ninform the individual who uses the technology;\n(4) The privacy policy includes a statement of whether and how the individual’s EHI\nmay be accessed, exchanged, or used by any other person or other entity, including whether\nthe individual’s EHI may be sold at any time (including in the future); and\n(5) The privacy policy includes a requirement for express consent from the individual\nbefore the individual’s EHI is accessed, exchanged, or used, including receiving the\nindividual’s express consent before the individual’s EHI is sold (other than disclosures\nrequired by law or disclosures necessary in connection with the sale of the application or a\nsimilar transaction).\n\nWe note that the market may set different and more stringent expectations for third-\nparty privacy notices and practices than the above minimum. As described above and in the\nexamples below, an actor may provide information or notice to the individual whose EHI is\nrequested from the actor that the privacy policy that applies to the technology used to make\nthe request does or does not meet the minimum privacy policy notice and practices outlined\nabove.\n\nExample 1: Providing education to an individual of a third-party app developer’s\nprivacy and security policies and practices through an automated attestation and\nwarning process.\n\nAn API User (third-party app developer) develops a software application (named\n“App-Y”) and registers it with the Certified API Developer’s (developer of certified health IT)\n\n\n\n\nauthorization server. During the registration process, the Certified API Developer requests, as\na business associate and on behalf of a HIPAA covered entity, that the API User attest that for\nApp-Y, the API User follows the privacy policies and practices outlined above. Given the “yes\nor no” choice, the API User attests “no.” The Certified API Developer completes App-Y’s\nregistration process and provides it with a client identifier. An individual seeks to use App-Y\nto obtain their EHI from the health care provider (covered entity) that is a customer of the\nCertified API Developer. The individual then opens App-Y on their smartphone and after\nauthenticating themselves to their health care provider (covered entity), but prior to the app\nreceiving the EHI from the health care provider, the patient is provided with an app\nauthorization screen controlled by the health care provider.\n\nUsing the certified API technology and the normal OAuth2 workflow the patient is\nasked by the health care provider via the app authorization screen whether they want to\napprove or reject App-Y’s ability to receive their EHI via certified API technology. On the\nauthorization screen, there is a “warning” from the health care provider that the application\nhas not “attested” to having privacy policies and practices that adhere to the minimum policies\nand practices outlined above or to having other specified privacy and security policies. When\npresented with that warning, the patient has two choices: (1) choose to ignore the warning and\napprove App-Y’s ability to receive their EHI and App-Y receives the patient’s PHI; or (2)\nreject App-Y’s ability to receive their EHI, and the health care provider does not provide the\npatient’s EHI to App-Y.\n\nExample 2: Patient sending EHI using certified health IT capabilities provided by\nhealth IT developer.\n\nAn individual has made an appointment with a health care specialist for a second\nmedical opinion. During the initial scheduling, the administrative staff requested that the\n\n\n\n\nindividual bring all their prior health information to the specialist. The patient portal of the\nindividual’s primary care provider allows EHI to be transmitted to a third party using Direct\nprotocol. The individual identifies a third-party app that is able to receive EHI using Direct\nprotocol and creates an account with the app as well as obtain/create a “Direct address.”\n\nDuring the account creation process with the app, the individual reviews the “privacy policy”\nfor the app. The third-party app also sends the individual a copy of the privacy policy via\nemail once the individual completes the account creation process.\n\nSubsequently, the individual logs into the primary care provider’s portal to transmit\nher EHI to her direct address linked to her new account on the third-party app. Her provider\nuses certified health IT that is capable of sending EHI securely using Direct protocol to third-\nparty organizations (including apps) with which they have exchanged trust anchors. It turns\nout, the health care provider has established prior trust with the third-party app and is able to\nsend EHI to the application. To note, this health care provider may offer education, including\na warning (notice), to the patient, as discussed above, if the provider is being directed by the\npatient to transmit their EHI to a recipient that is unknown to the provider.\n\nPrior to sending the EHI, the portal provides a summary screen that provides the\nprivacy policy “warning” about the third-party app. The patient reviews and accepts it. The\nprovider’s system/API technology sends EHI to her Direct address. The patient logs into her\napplication and confirms that the EHI has been received.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters stated that, given the access to personal health information\nthat patient-directed third-party apps are expected to have and the potential privacy risks they\npose, a process should be implemented by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to vet apps\nfor the adequacy of the consumer disclosures which should include the privacy and security of\nthe information and secondary uses that should be permitted. A commenter suggested that the\n\n\n\n\nvetting process should be at the application and application developer level, and that the\nresults of such vetting process should be made public in the form of an application “safe list.”\n\n*Response.* The privacy practices of developers of patient-facing health IT products and\nservices are typically regulated by the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The FTC\nAct prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce (15 U.S.C. §\n45(a)(1)), but it does not prescribe specific privacy requirements. The FTC has authority to\nenforce the FTC Act’s prohibition on deception, for example, by challenging deceptive\nstatements made in privacy policies, user interfaces, FAQs, or other consumer-facing\nmaterials. The FTC could also, for example, challenge a particular use or disclosure of EHI as\nunfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably\navoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to\nconsumers or to competition (15 U.S.C. § 45(n)). We will continue to work with our Federal\npartners, including the FTC, to assess education opportunities for consumers and app\ndevelopers about the privacy and security of EHI collected, used, or received by health apps.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended the development of a privacy framework\nregarding how health information should be shared and to empowering consumers; and it\nnoted that it should be developed and matured in concert with the modernization of our\nnation’s health IT infrastructure. They expressed that there are private sector and public-\nprivate examples of models that we should look to from both health care and other industries.\n\nThey believed that the Proposed Rule does not, however, fully address patient and consumer\nprivacy protections. They recommended that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nand ONC should work together with relevant agencies and departments and private-sector\ncolleagues to develop a companion consumer privacy framework.\n\n*Response.* We are aware of various industry initiatives regarding a “privacy\n\n\n\n\nframework.” We have previously published the Nationwide Privacy and Security Framework\nfor Electronic Exchange of Individually Identifiable Health Information130\n; produced, in\ncooperation with the FTC, FDA, and OCR, the Mobile Health Apps Interactive Tool131\n; and\nmore recently published and developed the Privacy and Security Framework for Patient-\nCentered Outcomes Research (PCOR). This project developed tools and resources that address\nthe many different types of data that can be used to conduct patient-centered outcomes\nresearch. The framework consists of two initiatives: The Legal and Ethical Architecture for\nPCOR Data (Architecture), which guides readers through the responsible use and protection of\nelectronic health data for PCOR and The Patient Choice Technical Project which harmonized\nexisting technical mechanisms to enable interoperable exchange of patient consent for basic\nand granular choice for research and treatment, payment, and health care operations. This\nproject, which remains active, also identifies, tests and validates technical standards that\nsupport an individual’s consent preferences.132\nWe will continue to monitor how individuals are educated about potential privacy and\nsecurity risks of third-party apps and will continue to work with HHS OCR and industry\nstakeholders to further educate individuals as part of our implementation of section 4006 of\nthe Cures Act. In this regard, we also encourage individuals to review consumer education\nmaterials related to protecting their EHI on our website at healthit.gov (“What You Can do to\nProtection Your Health Information” - https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security/what-\nyou-can-do-protect-your-health-information; and “Health IT: How to Keep Your Health\nInformation Privacy and Secure: Fact Sheet” -\n130\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/nationwide-ps-framework-5.pdf\n131\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/mobile-health-apps-interactive-tool\n132\nSee https://www.healthit.gov/topic/scientific-initiatives/pcor/privacy-and-security-framework-pcor-psp.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/how_to_keep_your_health_information_private_an\nd_secure.pdf).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concerns that if patients access their health data—\nsome of which could contain family history and could be sensitive—through a smartphone,\nthey should have a clear understanding of the potential uses of that data by third-party app\nsuppliers.\n\n*Response.* Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, when a covered health care provider, in the\ncourse of treating an individual, collects or otherwise obtains an individual’s family medical\nhistory, this information may become part of the individual’s medical record (45 C.F.R.\n\n164.501 (definition of “Designated Record Set”). Thus, if the family medical history becomes\npart of the medical record, the individual/patient may exercise the rights under the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule, 45 C.F.R. 164.524, to this information in the same fashion as any other\ninformation in the medical record, including the right of access. As discussed above, actors\nmay educate patients of the risks related to providing other persons and entities with their EHI,\nincluding the various the types of EHI (e.g., family health history) that will be provided to an\nentity (e.g., third-party app) at the patient’s request.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "Certain practices that artificially increase the cost and expense associated with\naccessing, exchanging, and using EHI may implicate the information blocking provision. We\nemphasized in the Proposed Rule that such practices are plainly contrary to the information\nblocking provision and the concerns that motivated its enactment.\n\nWe explained that an actor may seek to extract profits or capture revenue streams that\nwould be unobtainable without control of a technology or other interoperability elements that\nare necessary to enable or facilitate access, exchange, or use of EHI. Most EHI is currently\n\n\n\n\nstored in EHRs and other source systems that use proprietary data models or formats; this puts\nEHR developers (and other actors that control data models or standards) in a unique position\nto block access to (including the export and portability of) EHI for use in competing systems\nor applications or to charge rents for access to the basic technical information needed to\naccomplish the access, exchange, or use of EHI for these purposes. We emphasized that these\ninformation blocking concerns may be compounded to the extent that EHR developers do not\ndisclose, in advance, the fees they will charge for interfaces, data export, data portability, and\nother interoperability-related services (see 80 FR 62719 through 62725; 80 FR 16880 through\n16881). We noted that these concerns are not limited to EHR developers. Other actors who\nexercise substantial control over EHI or essential interoperability elements may engage in\nanalogous behaviors that would implicate the information blocking provision (84 FR 7520).\n\nTo illustrate, we provided a list of non-exhaustive examples that reflected some of the\nmore common types of rent-seeking and opportunistic behaviors of which we were aware and\nthat are likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. Those examples are still\napplicable and we encourage readers to review the examples in the Proposed Rule (84 FR\n7520 and 7521).\n\nThe information blocking provision may be implicated by these and other practices by\nwhich an actor profits from its unreasonable control over EHI or interoperability elements\nwithout adding any efficiency to the health care system or serving any other pro-competitive\npurpose. However, we stressed that the reach of the information blocking provision is not\nlimited to these types of practices. We interpreted the definition of information blocking to\nencompass any fee that materially discourages or otherwise imposes a material impediment to\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI. We used the term “fee” in the broadest possible sense to refer\nto any present or future obligation to pay money or provide any other thing of value and\n\n\n\n\nproposed to include this definition in § 171.102. We noted that this scope may be broader than\nnecessary to address genuine information blocking concerns and could unnecessarily diminish\ninvestment and innovation in interoperable technologies and services. Therefore, as further\nexplained in section VIII.D, we proposed to create an exception that, subject to certain\nconditions, would permit the recovery of costs that are reasonably incurred to provide access,\nexchange, and use of EHI (84 FR 7521).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specifically on our proposed definition of\n“fee.”\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the definition in § 171.102 as proposed.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested additional examples and clarity on the types\nof rent-seeking and opportunistic pricing practices that would be likely to implicate the\ninformation blocking provision.\n\n*Response.* We refer readers to our discussion of the Fees Exception (section\nVIII.D.2.b.) for additional examples, as well as for a detailed discussion of fees that may and\nmay not be charged under this exception.\n\n\n",

In\ngeneral, this type of interference is likely to occur when, despite the availability of generally\naccepted technical, policy, or other approaches that are suitable for achieving a particular\nimplementation objective, an actor does not implement the standard, does not implement\nupdates to the standard, or implements the standard in a way that materially deviates from its\nformal specifications. We noted that these practices lead to unnecessary complexity and\n\n\n\n\nburden, such as the additional cost and effort required to implement and maintain “point-to-\npoint” connections, custom-built interfaces, and one-off trust agreements.\n\nWhile each case will necessarily depend on its individual facts, and while we\nrecognized that the development and adoption of standards across the health IT industry is an\nongoing process, we explained that the information blocking provision would be implicated in\nat least two distinct sets of circumstances. First, we stated that information blocking may arise\nwhere an actor chooses not to adopt, or to materially deviate from, relevant standards,\nimplementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary under section\n3004 of the PHSA. Second, even where no federally adopted or identified standard exists, if a\nparticular implementation approach has been broadly adopted in a relevant industry segment,\ndeviations from that approach would be suspect unless strictly necessary to achieve substantial\nefficiencies.\n\nTo further illustrate these types of practices that may implicate the information\nblocking provision, we provided a list of non-exhaustive examples of conduct that would be\nlikely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We have chosen not to include those\nexamples in this final rule, but emphasize that they are still applicable and encourage readers\nto review the examples in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7521).\n\nWe explained that even where no standards exist for a particular purpose, actors\nshould not design or implement health IT in non-standard ways that unnecessarily increase the\ncosts, complexity, and other burdens of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. We also noted\nthat we were aware that some actors attribute certain non-standard implementations on legacy\nsystems that the actor did not themselves design but which have to be integrated into the\nactor’s health IT. We noted that such instances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested additional clarity on when non-standard\n\n\n\n\nbased interoperability is permissible. Some commenters urged ONC to be careful and flexible\nin its interpretation of this information blocking practice given the complexities of health IT\nimplementation, such as implementing newly adopted standards or requirements. One\ncommenter highlighted the importance of being able to retain certain types of optionality,\nespecially for specialized use cases. Other commenters expressed concern that considering\nnon-standard implementation practices as likely to implicate the information blocking\nprovision could have the unintended consequence of stymying innovative or novel\ntechnologies used in information exchange.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the commenters’ suggestions. We emphasize that the\nproblematic nature of non-standard design and implementation choices was identified by\nCongress in section 3022(a)(2)(B) of the PHSA, which states that information blocking may\ninclude implementing health IT in non-standard ways that are likely to substantially increase\nthe complexity or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. We continue to be\nconcerned that these practices will lead to unnecessary complexity and burden related to the\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI, and depending on the circumstances, we maintain that such\npractices would be likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We refer readers to\nthe discussion of this topic in the Fees Exception (section VIII.D.2.b).\n\nWe also agree, however, that we must give each case careful consideration and assess\nthe individual facts and circumstances to determine whether such practices would be likely to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\n\n",

Section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA\ndefines information blocking by referring to practices likely to interfere with, prevent or\nmaterially discourage access, exchange or use of electronic health information. Based on this\nterminology used in the PHSA, we noted that conduct that implicates the information blocking\nprovision and that does not fall within one of the exceptions or does not meet all conditions\nfor an exception, would be considered a “practice.” Conduct that falls within an exception and\nmeets all the applicable conditions for that exception would be considered an “activity.” We\nnoted that the challenge with this distinction is that when examining conduct that is the subject\nof an information blocking claim— an actor’s actions that are likely to interfere with access,\nexchange, or use of EHI—it can be illusory to distinguish, on its face, conduct that is a\npractice and conduct that is an activity. Indeed, conduct that implicates the information\nblocking provision but falls within an exception could nonetheless be considered information\nblocking if the actor has not satisfied the conditions applicable to that exception.\n\nAcknowledging the terminology used in the PHSA, we proposed to define “practice”\nin § 171.102 as one or more related acts or omissions by an actor.\n\nWe also proposed to use the term “practice” throughout the Proposed Rule when we\ndescribed conduct that is likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI, and clarify when describing the conduct at issue whether it is a\npractice that is information blocking, a practice that implicates the information blocking\nprovision, or a practice that is reasonable and necessary and not information blocking (84 FR\n7522). We stated that adopting the terminology of “activity” to describe conduct that may or\nmay not be information blocking would be confusing and obfuscate our intent in certain\ncircumstances. Consistent with this approach, when describing the exceptions in the final rule,\nwe describe practices that, if all the applicable conditions are met, are reasonable and\n\n\n\n\nnecessary and not information blocking.\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments specifically on the distinction between\n“activities” and “practices” and our proposed definition and use of the term “practice.”\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the definition of “practice” in § 171.102 as “an act or\nomission by an actor.” This definition is a modification of the proposed definition, which was\n“one or more related acts or omissions by an actor.” We finalized this definition of “practice”\nin order to clarify that a practice need only be a single act or omission. This modification does\nnot substantively change the proposed definition, as we included in the proposed definition\nthat a “practice” could be one act or omission.\n\nWe have finalized the use of the term “practice,” rather than the term “activity,” to\ndescribe conduct that is likely to interfere with, prevent or materially discourage the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. We have also finalized our approach that when identifying\nexceptions, we describe practices that, if all the applicable conditions are met, are reasonable\nand necessary and not information blocking.\n\n\n",

We considered this allocation of proof to be a substantive\ncondition of the proposed exceptions. As a practical matter, we proposed that actors are in the\nbest position to demonstrate compliance with the conditions of the exceptions and to produce\nthe detailed evidence necessary to demonstrate that compliance. We requested comment about\nthe types of documentation and/or standardized methods that an actor may use to demonstrate\ncompliance with the exception conditions.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters requested clarification regarding the type and amount\nof documentation required to demonstrate that they have met an exception. In particular, many\ncommenters noted that meeting the exceptions will substantially increase documentation\nburden and other administrative costs for actors. Commenters also noted that organizations\nmay need to update, develop and/or implement policies and procedures focused on\ndocumenting compliance with information blocking exceptions. Many commenters requested\nthat ONC develop and provide examples, templates, and guidance on the type of\ndocumentation that would be acceptable to support the conditions for each information\nblocking exception. Several commenters noted that the supporting documentation should\n\n\n\n\nclearly demonstrate why the actor qualifies for the exception, why the exception is required,\nand how all conditions of the exception are fulfilled. One commenter asked that we provide\nguidance on the appropriate storage method for this documentation, as this information may\nnot be appropriate for the clinical record.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments and suggestions. We\nhave tailored the exceptions and provided significant detail within each exception to clearly\nexplain what an actor must do to meet each exception. For each exception, we have proposed\nand finalized conditions that we believe can be consistently applied across a range of actors\nand practices and also further the goals of the information blocking provision. For some\nexceptions, this includes a writing or documentation requirement to demonstrate that the\npractice precisely meets all of the conditions to afford an actor the enhanced assurance an\nexception offers. Many of these conditions are related to other existing regulatory\nrequirements that have similar documentation standards. For example, an actor’s practice may\nmeet the Security Exception at § 171.203 if it is consistent with an organizational security\npolicy and that policy meets several requirements. We expect that many actors have existing\norganizational security policies based on the “Policy and procedures and documentation\nrequirements” in the HIPAA Security Rule at 45 CFR 164.316. Consequently, the burden\nassociated with meeting the documentation requirement in the Security Exception should be\nless if actors are already complying with the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\nWe encourage actors to voluntarily comply with an exception so that their practices do\nnot meet the definition of information blocking and are not subject to information blocking\nenforcement. However, failure to meet an exception does not necessarily mean a practice\nmeets the definition of information blocking. If subject to an investigation, each practice that\nimplicates the information blocking provision and does not meet an exception would be\n\n\n\n\nanalyzed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate, for example, whether it rises to the level of an\ninterference, and whether the actor acted with the requisite intent.\n\n\n",

              "text": "We proposed to establish seven exceptions to the information blocking provision. The\nexceptions would apply to certain practices that may technically meet the definition of\ninformation blocking but that are reasonable and necessary to further the underlying public\npolicies of the information blocking provision. We appreciate that most actors will want to\nmeet an exception to guarantee that their practice or practices do not meet the definition of\ninformation blocking and be subject to enforcement. The statute defines information blocking\nbroadly and in a manner that allows for careful consideration of relevant facts and\ncircumstances in individual cases, which includes analysis of an actor’s intent and whether it\nmeets the requisite knowledge standard.\n\nThe proposed exceptions were based on three related policy considerations. First, each\nexception was limited to certain activities that clearly advance the aims of the information\nblocking provision. These reasonable and necessary activities included providing appropriate\nprotections to prevent harm to patients and others; promoting the privacy and security of EHI;\npromoting competition and innovation in health IT and its use to provide health care services\nto consumers, and to develop more efficient means of health care delivery; and allowing\nsystem downtime to implement upgrades, repairs, and other changes to health IT. Second,\neach proposed exception addressed a significant risk that regulated actors will not engage in\nthese beneficial activities because of uncertainty concerning the breadth or applicability of the\ninformation blocking provision. Finally, each exception was subject to strict conditions to\nensure that it was limited to activities that are reasonable and necessary.\n\nWe explained that the first three exceptions extended to certain activities that are\n\n\n\n\nreasonable and necessary to prevent harm to patients and others; promote the privacy of EHI;\nand promote the security of EHI, subject to strict conditions to prevent the exceptions from\nbeing misused. We discussed that without these exceptions, actors may be reluctant to engage\nin the reasonable and necessary activities and that this could erode trust in the health IT\necosystem and undermine efforts to provide access and facilitate the exchange and use of EHI\nfor important purposes. We stressed that such a result would be contrary to the purpose of the\ninformation blocking provision and the broader policies of the Cures Act.\n\nWe explained that the next three exceptions addressed activities that are reasonable\nand necessary to promote competition and consumer welfare. First, we proposed to permit the\nrecovery of certain types of reasonable costs incurred to provide technology and services that\nenable access to EHI and facilitate the exchange and use of that information, provided certain\nconditions are met. Second, we proposed to permit an actor to decline to provide access,\nexchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is infeasible, subject to a duty to provide a\nreasonable alternative. And third, we proposed an exception that would permit an actor to\nlicense interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. We emphasized\nthat the exceptions would be subject to strict conditions to ensure that they do not extend\nprotection to practices that raise information blocking concerns.\n\nThe last exception recognized that it may be reasonable and necessary for actors to\nmake health IT temporarily unavailable for the benefit of the overall performance of health IT.\n\nThis exception would permit an actor to make the operation of health IT unavailable to\nimplement upgrades, repairs, and other changes.\n\nAs context for the proposed exceptions, we noted that addressing information blocking\nis critical for promoting competition and innovation in health IT and for the delivery of health\ncare services to consumers. We noted that the information blocking provision itself expressly\n\n\n\n\naddresses practices that impede innovation and advancement in health information access,\nexchange, and use, including care delivery enabled by health IT (section 3022(a)(2)(C)(ii) of\nthe PHSA). We also noted that health IT developers of certified health IT, HIEs, HINs, and, in\nsome instances, health care providers, may exploit their control over interoperability elements\nto create barriers to entry for competing technologies and services that offer greater value for\nhealth IT customers and users, provide new or improved capabilities, and enable more robust\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI.133\nMore than this, we emphasized that information blocking\nmay harm competition not just in health IT markets, but also in markets for health care\nservices.134\nDominant providers in these markets may leverage their control over technology\nto limit patient mobility and choice.135\nThey may also pressure independent providers to adopt\nexpensive, hospital-centric technologies that do not suit their workflows, limit their ability to\nshare information with unaffiliated providers, and make it difficult to adopt or use alternative\ntechnologies that could offer greater efficiency and other benefits.136\nThe technological\ndependence resulting from these practices can be a barrier to entry by would-be competitors. It\ncan also make independent providers vulnerable to acquisition or induce them into exclusive\narrangements that enhance the market power of incumbent providers while preventing the\nformation of clinically-integrated products and networks that offer more choice and better\nvalue to consumers and purchasers of health care services.\n\n133\nSee also Martin Gaynor, Farzad Mostashari, and Paul B.

We expressed appreciation for the expertise and informal technical\nassistance of FTC staff, which we took into consideration in developing the exceptions for\nrecovering costs reasonably incurred, responding to requests that are infeasible, and licensing\nof interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. We noted that the\nlanguage in the Cures Act regarding information blocking is substantively and substantially\ndifferent from the language and goals in the antitrust laws enforced by the FTC. We explained\nthat we view the Cures Act as addressing conduct that may be considered permissible under\nthe antitrust laws. On this basis, the Proposed Rule required that actors who control\ninteroperability elements cooperate with individuals and entities that require those elements\nfor the purpose of developing, disseminating, and enabling technologies and services that can\ninteroperate with the actor’s technology.\n\nWe emphasized that ONC took this approach because we view patients as having an\noverwhelming interest in EHI about themselves. As such, access to EHI, and the EHI itself,\nshould not be traded or sold by those actors who are custodians of EHI or who control its\naccess, exchange, or use. We emphasized that such actors should not be able to charge fees for\nproviding electronic access, exchange, or use of patients’ EHI. We explained that the\ninformation blocking provision prohibits actors from interfering with the access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI unless they are required to do so under an existing law or are covered by one of the\nexceptions detailed in this preamble. In addition, we explained that any remedy sought or\naction taken by HHS under the information blocking provision would be independent of the\nantitrust laws and would not prevent FTC or DOJ from taking action with regard to the same\n\n\n\n\nactor or conduct.\n\nWe proposed to include a provision in § 171.200 that addresses the availability and\neffect of exceptions.\n\nWe requested comment on the seven proposed exceptions, including whether they will\nachieve our stated policy goals.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments regarding each of the proposed exceptions.\n\n*Response.* We have responded to the comments regarding each exception in the\npreamble discussions for each exception. Overall, we have made modifications to the structure\nand scope of the proposed exceptions.\n\nIn this final rule, we have restructured the proposed exceptions (proposed in §§\n171.201-207) and have added another exception for clarity. In addition, we have divided the\nexceptions into two categories: (1) exceptions that involve not fulfilling requests to access,\nexchange, or use EHI, which are finalized in §§ 171.201-205; and (2) exceptions that involve\nprocedures for fulfilling requests to access, exchange, or use EHI, which are finalized in §§\n171.301-303. We also changed the titles of the exceptions to questions for additional clarity.\n\nWe believe this new structure will help actors better understand our expectations of them and\nenhance transparency around the exceptions.\n\nWe note that we use the term “fulfill” throughout the exceptions in the context of an\nactor “fulfilling” a request to access, exchange, or use EHI. This term is intended to reflect not\njust a response to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI, but also making the EHI available\nfor the requested access, exchange, or use.\n\nWe have finalized the seven exceptions with modifications discussed below. Based on\nrequests for comment we included in the Proposed Rule regarding the scope of the EHI\ndefinition (84 FR 7513) and the Infeasibility Exception (84 FR 7542 through 7544), we have\n\n\n\n\nalso established a new exception in § 171.301 (referred to as the Content and Manner\nException) under section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA as a means to identify reasonable and\nnecessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. We discuss the details of the\nnew Content and Manner Exception in section VIII.D.2.a of this preamble.\n\nWe appreciate the FTC’s comments on the Proposed Rule and the expertise and\ninformal technical assistance provided by FTC staff for this final rule, which we took into\nconsideration throughout our development of the final rule, including as it relates to the\ndefinitions of various terms in the final rule (e.g., the definitions of “electronic health\ninformation” and “health information network” (discussed above)) and the exceptions (e.g.,\nthe Infeasibility Exception, Fees Exception, and Licensing Exception; as well as the\nestablishing of the new Content and Manner Exception).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on the provision in § 171.200.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized § 171.200 as proposed and have included an identical\nprovision in § 171.300 that is applicable to Part C. This addition was necessary based on the\nnew structure of the exceptions discussed above.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed to establish an exception to the information blocking provision in §\n171.201 that would apply to certain practices that are reasonable and necessary to prevent\nharm to a patient or another person. As discussed in the Proposed Rule’s preamble (84 FR\n7523 and 7524), this exception is intended to allow for the protection of patients and other\nparticular persons against substantial risks of harm otherwise arising from the access,\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use of EHI in defined circumstances. Strict conditions were proposed to prevent\nthis exception from being misused.\n\nAs explained in the Proposed Rule, we use the term “patient” to denote the context in\nwhich the threat of harm arises (84 FR 7523). That is, this exception has been designed to\nrecognize practices taken for the benefit of recipients of health care — those individuals\nwhose EHI is at issue — and other persons whose information may be recorded in that EHI or\nwho may be at risk of harm because of the access, use, or exchange of the EHI. This use of the\nterm “patient” in the Proposed Rule did not imply that practices to which the exception is\napplicable could be implemented only by the licensed health professionals with a clinician-\npatient relationship to the person whose EHI is affected by the practices.\n\nThis exception was proposed to apply to practices when the actor engaging in a\npractice has a reasonable belief that the practice will directly and substantially reduce a risk of\nharm to the patient, and/or other particular individuals, that would otherwise arise from the\nparticular access, exchange, or use of EHI affected by the practices. We proposed that actors\nincluding but not limited to health care providers would, consistent with conditions of the\nexception applicable to the circumstances in which the practices are used, be able to engage in\npractices recognized under this exception without the actor needing to have a clinician-patient\nrelationship with any of the individuals at risk of harm.\n\n*Comments.* Of more than ninety comment submissions specifically referencing the\nPreventing Harm Exception, half expressed overarching or general support for the exception.\n\nNone of the comments specifically referencing this exception expressed opposition to the\nexception. Some commenters advocated broadening certain aspects of the proposed exception,\nas discussed in more detail below. Several other commenters expressed support for a relatively\nnarrow exception, and a few of these commenters recommended that once the final rule is\n\n\n\n\neffective ONC should engage in monitoring to ensure the exception is not abused in practice.\n\nMany commenters requested clarification on specific points, or expressed concerns or\nsuggested modifications to particular aspects of the exception, as will be discussed in more\ndetail below.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the many thoughtful comments on the value of this\nexception, particular aspects of the proposed exception, and areas where we could streamline\nhow we express the policy so it is easier to understand. Considering all of the comments\nreceived, we have decided to finalize the exception largely as proposed, with modifications to\nbetter align with HIPAA Rules as discussed below and to make the regulation text more easily\nunderstood. These revisions include modification of the title of § 171.201, from “Exception—\nPreventing Harm” (84 FR 7602) to “Preventing Harm Exception — When will an actor’s\npractice that is likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of electronic health\ninformation in order to prevent harm not be considered information blocking?” Throughout\nthis preamble, we use “Preventing Harm Exception” as a short title for ease of reference to the\nexception that has been finalized in § 171.201.\n\n*Comments.* Several comments suggested broadening the scope of the exception to\nallow a broader array of actors to decide what might pose a risk of harm to a patient.\n\n*Response.* The finalized exception is, as we proposed it would be, available to any\nactor defined in § 171.102, provided that the actor’s use of a practice for purposes of harm\nprevention meets the conditions in § 171.201. Only where practices are applied to a specific\npatient’s EHI and based upon a determination of a risk of harm by a licensed health care\nprofessional in the exercise of professional judgment does this exception explicitly require the\ndetermination to have been made by a particular subset of actors within the definitions in §\n171.102. In order to meet the risk of harm condition based on an individualized determination\n\n\n\n\nconsistent with § 171.201(c)(1), the licensed health care professional who made the\ndetermination must have done so in context of a current or prior clinician-patient relationship\nwith the patient whose EHI is affected by the determination.137\nHowever, other actors — such\nas other health care providers treating the same patient, or an HIE/HIN supporting access,\nexchange, or use of the patient’s EHI — could rely on such a determination of a risk of harm.\n\nThe actor’s knowledge of a licensed health care professional’s individualized determination\n(consistent with § 171.201(c)(1)) that access, exchange, or use posed a risk of a harm of a type\nconsistent with § 171.201(d)(1), (2), or (3) (as applicable) could factor into a determination\nbased on facts and circumstances known or reasonably believed by the actor (consistent with\nthe condition finalized § 171.201(f)(2)).\n\nAn actor could also implement practices based on knowledge of an individualized\ndetermination of risk (§ 171.201(c)(1)) of harm of a type consistent with § 171.201(d)(1), (2),\nor (3) as applicable and based on an organizational policy (consistent with the condition\nfinalized § 171.201(f)(1)). Thus, the exception is broad enough to cover all actors\nimplementing practices that meet its conditions. We are finalizing this aspect of the exception\nas proposed, with clarifications to the regulation text to make it easier to understand what the\nspecific conditions of the Preventing Harm Exception are and how they relate to one another.\n\n*Comments.* A large number of commenters requested additional guidance in this final\nrule preamble or through other avenues. For example, some commenters requested sub-\nregulatory guidance and educational resource materials to further illustrate and help actors\n137\nFor purposes of this exception, we interpret “clinician-patient relationship” to include any therapeutic or\nrelationship where the licensed health care professional has or at some point had some clinical responsibility for or\nto the patient within the professional’s scope of practice. Thus, a clinician-patient relationship on which a qualifying\nindividualized determination of risk of harm could be one of substantial duration over time or formed in the course\nof the first or only occasion on which the clinician furnishes or furnished professional services to the patient in any\nsetting, including but not limited to telehealth.\n\n\n\n\nunderstand how the Preventing Harm Exception might apply or what it might require without\na stakeholder needing to raise particular questions or hypothetical fact patterns.\n\n*Response.* With the revisions we have made to this exception, we do not believe sub-\nregulatory guidance is necessary for actors who wish to avail themselves of this exception to\nunderstand the Preventing Harm Exception, its conditions, or to conform their practices to the\nconditions. We have made revisions to the regulation text to provide enhanced clarity, such as\nseparately expressing each of its substantive conditions and incorporating granular alignment\nto 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3) harm standards. This final rule preamble provides additional\ninformation and feedback through discussion of the particular questions and suggestions posed\nby various commenters and this preamble’s statements of finalized policy. We will also\nprovide, in connection to this final rule, educational resources such as infographics, fact\nsheets, webinars, and other forms of educational materials and outreach. We emphasize,\nhowever, that we believe the final rule clearly describes our information blocking policies, and\nthese educational materials are intended only to educate stakeholders on our final policies\nestablished in the final rule.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters questioned whether “directly and substantially” may\nbe a more stringent standard than is necessary for the reduction of risk of harm to a patient or\nto another person. A number of commenters indicated it could be difficult for actors to know\nwhere to draw the line between direct and indirect reductions of risk of harm, given the\npotential for reasonable minds to disagree on the extent to which a risk arises directly, as\nopposed to indirectly, from the EHI access, exchange, or use affected by a practice. Several\ncommenters recommended, as an alternative, that the condition be that the actor have a\nreasonable belief the practice is “reasonably likely” to reduce a risk of harm.\n\n*Response.* After considering comments received, we have finalized in § 171.201(a)\n\n\n\n\nthat the actor must hold a reasonable belief that the practice “will substantially reduce” a risk\nof harm to a patient or another natural person. In comparison to the regulation text of this\nexception in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7602), we have removed “directly” from the finalized\ntext of § 171.201(a). We believe omitting “directly” from the finalized condition obviates\nconcerns about actors’ ability to determine whether the practice directly reduces a risk of harm\nthat could itself arise indirectly. We have retained “substantially” in the finalized § 171.201(a)\nbecause we believe it is necessary to ensure this exception cannot be misused to justify\npractices that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI to achieve only a trivial or\nillusory reduction in risk of harm. By extension, we interpret a “substantial reduction” as\nnecessarily implying that the risk intended to be reduced was itself substantial and not trivial\nor illusory.\n\nWe note that the harm standard under § 164.524(a)(3) of the HIPAA Rules includes\nthat the access requested be “reasonably likely” to cause the type of harm described in the sub-\nparagraph applicable to a particular denial of access under § 164.524(a)(3). As discussed in\ncontext of the finalized type of harm condition (§ 171.201(d)), below, we have aligned the\nconditions of the Preventing Harm Exception finalized in § 171.201 to use the same harm\nstandards as § 164.524(a)(3) in circumstances where both apply and in circumstances where\nonly § 171.201 applies. In order to maintain alignment and consistency, we clarify that in\ncircumstances where only § 171.201 applies, the risk of harm must also initially be at least\n“reasonably likely,” regardless of whether the risk of harm is consistent with subparagraph (1)\nor (2) of the type of risk condition finalized in § 171.201(c). To satisfy the reasonable belief\ncondition finalized in § 171.201(a), the actor must reasonably believe their practices (that are\nlikely to, or in fact do, interfere with otherwise permissible access, exchange, or use of EHI)\nwill substantially reduce that likelihood of harm. Actors who are HIPAA covered entities or\n\n\n\n\nbusiness associates have extensive experience in complying with § 164.524(a)(3). Therefore,\nwe believe the belief standard finalized in § 171.201(a), combined with reliance on the harm\nstandards used in § 164.524(a)(3), will address commenters’ concerns about their ability to\nunderstand and apply the reasonable belief and type of harm conditions finalized under\n§ 171.201.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters advocated closer alignment with the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule. Some commenters expressed concerns about our ability to maintain such\nalignment without interruption if this rule were to be finalized prior to any applicable potential\nupdates to the HIPAA Privacy Rule pursuant to a proposed rule that HHS had publicly\nexpressed an aim to publish in 2019. Some commenters specifically questioned whether “life\nor physical safety” would remain the standard for the type of harm cognizable under the\nPrivacy Rule for denying an individual’s right to access their own information. One\ncommenter stated they had heard the Privacy Rule harm standard might be broadened to\nrecognize additional types of harm, such as emotional or psychological harm, in circumstances\nwhere the Privacy Rule would currently recognize only danger to life or physical safety. A\nnumber of comments stated that the requirement for the risk to be to life or physical safety for\nall circumstances where this exception would apply would conflict with current Privacy Rule\nprovisions applicable to individual or proxy access to PHI. A number of commenters\nrecommended we revise the conditions for practices to be recognized under the Preventing\nHarm Exception so that harm cognizable under the Privacy Rule under particular\ncircumstances would also be cognizable under § 171.201.\n\n*Response.* We understand commenters’ concerns about inconsistency across this\nexception and the Privacy Rule. In particular, concerns that center on the fact that requiring in\n§ 171.201 that the risk must be to the “life or physical safety” of the patient or another person\n\n\n\n\nin all circumstances where § 171.201 applies would have set a different harm standard than\napplies under § 164.524(a)(3) in particular circumstances where both §§ 171.201 and\n164.524(a)(3) apply. Specifically, where § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) apply, the reviewable\ngrounds for denial of right of access include where a licensed health care professional has\ndetermined, in the exercise of professional judgment, that the access requested is likely to\ncause “substantial harm.” In contrast, a uniform application of the “life or physical safety”\ntype of harm under § 171.201 would have applied the “life or physical safety” type of harm\nstandard to practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for purposes of §\n171.201 even where § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) would also apply and where § 164.524(a)(3)(ii)\nor (iii) would apply the “substantial harm” standard.\n\nIn response to comments, we have reviewed the potential for conflict between §\n171.201 requiring “life or physical safety” as the type of harm in circumstances where §\n164.524(a)(3(ii) or (iii) also apply. We have determined that for particular types of\ncircumstances where both §§ 171.201 and 164.524(a)(3) apply, the best approach is to apply\nunder § 171.201 the exact same harm standard that each specific sub-paragraph of §\n164.524(a)(3) applies in each of these types of circumstances. We believe that extending the\napplication under § 171.201 of the specific harm standards in § 164.524(a)(3)(i) through (iii)\nto situations that are similar in significant respects to situations where each of these sub-\nparagraphs of § 165.524(a)(3) would apply, but where § 164.524(a)(3) does not apply,\nprovides consistency that simplifies compliance for actors subject to both 45 CFR part 171\nand 45 CFR part 164. Situations where § 171.201 could apply but where § 164.524(a)(3)\nwould not apply include, but are not limited to, those where the actor’s practice is likely to\ninterfere with an individual or their legal representative’s access, exchange, or use of the\nindividual’s EHI but not to the extent of failing to provide access (as the term is used in\n\n\n\n\ncontext of § 164.524) within the timeframe allowed under § 164.524.\n\nTo make the alignment between the Preventing Harm Exception and the Privacy Rule\nclear, the final regulation text at § 171.201(d) cross-references the specific types of harm that\nwould serve as grounds for denying an individual or their personal representative access to\ntheir PHI under the Privacy Rule (§ 164.524(a)(3)) in particular types of circumstances.138\nBy\ncross-referencing to § 164.524(a)(3), we align the regulations to streamline compliance for\nactors. We also believe this approach will allow that alignment to remain in place if changes\nwere to be made to § 164.524(a)(3) harm standards in the future.139\nIn particular types of\ncircumstances where both § 164.524(a)(3) and § 171.201 apply, the subparagraphs of finalized\n§ 171.201(d) (the type of harm condition) cross-reference to the § 164.524(a)(3)(i), (ii), and\n(iii) harm standard that applies under § 171.201 in each of these types of circumstances.\n\nMoreover, where only § 171.201 applies to a practice where the type of risk is consistent with\n§ 171.201(c)(1), the finalized subparagraphs of § 171.201(d) cross-reference and apply the\nharm standard that § 164.524(a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) would apply to denial of the individual’s (§\n164.524) right of access to their own PHI, the individual or their representative’s access to the\nPII of another person within that PHI, or the individual’s personal representative’s access to\nthe individual’s PHI.\n\nOne example of a particular circumstance in which both § 164.524(a)(3) and § 171.201\nwould apply is where a health care provider (as defined in § 171.102) that is also a HIPAA\ncovered entity (as defined in § 160.103) denies the patient’s personal representative access to\n138\nMeeting the harm standard is necessary but not alone sufficient for a practice to be recognized as reasonable and\nnecessary under this exception; all other conditions of the exception must also be met.\n\n139\nAlignment between part 171 subpart B and § 164.524(a)(1) and (2) is discussed in Section VIII.D.2. We also\nacknowledge that it is possible some types of revision to 45 CFR part 164 could necessitate modifications to 45 CFR\npart 171 in the future.\n\n\n\n\nthe patient’s EHI based on a licensed health care professional’s determination in the exercise\nof professional judgment (§ 171.201(c)(1)) that granting that personal representative access to\nthe patient’s EHI would pose a risk of substantial harm to the patient.140\nIn this circumstance,\nthe finalized § 171.201(d)(1), which cross-references the harm standard applicable under §\n165.524(a)(3)(iii), applies. In this example situation, the qualifying determination of risk of\nharm (§ 171.201(c)(1)) is that any access (or exchange, or use) of the EHI by the personal\nrepresentative is reasonably likely to cause harm consistent with the standard established in §\n164.524(a)(3)(iii), and thus the health care professional, or another HIPAA covered entity or\nbusiness associate with knowledge of the determination, could also deny a request by the\nrepresentative to access the individual’s ePHI under § 164.524(a)(iii).\n\nUnder § 164.524(a)(iii), the harm must be a “substantial harm” to qualify for the denial\nof the patient’s personal representative’s request to access the patient’s PHI. Similarly, both §\n171.201 and § 164.524(a)(3) apply where an information blocking actor that is also a HIPAA\ncovered entity, acting in reliance on a determination of risk of harm made by a licensed health\ncare professional in the exercise of professional judgment, does not provide the patient or the\npatient’s personal representative any access to information within the patient’s EHI that\nreferences another person. In this type of circumstance, § 171.201(d)(2) by cross-reference to\n§ 164.524(a)(3)(ii) applies the same “substantial harm” standard under § 171.201 that applies\nto the actor’s denying the patient or their representative access to that information under §\n164.524(a)(3)(ii).141\n140\nFor purposes of how the § 171.201 requirements and cross-references to § 164.524 operate within this example, it\nmakes no difference whether the health care provider acting on the individualized determination is the licensed\nhealth care professional who made the determination consistent with § 171.201(c)(1), another licensed health care\nprofessional, or another type of health care provider (such as a hospital or skilled nursing facility).\n\n141\nNote that the “individual” and “access” have different meanings under 45 CFR 164.524 from those in 45 CFR\npart 171. Regarding an individual’s right of access under 45 CFR 164.524, the term “access” should be understood\n\n\n\n\nIn § 171.201(d)(1), (2), and (3), as finalized, we also apply the harm standards\ndescribed in § 164.524(a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) to particular types of circumstances where §\n164.524 does not apply, but that are similar with respect to whether it is the patient or their\nrepresentative requesting access, and whether the access requested is to information within the\npatient’s EHI that is another person’s identifiable information. For example, § 171.201(d)(3)\napplies the harm standard described in § 164.524(a)(3)(i) where practices that are likely to\ninterfere with a patient’s access, exchange, or use142\nof the patient’s own EHI are implemented\nto substantially reduce a risk of harm arising from data that is known or reasonably suspected\nto be misidentified or mismatched, corrupt due to technical failure, or erroneous for another\nreason (§ 171.201(c)(2)). Provided its conditions are met in full, the Preventing Harm\nException (§ 171.201) would apply to such practices as delaying access, exchange, or use, for\nthe time necessary to correct the errors that would otherwise pose a risk of harm to the patient\n(or another person) that would be cognizable under § 164.524(a)(3)(i) if § 164.524(a)(3)(i)\napplied.143\nSuch delays are not explicitly addressed under § 164.524(a)(3), which provides a\nmaximum timeframe for disclosure of PHI to which patients have the right of access, and §\n164.524(a)(3) does not expressly contemplate risks of harm arising from data issues as would\nbe consistent with § 171.201(c)(2). By contrast, § 171.201 defines when a practice that is\nlikely to, or does, interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI is excepted from the\ndefinition of information blocking in § 171.103 that applies to the actor engaged in the\npractice, and expressly applies where the actor can demonstrate a reasonable belief the\npractice will substantially reduce a risk of harm arising from data issues consistent with §\nin that HIPAA Privacy Rule context.\n\n142\nAs the terms “access,” “exchange,” and “use” are defined in § 171.102.\n\n143\nNote, again, that “access” has a different meaning in subpart E of 45 CFR part 164 than it does in 45 CFR part\n171.\n\n\n\n\n171.201(c)(2).\n\nBecause risks of harm arising from data that is known or reasonably suspected to be\nmisidentified or mismatched, corrupt due to technical failure, or erroneous for another reason\n(§ 171.201(c)(2)) would apply equally to an individual’s or their representative’s or their\nhealth care provider’s access, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI, § 171.201(d)(4) applies\nthe standard in § 164.524(a)(3)(i) to all of these circumstances. Thus, as § 164.524(a)(3)(i)\nstands at the time of publication of this final rule, the access, exchange, or use of the EHI\naffected by the practice must be reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the\npatient or another person were the practice not implemented. (Please see Table 3 for a\ncrosswalk of the particular types of circumstances addressed by the subparagraphs under §\n171.201(d) to the § 164.524 harm standard applicable to each type of circumstance.)\nThe finalized regulatory text in § 171.201 is revised from the Proposed Rule to reflect\nthis more granular and comprehensive alignment of harm standards across the two regulatory\nprovisions. We believe this alignment achieves the level of granular cross-reference necessary\nand that is preferable to selecting only one of these standards to apply in all types of\ncircumstances under § 171.201. We further note that the revised regulation text is consistent\nwith our decision to completely align the EHI definition with the definition of ePHI within the\ndesignated record set.144\nComments. A number of commenters advocated for expanding the definition of harm\nthat is contemplated under this exception to encompass psychological and/or emotional harm\nin addition to risks to life or physical safety, including but not limited to expanding the\nconcept of individualized determinations of risk of harm by health care professionals. A few\n144\nSee section VIII.C.3 of this preamble and the finalized definition of “electronic health information” in § 171.102.\n\n\n\n\ncommenters specifically advocated recognizing the potential for financial, reputational, or\nsocial/cultural harms. A number of other commenters expressed a concern that broadening the\nexception to address additional types of potential harm could risk its being overused to\nwithhold information from patients where available evidence does not indicate there is a risk.\n\nOne commenter reported having observed that some clinicians express a belief that mere\ndisclosure of health data directly to patients without the clinician’s professional interpretation\nwill routinely cause harm, despite what the commenter described as existing evidence to the\ncontrary.\n\n*Response.* We believe it would be challenging to define an appropriate and unique\nstandard for purposes of this exception for non-physical harms that all actors defined in §\n171.102 could apply consistently and, most importantly, without unduly restricting patients’\nrights to access their health information. We also recognize, as discussed above, the practical\nutility of alignment with relevant Privacy Rule provisions. At this time, only danger to the\nindividual’s “life or physical safety” is recognized as grounds for denial of an individual’s\nright of access under § 164.524(a)(3)(i). However, “substantial harm” is the standard applied\nunder the Privacy Rule where the access denied is to information identifying another person\n(other than a health care provider) or where an individual’s personal representative is denied\naccess to the individual’s PHI under § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii). To align with the relevant\nPrivacy Rule provisions, the final regulation text (§ 171.201(d)(1) and (2)) references the\nsame harm standards as the Privacy Rule uses where § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) as well as\n§ 171.201 applies, and in circumstances where § 164.524(a)(3) is not implicated but the\nactor’s practice is both based on an individualized determination of harm (consistent with\n§ 171.201(c)(1)) and likely to interfere with: (§ 171.201(d)(2)) a patient’s or their legal\nrepresentative’s access, exchange, or use of information within their EHI that identifies\n\n\n\n\nanother person (other than a health care provider); or (§ 171.201(d)(1)) the patient’s legal\nrepresentative’s access, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI. The finalized § 171.201(d)(3)\nand (4) also re-use the familiar § 164.524(a)(3)(i) type of harm for the wide variety of\ncircumstances where § 171.201 applies but the type of risk is consistent with § 171.201(c)(2)\nor the (otherwise legally permissible) access, exchange, or use of EHI with which the practice\nis likely to interfere is by someone other than the patient or their legal representative. Thus,\nthe finalized § 171.201 does not establish a standard for non-physical harm that would be\nunique to the Preventing Harm Exception but instead recognizes “substantial harm” in\ncircumstances where § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) apply, and also applies this familiar type of\nharm in situations where neither § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) nor (iii) applies but where re-use of this\nsame standard under § 171.201 is consistent with the goal of aligning the types of harm\nrecognized under Preventing Harm Exception with the grounds for denying a right of access\nrequest under the Privacy Rule.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter specifically recommended allowing actors to rely on an\nindividual’s own subjective beliefs related to harm.\n\n*Response.* We interpret this comment as pertaining to the beliefs of the patient whose\nEHI would be affected by a practice. We appreciate this opportunity to explain that practices\nimplemented to honor and apply the patient’s expressed preferences regarding access,\nexchange, or use of their EHI are addressed by the Privacy Exception finalized in § 171.202.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters requested clarification of how the Preventing\nHarm Exception and its conditions might operate in situations involving minors where\napplicable State laws allow non-emancipated minors to independently consent to certain types\nof health care and provide for keeping records of such care confidential from the minor’s\nparents/guardians. Several of these commenters specifically requested clarification about the\n\n\n\n\noperation of this exception where State law provides for minors to be able to consent to some\nor all types of health care but does not provide for or allow the minors to access their health\nrecords information at all, or in specific format(s).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ offering us the opportunity to reiterate that\nwhere a particular access, exchange, or use of EHI is prohibited by applicable Federal, State,\nor tribal law, an exception to the definition of information blocking is not needed. Nothing in\npart 171 calls for access, exchange, use, or other disclosure of EHI that is prohibited by other\napplicable law. If an actor simply cannot effectively segment EHI they could safely and\npermissibly share from EHI they are not permitted to share in a given requested format, the\nactor should refer to the exception for requests that are infeasible (§ 171.204). However, if the\nEHI they could legally disclose could be shared in a different manner than that initially\nrequested but the different manner would support segmentation, then an actor should provide\nthe EHI they can safely and legally share in the most appropriate manner consistent with the\nContent and Manner Exception (§ 171.301).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters specifically requested clarification as to the\ninformation blocking implications where State law and/or the organization’s account\nprovisioning process do not provide for minors to obtain the login credentials needed to access\ntheir own records through an electronic portal, which will often be the login credentials a\npatient would use to authorize an app to receive the records through the provider’s API.\n\n*Response.* Where the actor does not have a reasonable belief that a practice interfering\nwith minors’ access to their own EHI will substantially reduce a risk of harm cognizable under\nthis exception, the Preventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201) would not apply. This exception\nwould also not apply where any person—whether adult, emancipated minor, or non-\nemancipated minor—is not able to provide adequate verification of their identity consistent\n\n\n\n\nwith the actor’s health information privacy or security protection policies. Actors should\nassess practices related to verifying the identity of a patient, or a legal representative of the\npatient, for consistency with the conditions of the Privacy Exception as finalized in § 171.202\nand/or the Security Exception as finalized in § 171.203. Likewise, practices implemented to\nconfirm a representative’s legal authority to access or request or authorize access, exchange,\nor use of a minor’s EHI on behalf of the minor, should be analyzed in the context of the\nPrivacy Exception as finalized in § 171.202 and/or the Security Exception as finalized in §\n171.203. Where otherwise applicable law prohibits a specific access, exchange, or use of\ninformation, an exception to part 171 is not necessary due to the exclusion of “required by\nlaw” practices from the statutory information blocking definition in section 3022 of the PHSA\n(as discussed in section VIII.C.1 of this preamble). However, where an actor simply lacks the\ntechnical capability to provide access, exchange, or use in a specific requested mechanism,\nformat, or manner, we would encourage the actor to review its practices for consistency with\nthe new Content and Manner Exception finalized in § 171.301 or the Infeasibility Exception\nfinalized in § 171.204.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification as to whether the Preventing\nHarm Exception would apply to 42 CFR part 2 data when it is not made available for access,\nexchange, or use because the patient did not consent to its access, exchange, or use.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to remedy any confusion that may have been\ncaused by the Proposed Rule’s use of an illustrative example (84 FR 7524) within which the\nrequirement to withhold data subject to 42 CFR part 2 regulations rendered a particular access,\nexchange, or use of only a portion of the patient’s EHI legally permissible. In the example,\nonly those portions of the patient’s EHI to which 42 CFR part 2 does not apply could be\npermissibly accessed, exchanged, or used. This example was intended only to illustrate that\n\n\n\n\nthe mere fact that an actor has knowledge, possession, custody, or control of more EHI than\nthe actor could legally share would not, itself, provide a basis for application of the Preventing\nHarm Exception to the actor’s withholding of any of the EHI that the actor could legally share.\n\nWhen an actor that is subject to 42 CFR part 2 cannot honor a request for access, exchange, or\nuse of data subject to 42 CFR part 2 specifically because the patient has not provided the\nconsent that would be required by 42 CFR part 2 before the actor could disclose that specific\ndata for access, exchange, or use, the Preventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201) would not\napply. When an actor has 42 CFR part 2 data for a patient but does not believe it has\ndocumented the patient consent that is legally required before the actor can fulfill a request for\naccess, exchange, or use of that data, the actor should refer instead to the Privacy Exception\nfinalized in § 171.202. If the actor lacks the technical capability to effectively segment data\nthat it can legally share from data that it cannot legally share, the actor should also consider\nthe new Content and Manner Exception finalized in § 171.301 or the Infeasibility Exception\nfinalized in § 171.204.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters noted that some State laws prohibit the release of\nspecific information, such as results of particular diagnostic tests, to patients through\nelectronic means (e.g., patient portals or APIs) until particular protocols have been completed.\n\nCommenters cited, as an example, State law mandates for initial communication of particular\ninformation to the patient by a health professional in real time. The commenters requested\nclarification of whether or how § 171.201 would apply in those circumstances.\n\n*Response.* As is the case with 42 CFR part 2 data that the patient has not consented to\ndisclose, the exception finalized in § 171.201 would not apply in these particular types of\ncircumstances. The information blocking definition proposed and finalized in § 171.103 does\nnot include a practice that is likely to, or in fact does, interfere with the access, exchange, or\n\n\n\n\nuse of EHI when the practice is required by law. If the actor lacks the technical capability to\nsegment data at the level of granularity needed to withhold only those data points, elements, or\nclasses that it is legally prohibited from disclosing in response to a particular request, the\nactor should consider the Content and Manner Exception finalized in § 171.301 or the\nInfeasibility Exception finalized in § 171.204.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that we recognize under § 171.201\npractices requiring patients to obtain their laboratory results information only through the\nordering provider’s EHR. Commenters stated that inaccurate display of such results is a safety\nrisk and that other actors such as laboratories and HINs/HIEs may not have the technical\ncapability to display the information accurately in a human-readable interface that would be in\nfull compliance with regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to human-readable displays\nof laboratory results information.\n\n*Response.* We agree that display of inaccurate values for laboratory results, or other\nclinical observations, could represent a safety risk. We do not believe it would be appropriate\nto broadly limit patients to obtaining their laboratory information only from providers that are\n(or that employ) professionals whose scope of practice allows them to order the tests. If a\nlaboratory, or a HIN/HIE, has the data in an interoperable format to support its exchange\nacross providers, but does not have the technical capability to appropriately display it for\nhuman readability (such as in a patient portal), then the laboratory, or HIN/HIE, should make\nthe data available in the interoperable format to providers or patients who can then view the\ndata using technology the provider or patient has chosen as appropriate to their needs. If any\nactor receives a request for data access, exchange, or use via a specific mechanism that the\nactor does not have the technical capability to support, the actor should consider the Content\nand Manner Exception finalized in § 171.301 or the Infeasibility Exception finalized in §\n\n\n\n\n171.204.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested recognizing a new exception under the\nPreventing Harm Exception that would allow a health care provider who is also a research\ninstitution to require, as a condition of making EHI available for use in research, that the\nhealth care provider be a collaborator in that research. The commenter stated that institutions\nensure accuracy in the way data is used and analyzed by requiring they participate in any\nresearch involving their patients’ information so that they can explain for the research team\nany anomalies or other characteristics unique to their own institutions’ data and collection\nmethods. This commenter stated that disclosing EHI for research purposes when the research\nbeing conducted does not involve the health care provider disclosing the EHI could lead to\nmisinterpreted outcomes based on flawed data that could have a negative impact on scientific\ndiscovery.\n\n*Response.* We considered this suggested expansion of the Preventing Harm Exception\nspecifically in the context of the definition of “electronic health information” that we\nproposed, and the more focused definition of “electronic health information” that we have\nfinalized.145\nThe Preventing Harm Exception is intended to apply to practices an actor\nreasonably believes will substantially reduce a risk of harm (of a type cognizable under this\nexception) to particular person(s), such as a patient or a natural person in the patient’s life or\nmultiple patients whose EHI was corrupted or mismatched due to a technical failure of an\nactor’s systems. The risk of potential harm described by the comment was specifically of\nmisinterpretations of EHI leading to research findings that negatively impact scientific\ndiscovery. This risk is too far removed from a reasonable, and reasonably foreseeable,\n145\nWe note that, although various types of research data and data sets may be or include “electronic health\ninformation” as defined in § 171.102, not all research data or data sets are or include data meeting this definition.\n\n\n\n\nlikelihood of cognizable harm to particular patients or other particular natural persons to fit\nwithin the intent of the Preventing Harm Exception finalized in § 171.201. Therefore, we did\nnot modify the exception in response to this comment.\n\nFinalized belief and harm conditions for § 171.201.\n\nHaving considered comments received on the belief and harm standards, we have\nfinalized the exception at § 171.201 with modification, as discussed in responses to comments.\n\nThese modifications simplify the belief standard, and more thoroughly and specifically align\nthe harm standard applicable for this exception with either the Privacy Rule harm standard\napplicable under § 164.524(a)(3)(i) (in most circumstances) or the harm standard in\n§164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) (in particular circumstances). The harm standard in\n§164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) applies where both §§ 171.201 and 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) would\napply, or in particular circumstances that are sufficiently similar as to be analogous to\ncircumstances where both §§ 171.201 and 164.524(a)(3)(ii) or (iii) would apply.146\nPlease\nreference the finalized § 171.201(a) for the regulatory text of the belief standard. Please\nreference the finalized §§ 171.201(d)(1)-(3) for regulatory text that establishes the specific §\n164.524(a)(3) harm standard that applies in each of the three particular types of circumstances\nspecific to patients and their representatives’ access to the patient’s EHI, and reference §\n171.201(d)(4) for regulatory text establishing the specific § 164.524(a)(3) harm standard\napplicable in all other types of circumstances where § 171.201 applies.\n\nThe circumstances where both §§ 171.201 and 164.524(a)(3) would apply are where\nthe practices do interfere with access, exchange, or use by the patient or their legal\n146\nPlease note that the Preventing Harm Exception will not normally apply where a patient or their representative\nmay seek access to EHI that is excluded from the right of access under § 164.524(a)(1) or to which access may be\ndenied on unreviewable grounds under § 164.524(a)(2). In circumstances where § 171.201 conditions are not met\nbut an actor wishes to withhold EHI from an individual’s right of access under § 164.524(a)(1) or (2), the actor\nshould refer to the privacy exception (§ 171.202).\n\n\n\n\nrepresentative (who is their personal representative for purposes of § 164.524) of some or all\nof the patient’s EHI to the point of denying access (as used in context of § 164.524) on\ngrounds of a risk of harm determined on an individualized basis by a licensed health care\nprofessional in the exercise of professional judgment (§ 171.201(c)(1) as finalized).\n\nCircumstances where § 164.524(a)(3) is not implicated but that are analogous to\ncircumstances where both §§ 164.524(a)(3) and 171.201 apply are those where the risk of\nharm is determined on an individualized basis consistent with finalized § 171.201(c)(1) and\nthe practice does not entirely deny but is likely to, or does, interfere with the patient’s or their\nlegal representative’s access, exchange, or use of the EHI that is otherwise legally permissible.\n\n(For example, the practice may result in delaying access, exchange, or use of the EHI but for\nless time than is permitted for granting of a right of access request under § 164.524.)\nIn a wide variety of circumstances where § 171.201 will apply, § 164.524 would not\napply. Such circumstances include those where the access, exchange, or use of EHI with\nwhich the practice is likely to, or does, interfere is not related to right of access under the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule, such as access, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI by the patient’s\nhealth care providers. Likewise, § 171.201 will apply but § 164.524(a)(3) will not apply when\nthe risk of harm arises from data issues (§ 171.201(c)(2)) rather than having been determined\non an individualized basis by a licensed health care professional (§ 171.201(c)(1)). In these\ncircumstances where § 164.524 would not apply, and that are not analogous to circumstances\nwhere §164.524(a)(3) would apply, § 171.201(d)(4) (type of harm condition) applies the harm\nstandard that would be cognizable under § 164.524(a)(3)(i) so that the actor must reasonably\nbelieve the practice will reduce a risk otherwise posed to the life or physical safety of the\n\n\n\n\npatient or another natural person.147\nThis provides, under § 171.201, consistency across this\nwide array of circumstances where § 164.524(a)(3) would not be implicated regardless of the\nextent of interference or length of delay the practice may pose to the access, exchange, or use\nof the EHI. Because the circumstances to which the finalized § 171.201(d)(4) applies include\naccess, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI by health care providers furnishing services to\nthe patient, we believe it is most appropriate to apply under § 171.201(d)(4) the same standard\nof harm that would apply to denying a patient access to the patient’s EHI. This is consistent\nwith our proposal (84 FR 7602) to require that practices likely to interfere with any access,\nuse, or exchange of EHI would need to reduce a risk to the “life or physical safety” of a\npatient or another person to satisfy the conditions in § 171.201 and be excepted from the\ndefinition of information blocking in § 171.103. We have also clarified the regulation text so it\nis expressly clear on its face that the risk to be reduced must be one that would otherwise arise\nfrom the specific access, use, or exchange of EHI affected by the practice.\n\nUnder § 164.524(a)(3)(i), a covered entity may deny an individual access to protected\nhealth information (PHI) about that individual in a designated record set only if a licensed\nhealth care professional in the exercise of professional judgment determines that releasing the\ninformation to them would endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or another\nperson. Under § 171.201(d)(3), an actor148\nmay implement a practice that is likely to, or does,\ninterfere with the patient’s access, exchange, or use of their own EHI when the actor\nreasonably believes the practice will substantially reduce a risk of harm to life or physical\n147\nPlease note that although “individual” as defined in 45 CFR 169.103 is not limited to natural persons, the belief\nstandard in the finalized § 171.201 is, consistent with the requirement that in most circumstances the risk of harm at\nissue must be to life or physical safety.\n\n148\nAn actor could be any individual or entity meeting the definition of “health care provider,” “health IT developer\nof certified health IT” or “health information network or health information exchange” in § 171.102, and may or\nmay not also be a HIPAA covered entity or business associate as defined in the HIPAA Rules.\n\n\n\n\nsafety of the patient or another person, regardless of whether that risk is determined on an\nindividualized basis (§ 171.201(c)(1)) or arises from data that is known or reasonably\nsuspected to be corrupt due to technical failure, erroneous for another reason, or misidentified\nor mismatched (§ 171.201(c)(2)).\n\nUnder § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) and (iii), the standard of “substantial harm” applies where\nthe individual or their representative are denied access to information in the individual’s\nrecord that identifies another person (other than a health care provider), or an individual’s\npersonal representative is denied access to the individual’s information. Thus, the type of\nharm standard applicable under § 171.201 will in most cases require that the actor’s practice\nbe based on a reasonable belief that the requested access, exchange, or use with which the\npractice is likely to or does interfere would otherwise endanger the “life or physical safety” of\nthe patient or another person. However, the “substantial harm” standard included in\n§164.524(a)(3)(ii) and (iii) would apply in specific circumstances as shown in Table 3. As\ndiscussed above, we have made this change to the finalized § 171.201 to align the harm\nstandard applied by § 171.201 with the one applied by § 164.524(a)(3) where both would\napply, and in analogous circumstances (as described above). As explained above, we revised\nthe harm standard applicable in particular circumstances to avoid setting a higher threshold\nunder § 171.201 for practices likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use149\nof EHI than\nwould be applicable to entirely denying access under § 164.524(a)(ii) or (iii)150\nin the same\ncircumstances. In the finalized § 171.201(d), we have applied the type of harm described in §\n164.524(a)(ii) and (iii) to particular circumstances where § 164.524(a)(ii) and (iii) do not\n149\nAs “access,” “exchange,” and “use” are defined in § 171.102.\n\n150\nPlease note that “access” has a different meaning under 45 CFR 164.524 than in 45 CFR part 171. Regarding an\nindividual’s right of access under 45 CFR 164.524, the term “access” should be understood in that HIPAA Privacy\nRule context.\n\n\n\n\napply, but that are analogous to such circumstances, for the reasons stated in responses to\ncomments above.\n\nTable 3: Mapping of Circumstances under § 171.201(d) to Applicable Harm Standards\nRequirements under § 171.201(d)\nType of Harm Condition\nApplicable Harm Standards151\n§ 171.201(d)(1) – where the practice\ninterferes with access, exchange, or use of the\npatient’s EHI by their legal representative and the\npractice is implemented pursuant to an\nindividualized determination of risk of harm made\nby a licensed health care professional in the\nexercise of professional judgment (§\n171.201(c)(1))\nThe harm of which the actor reasonably\nbelieves the practice will substantially reduce a risk\nmust be the type of harm described in 45 CFR\n164.524(a)(3)(iii), which is substantial harm to the\nindividual or another person.152\n§ 171.201(d)(2) – where the practice\ninterferes with the patient’s or their legal\nrepresentative’s access to, use or exchange of\ninformation that references another natural person\nand the practice is implemented pursuant to an\nindividualized determination of risk of harm made\nby a licensed health care professional in the\nexercise of professional judgment (§\n171.201(c)(1))\nThe harm of which the actor reasonably\nbelieves the practice will substantially reduce a risk\nmust be the type of harm described in 45 CFR\n164.524(a)(3)(ii), which is substantial harm to such\nother person.\n\n§ 171.201(d)(3) – where the practice\ninterferes with the patient’s access, exchange, or\nuse of their own EHI, regardless of whether the\nrisk the practice is implemented to substantially\nreduce is determined on an individualized basis\nby a licensed health care professional in the\nexercise of professional judgment (§\n171.201(c)(1)) or arises from data that is known\nor reasonably suspected to be corrupt due to\ntechnical failure, erroneous for another reason, or\nmisidentified or mismatched (§ 171.201(c)(2))\nThe harm of which the actor reasonably\nbelieves the practice will substantially reduce a risk\nmust be the type of harm described in 45 CFR\n164.524(a)(3)(i), which is a harm to the life or\nphysical safety of the individual or another person.\n\n151\nNote that the “individual” and “access” have different meanings under 45 CFR 164.524 from those in 45 CFR\npart 171. Regarding an individual’s right of access under 45 CFR 164.524, the term “access” should be understood\nin that HIPAA Privacy Rule context.\n\n152\nNote that grounds for denial of an individual’s right of access include that the access is reasonably likely to cause\nthe harm identified in the particular subparagraph under § 164.524(a)(3). For purposes of 45 CFR part 171, we\ninterpret that the stated type of harm must, to the best of the actor’s knowledge and belief, be substantial, in absence\nof particular practice(s), in order for an actor to reasonably believe the practice(s) will substantially reduce that risk.\n\nWe would interpret a reasonable likelihood of the described harm, as used under § 164.524(a)(3) to be a substantial\nrisk for purposes of § 171.201.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements under § 171.201(d)\nType of Harm Condition\nApplicable Harm Standards151\n§ 171.201(d)(4) – where the practice\ninterferes with the patient’s legal representative’s\notherwise legally permissible access, exchange, or\nuse of the patient’s EHI and the practice is\nimplemented to reduce a risk arising from data\nthat is known or reasonably suspected to be\nmisidentified or mismatched, corrupt due to\ntechnical failure, or erroneous for another reason\n(§ 171.201(c)(2))\nThe harm of which the actor reasonably\nbelieves the practice will substantially reduce a risk\nmust be the type of harm described in 45 CFR\n164.524(a)(3)(i), which is a harm to life or physical\nsafety of the individual or another person.\n\nTypes of risk of harm to patients cognizable under this exception.\n\nWe proposed (84 FR 7524) that to qualify for this exception, an actor’s practice must\nrespond to one or more type(s) of risk of harm cognizable under this exception. The three\ntypes of risk of harm that we proposed would satisfy the conditions of this exception are:\n risks arising from corrupt or inaccurate data being recorded or incorporated in a\npatient’s EHI;\n risks arising from misidentification of a patient or patient’s EHI; and\n risks identified by a determination made by a licensed health care professional that a\nspecific access or disclosure of EHI is reasonably likely to endanger the life or\nphysical safety of the patient or another person.\n\nWe provided additional explanation and discussion of these types of risk of harm in\nthe preamble of the proposed rule (84 FR 7524 and 7425). We also requested comment (84 FR\n7525) on:\n Whether these categories of harm capture the full range of safety risks that\nmight arise directly from accessing, exchanging, or using EHI; and\n Whether we should consider other types of patient safety risks related to data\nquality and integrity concerns or that may have a less proximate connection to\n\n\n\n\nEHI but that could provide a reasonable and necessary basis for an actor to\nrestrict or otherwise impede access, exchange, or use of EHI in appropriate\ncircumstances.\n\nWe will first discuss those comments that pertain to the cognizable types of risk of\nharm in general. Comments specific to each of the three types of risk of harm will be\ndiscussed separately, in the order they were presented in the Proposed Rule.\n\n*Comments.* Overall, comments were supportive of the exception recognizing risks of\nharm arising from corrupt or misidentified information, and individualized determinations of\nrisk of harm made by licensed health care professionals in the exercise of professional\njudgment. Numerous commenters requested clarification or additional information to help\nactors more effectively understand and efficiently document their risk determinations in\nconnection to practices for which they would seek to claim that the Preventing Harm\nException applies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback received. In response to comments calling\nbroadly for additional clarification or information, we have provided detailed responses to\ncomments received. Where useful to enrich the discussion, some responses discuss\nhypothetical example situations that illustrate how a particular aspect of the exception would\noperate in such a situation.\n\n*Comments.* Some comments suggested that the determinations and the rationale for\nindividualized determinations by health care professionals in the exercise of professional\njudgment should be documented in the electronic health record.\n\n*Response.* We believe documentation in the EHR, such as in appropriate notes field(s),\nmay be a practical, efficient approach to documentation of determinations of risk of harm\nconsistent with § 171.201 for some — perhaps many — licensed health care professionals.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we confirm that EHRs are considered an appropriate approach or method for the\ndocumenting, and for retaining documentation, of determinations of risk consistent with §\n171.201(c)(1). We also note that much (perhaps all) of the information about the patient’s\nindividual circumstances that factors into the professional’s determination of risk will most\nnaturally and most often be documented in the EHR in the ordinary course of furnishing care\nto the patient. Nothing in § 171.201 would require duplicating information already captured in\nthe EHR in a different form or format specific or unique to § 171.201, whether in the EHR or\nelsewhere. However, we also believe that there is substantial potential for variability in health\ncare professionals’ current methods for documenting risk factors and determinations.\n\nIn addition, we do not believe it is necessary to require different or duplicate\ndocumentation of information that is already otherwise captured in reliable business records\nconsistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule and applicable State laws — including, but not\nlimited to, laws protecting patient privacy or mandating provider reporting of particular types\nof abuse their patients may experience. Therefore, requiring via regulation that all health care\nprofessionals document their determination specifically in the EHR in order to satisfy this\nexception’s conditions could impose an unnecessary burden on those who would like to\nconform their practices to this exception but currently take a different approach to\ndocumenting risk factors or to documenting individualized determinations of risk specific to\naccess, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI by the patient or their legal representative(s).\n\nThus, we have not finalized a requirement that licensed health care professionals must\ndocument in their EHR or in any other particular system(s) their individualized determinations\nof risk of harm in order for the determinations of risk to satisfy the risk of harm condition\nfinalized in 171.201(c)(1).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter noted that minors may not fully understand the\n\n\n\n\nimplications of downloading and sharing their EHI, which represents a different type of risk\nthan the three discussed in the Proposed Rule. The commenter advocated for health care\nproviders to have discretion to impose restrictions on non-emancipated minors’ ability to\naccess their EHI through an API.\n\n*Response.* We did not modify the Preventing Harm Exception in response to this\ncomment. The Preventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201) is intended to apply to practices an\nactor reasonably believes will substantially reduce a risk of harm to one or more particular\nperson(s), and in many circumstances (§ 171.201(d)(3) or (4)) a risk of harm to the life or\nphysical safety of particular persons, such as: a patient or person in the patient’s life; or\nmultiple patients whose EHI was corrupted or mismatched due to a technical failure of an\nactor’s systems. Where a non-emancipated minor, or other patient, is otherwise legally entitled\nto access or receive their own health information that does not include identified information\nabout another person, the Preventing Harm Exception will apply only to those practices\nreasonable and necessary to address risk to the life or physical safety of another person\nconsistent with § 171.201(d)(3) and its specific cross-reference to § 164.524(a)(3)(i). The\nPrivacy Exception (§ 171.202) is intended to recognize reasonable and necessary practices to\nprotect patients’ privacy. We also note that we have clarified in this final rule that although\npractices that purport to educate patients about the privacy and security practices of\napplications and parties with which a patient chooses to share their EHI would always be\nsubject to review by OIG if there were a claim of information blocking, such practices likely\nwould not be considered to interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI if they meet\ncertain criteria (see section VIII.C.6, above).\n\nRisk of corrupt or inaccurate data being recorded or incorporated in a patient’s\nelectronic health record\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed (84 FR 7524) that the Preventing Harm Exception could apply to\npractices that address risks of harm arising from corrupted or inaccurate EHI being recorded\nor incorporated in a patient’s electronic health record. We further proposed that recognized\nrisks from incorrect or inaccurate information would be limited to those arising from known or\nreasonably suspected corruption and inaccuracies caused by performance and technical issues\naffecting health IT. We clarified that the Preventing Harm Exception would not extend to\npurported accuracy issues arising from the incompleteness of a patient’s electronic health\nrecord generally. We acknowledged that Federal and State laws may require an actor to obtain\nan individual’s written consent before sharing specific health information, such as information\nsubject to 42 CFR part 2. However, we expressly noted in the Proposed Rule that this\nexception would not apply to an actor’s conduct in refusing to provide access, exchange, or\nuse of the remainder of the patient’s record on the basis that the information withheld per\npatient’s non-consent would render the remainder of the patient’s record incomplete and thus\ninaccurate. We also noted that known inaccuracies in some data within a record may not be\nsufficient justification to withhold the entire record so long as the remainder of the patient’s\nEHI could be effectively shared without also presenting the known incorrect or corrupted\ninformation as if it were trustworthy.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were supportive of the Preventing Harm Exception applying\nto appropriate practices to address corrupt or incorrect data in EHI and the risks that would\notherwise arise from propagation of corrupt or otherwise incorrect EHI within a patient’s\nrecord.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate all of the feedback received, including but not limited to\nconfirmation that responding stakeholders are supportive of this exception applying to\npractices an actor reasonably believes will substantially reduce a risk of harm otherwise\n\n\n\n\narising from access, exchange, or use of corrupt or inaccurate data within a patient’s record.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter, acknowledging that patients’ wishes that specific\ninformation not be shared should be honored, advocated expanding this exception to cover\nphysicians’ declining to disclose any EHI to other physicians where withholding of some\ninformation at the patient’s request would, in the disclosing physician’s view, render the\npatient’s record so distorted as to be misleading.\n\n*Response.* As we explained in the Proposed Rule, we would not recognize\nincompleteness of the EHI that an actor can disclose as a source of a risk of harm cognizable\nunder this exception. For instance, patients may make requests that specific information not be\naccessed, exchanged, or used beyond a specific clinician-patient (or other relevant)\nrelationship because the information is associated with a stigmatized condition, or for personal\nreasons (such as the patient’s subjective perception the information may be embarrassing or\notherwise detrimental to them). In the Proposed Rule, we provided an illustrative example of a\npatient declining consent to share 42 CFR part 2 substance abuse treatment information, and\nstated we would not consider the remainder of the patient’s record inaccurate based on its\nincompleteness (84 FR 7524). Health care providers receiving any patient’s records of prior\ncare presumably have an awareness of the potential that some information may be omitted\nfrom the information they receive for a wide variety of reasons that include, but that are not\nlimited to, patients’ intentional choices to withhold some information. Therefore, we do not\nbelieve it would be appropriate to consider EHI to be corrupt, inaccurate, or otherwise\nerroneous where it is simply a subset of everything an actor knows about the patient.\n\nWe are not persuaded that a patient’s withholding consent to share specific portions of\ntheir overall EHI, regardless of the patient’s rationale for withholding consent, would render\nthe data set their physician (or other health care provider) could share more dangerous to the\n\n\n\n\npatient than sharing none of the patient’s EHI with another of the patient’s providers. Instead,\nwe remind health care providers that nothing in part 171 overrides Federal, State, or tribal law\nprotections of patients’ privacy preferences. Likewise, nothing in part 171 reduces variation in\nwhat and how much information patients remember, or are willing, to disclose to their health\ncare providers. Patients remain free to withhold various information from their health care\nproviders, including but not limited to what other providers they may have seen in the past.\n\nBefore enactment of the Cures Act, health care providers could not safely assume\nevery patient record they received from any source necessarily included all the information\nthat could or should be known by that source that would be relevant to the patient’s health or\ncare by that provider, even where the source can permissibly share everything they do know.\n\nThus, we reiterate that we do not believe it is reasonable or necessary for purposes of\npreventing harm that a provider withhold the EHI that they could permissibly share in any\nparticular circumstance simply because they happen to have more EHI than they can\npermissibly share.\n\nHowever, we also highlight that for purposes of this exception a data export or access\nmechanism appropriately showing that some data may be unavailable or omitted from the\nexport or presentation is materially different from a data export or presentation that\nmisrepresents the patient’s EHI. For example, exports or presentations omitting all medication\ndata and correctly stating “medication data not available,”153\nwe would not consider corrupt,\ninaccurate, or otherwise erroneous. By contrast, however, an export or presentation stating “no\ncurrent medications,” or stating “none” or “none known” in the medication section, when in\nfact the system producing the export or representation does include current known\n153\nOr otherwise indicating, in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, that absence of information in the extract\nor representation should not be understood as a statement that there is no such data in the source system.\n\n\n\n\nmedications for the patient, represents a type of risk recognized under § 171.201(c)(2).\n\nUnder § 171.201(d)(4), as finalized, a practice that is likely to, or that in fact does,\ninterfere with otherwise permissible access, exchange, or use of a patient’s EHI by their health\ncare providers must be one the actor implementing the practice reasonably believes will\nsubstantially reduce a risk of harm of a type that could serve as grounds for denial of the\nindividual’s right of access to their EHI under the 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3)(i). Therefore, in\norder for a practice likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI by one of the\npatient’s health care providers to satisfy the conditions of the Preventing Harm Exception, the\nactor must hold a reasonable belief that the practice will substantially reduce a risk to the\npatient’s, or another natural person’s, life or physical safety that would otherwise arise from\nthe access, exchange, or use of the EHI with which the practice interferes. Erroneous\nmisrepresentations that a patient is not known to be taking any medications, when in fact they\nare known to be taking one or more medications, is typically a system problem and one that\ncan give rise to risk to the physical safety, or even the life, of any or all patients whose EHI\nmay be affected by the problem.\n\n*Comments.* One comment submission highlighted a tension between the data-provision\npreferences of health care providers requesting data and other actors (such as other providers\nand their health IT developers) from whom data is requested. This commenter indicated\nproviders requesting data, such as long-term/post-acute providers caring for patients after a\nhospital stay, may currently have to wait days to receive any of the patient’s clinical data from\nthe hospital stay because the hospital or its health IT developer refuses to generate and send\nthe C-CDA document until every last data element is finalized. The commenter suggested we\nclarify whether § 171.201 would apply to such circumstances.\n\n*Response.* An actor’s practice of delaying fulfillment of an otherwise feasible and\n\n\n\n\nlegally permissible request for exchange, access, or use of EHI that is finalized and available\nto the actor merely because the actor knows more EHI for that patient will become available at\nsome later date would not satisfy the conditions of § 171.201. As we stated in the Proposed\nRule, we do not view mere incompleteness of a patient record as rendering the remainder of\nthe patient’s record inaccurate (84 FR 7524). We recognize that specific data points may not\nbe appropriate to disclose or exchange until they are finalized. Such data points would include,\nbut are not necessarily limited to: laboratory results pending confirmation or otherwise not yet\nconsidered by the hospital reliable for purposes of clinical decision making; or notes that the\nclinician has begun to draft but cannot finalize until they receive (confirmed) laboratory or\npathology results or other information needed to complete their decision making. We hope it\nis, and will be increasingly, rare that an actor cannot effectively sequester non-finalized EHI\nfrom finalized EHI. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some actors may face\nthat problem at some point. If an actor cannot effectively sequester non-finalized EHI from a\nparticular access, exchange, or use where inclusion of non-finalized EHI would not be\nappropriate, the actor should refer to the new Content and Manner Exception (finalized in §\n171.301) or the Infeasibility Exception finalized in § 171.204.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters expressed concerns that many actors’ health IT\nsystems currently lack the capability to segment data by class and element that would be\nneeded to withhold only those classes or elements that were corrupted or erroneous as\ndescribed in the Proposed Rule. Commenters requested clarification on whether the § 171.201\nPreventing Harm Exception would in these cases apply to the entirety of the patient’s EHI,\nhow it would apply, or if another exception would also be needed.\n\n*Response.* In the circumstances these comments described, the Preventing Harm\nException will apply only to the EHI known or reasonably suspected to be corrupt or\n\n\n\n\nerroneous. If an actor lacks the data segmentation capabilities that would be needed to\nsequester only that data known or reasonably suspected to be corrupt or erroneous from the\nrequested access, exchange, or use, we would encourage the actor to consider meeting the\nconditions of another exception with respect to the remaining EHI. For example, the Content\nand Manner Exception (§ 171.301) may allow for the actor to provide the requestor with the\nEHI not known or reasonably suspected to be corrupt or erroneous, albeit in a different way\nthan was initially requested. Or, if the actor lacks the technical capability to share the EHI that\nis not known or reasonably suspected to be corrupt or erroneous consistent with the Content\nand Manner Exception (§ 171.301), then the actor may wish to meet the Infeasibility\nException (§ 171.204). The applicability of the exceptions will depend on the particularized\ncircumstances, including but not limited to the specific request made. We believe the\nconditions of these exceptions also offer frameworks within which a responding actor and an\nEHI requester may be able to identify a mutually agreeable approach to making trustworthy\nEHI appropriately available in at least some of the instances where a request cannot be safely\nfulfilled in exactly the manner of the requester’s first preference.\n\n*Comments.* One comment expressed a concern that some health care providers,\nparticularly those already receiving feedback from payers about their data quality, might\nbelieve the Preventing Harm Exception would allow them to withhold patients’ access to the\npatients’ own EHI to prevent the patients from seeing data quality issues the provider knows\nor believes are present in that EHI.\n\n*Response.* If a provider knows that the data quality issues in their records serve as a\nsource of risk consistent with § 171.201(c)(2), so as to form the basis of a reasonable belief the\npatient’s accessing or using the data would place the patient at risk of harm cognizable under\n\n\n\n\nthis exception,154\nthe exception would apply if all other conditions of the exception were met.\n\nHowever, known corruption or other errors that would place a patient accessing their EHI at\nrisk of harm cognizable under this exception on the basis of accessing — and presumably\nmaking health or care decisions based on — that EHI would also raise a substantial concern\nregarding the safety of that EHI for use by the provider. Thus, we would expect that whenever\na given health care provider believes the EHI within their records is safe enough for their own\nuse in the delivery of patient care, the Preventing Harm Exception would not excuse the\nprovider from honoring their patients’ requests to access, exchange, or use that EHI simply\nbecause the patients might discover error(s) in that EHI. If, to the actor’s knowledge or\nreasonable belief, only some data classes or elements within a patient’s EHI are a source of\nrisk consistent with § 171.201(c)(2), the actor should continue to make the remaining data\nclasses and elements available to the patients and other requestors (as appropriate under\napplicable law). Where the actor lacks the technical ability to appropriately sequester only the\ncorrupt or erroneous data within the EHI they hold for given patient(s), the actor should\nreference the Content and Manner Exception finalized in § 171.301 or the Infeasibility\nException finalized in 171.204.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested clarification on whether an actor has a\nresponsibility to assess the data in their possession, custody, or control for risk of harm before\nmaking it available for access, exchange, or use.\n\n*Response.* The conditions finalized in § 171.201 for practices that interfere with the\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI for purposes of preventing harm to be excepted from the\n154\nNote that where the practice interferes with a patient’s access to their own EHI, the applicable harm standard is\nestablished in § 171.201(d)(3) and is the same one established at § 164.524(a)(3)(i). Currently, that would be harm\nto life or physical safety.\n\n\n\n\ndefinition of information blocking (§ 171.103) do not require that actors generally evaluate\ndata requested for data quality issues or other sources of risk of harm before fulfilling requests\nfor access, exchange, or use of the EHI. At the same time, actors should be aware that where\nan actor may have an affirmative duty under otherwise applicable law for the quality or\naccuracy of data, or for assessing other types of risk of harm that could be implicated by an\nEHI access, exchange, or use request, nothing in § 171.201 should be construed as lessening\nor otherwise changing that duty. For example, the Preventing Harm Exception does not lessen\nor otherwise change an actor’s existing obligations to ensure patient EHI is created, recorded,\nand maintained to standards of accuracy and reliability consistent with laws, regulations, and\naccreditation requirements applicable to the particular actor in any given circumstance.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed appreciation for the inclusion of this exception so\nthat health care providers will not be forced to share incorrect data. Several of these\ncommenters requested we clarify a provider’s responsibility for correcting corrupt or incorrect\ninformation once it is discovered.\n\n*Response.* For health care providers, existing State and Federal laws and regulations\naddress the responsibility to maintain appropriate records of health care furnished and in\nsupport of reimbursement sought from various programs and payers. Health care providers\nthat have obtained voluntary accreditations may have made additional commitments related to\nrecord-keeping and data quality in context of obtaining and maintaining those accreditations.\n\nThese existing responsibilities of health care providers are not lessened or otherwise changed\nby the Preventing Harm Exception. The exception simply provides for exception from the\ndefinition of information blocking at § 171.103 of practices interfering with the access,\nexchange, or use of mismatched, corrupt due to technical failure, or otherwise erroneous EHI\nin order to substantially reduce a risk of harm. Presuming its conditions are otherwise met, §\n\n\n\n\n171.201 would apply to a variety of practices appropriate to correct mismatched, corrupt due\nto technical failure, or otherwise erroneous EHI in a manner consistent with otherwise\napplicable law, regulations, accreditation standards, and payment program standards.\n\n*Comments.* One comment requested clarity regarding the applicability of this\nexception to data received from a third party, where the actual accuracy of the data cannot be,\nor has not been, confirmed by the actor asked to make that data available for access, exchange,\nor use.\n\n*Response.* We recognize that in some circumstances the available and feasible\nmechanisms for EHI access, exchange, or use may not support as much data provenance\ninformation as an actor might prefer. In such circumstances, the actor would be free to\ncommunicate supplemental information about specific data’s provenance to a requestor.\n\nHowever, the conditions of the Preventing Harm Exception would not be met where EHI\nrequested was received from a third party and the actor could not confirm the accuracy of the\nEHI.\n\n*Comments.* A comment from the perspective of health IT developers and implementers\nstated that this exception should allow an actor to err on the side of caution as the actor looks\nto determine the extent of potential distortions in a record before sharing it. A number of\ncommenters described practices used today by HIEs to assess and resolve data quality issues,\nincluding but not limited to taking all of the records from a particular source offline while\nassessing the extent or cause of issues identified in some record(s) from that source.\n\n*Response.* The Preventing Harm Exception is intended to apply to a variety of\npractices reasonable and necessary to protect patients from risk of harm arising from access,\nexchange, or use of data that is known or reasonably suspected to be corrupt, inaccurate,\nmismatched, or misidentified. To be covered by the exception, the practice may interfere with\n\n\n\n\nthe access, exchange, or use of EHI only to the minimum extent necessary to substantially\nreduce a risk of harm cognizable under the exception, but the exception does not require that\nevery record affected by the practice have first been confirmed to contain corrupt,\nmismatched, or otherwise dangerously problematic data. In some circumstances, such as a\nparticular data source experiencing a known or reasonably suspected system or other technical\nfailure producing widespread corruption, mismatching, or other dangerous errors, the\nminimum reasonable and necessary precautions may make all records from that source\nunavailable pending resolution of the technical failure and its risk-producing effects. The\nactor’s knowledge or reasonable suspicion could be appropriately derived in various ways.\n\nThese ways would include, but are not limited to: detection of specific data quality issues in a\nsampling of records from the particular source; or receipt of notice from a source that they had\nexperienced technical issues or failures resulting in corruption, mismatching, or other data\nquality issues giving rise to risks of harm cognizable under this exception.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter noted that this exception should be applied rarely, and when\napplied should not be a mechanism to selectively block information from specific actors.\n\nHowever, several other commenters made observations that, in current practice, EHI coming\nfrom sources whose data has a pattern of higher-than-normal error rates may be subjected to\nmore extensive review, and potentially delayed in broader availability, compared with EHI\nfrom sources whose data error rate is within a more normal range. Comments describing such\ncurrent practices recommended that this exception should allow for continued application of\nadditional data quality assurance processing to EHI from sources whose data exhibits a history\nor pattern of more numerous or more risky data quality issues.\n\n*Response.* If an actor were to engage in practices systematically interfering with\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI from a particular source based on considerations extraneous\n\n\n\n\nto the prevalence and risk profile of data quality issues in the EHI, such practices would not\nmeet the conditions to be excepted under § 171.201 from the definition of information\nblocking finalized in § 171.103. Examples of considerations we would consider to be\nextraneous in this context notably include, but are not limited to, whether the data source was\ncompetitor of the actor and whether the actor may harbor personal animus toward the data\nsource. However, this exception would apply to practices not based in whole or any part on\nconsiderations extraneous to the prevalence and risk profile of data quality issues in the EHI,\nprovided each such practice meets all conditions in § 171.201 that are applicable to the\ncircumstances in which it is used.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters noted that integration of data from various types of sources is\nchallenging because of differences in the data elements that different types of sources can\nexchange, and because of technical differences in how similar data elements may be\nstructured, defined, or encoded across different types of sources. Commenters also stated that\ndata from new exchange partners may raise questions about potential accuracy issues in\ninterpreting and integrating different types of data as well as integrating similar data from\nvarious types of sources. Commenters recommended that § 171.201 recognize that practices\nmay delay integration and availability of EHI in order to address these issues, and also\nrecommended that a time limit be established for completing evaluations of incoming data.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ highlighting that the U.S. health care system as\na whole includes opportunities for access, exchange, and use of a wider variety of data classes\nand elements than are currently addressed by standards and implementation specifications\nadopted in part 170, and more sources than just those actors currently using certified health IT.\n\nWe are aware that, in a variety of circumstances, safely and appropriately integrating data\nfrom a new source may require time to determine and apply appropriate processing\n\n\n\n\napproaches to ensure that data are not corrupted in the process of mapping or converting them\nto the structures and standards used by the recipient. Our finalized exception will apply to\nappropriately tailored practices for assessing and mitigating risks otherwise posed by\nintegration of data from new sources, that is not standardized, or that is standardized to non-\npublished, proprietary, or obsolete standards. In cases where the original meaning of EHI\nreceived cannot be determined in a manner allowing for conversion to the formats and\nstandards used by the recipient’s systems, it may sometimes be necessary to decline to\nintegrate such data in the recipient’s production systems. However, we believe it would be\npremature to establish via this rulemaking specific time limits for assessment and processing\nof EHI received from new exchange partners, in large part due to the considerable variability\nin systems and circumstances of the actors involved in such exchange relationships. Should\nthe need arise to assess the reasonableness, necessity, and timeliness of an actor’s practices\napplied to data received from new or various types of sources, we would do so in context of\nthe specific circumstances in which particular practices were applied by particular actor(s).\n\nFinalized policy for risks of harm arising from corrupt or inaccurate data\nWe have finalized the type of risk condition with modifications to the proposed\nregulation text. We have reorganized the regulation text, and in the context of that\nreorganization rephrased the statement of some conditions. We have also, in § 171.201(c)(2)\nreplaced the word “inaccurate” (used in proposed § 171.201(a)(2)) with “erroneous” to better\ndifferentiate between normal shortfalls in the complete accuracy of a record and risk-\ngenerating errors in the data. We also combine all data-specific sources of risk of harm in the\nfinal § 171.201(c)(2) instead of splitting them across two paragraphs as was the case in §\n171.201(a)(1) (“corrupt or inaccurate” in the Proposed Rule) and § 171.201(a)(2)\n(“misidentified or mismatched” in the Proposed Rule). We made this change because\n\n\n\n\nmisidentified, mismatched, corrupt, and otherwise erroneous data are all sources of risk\narising from issues with the data rather than characteristics unique to a patient or their\ncircumstances. Additional conditions must be met for § 171.201 to apply to practices\nimplemented to substantially reduce a risk of harm arising from data issues (consistent with §\n171.201(c)(2)), including § 171.201(a), (b), (d)(3) or (4), and (f)(1) or (2). Whether (d)(3) or\n(d)(4) applies turns on whether the practice is likely to, or does, interfere with a patient’s own\nor other legally permissible access, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI. Whether (f)(1) or\n(f)(2) applies turns on whether the actor implements the practice consistent with an\norganizational policy (f)(1) or based on a determination based on the particularized facts and\ncircumstances known or reasonably believed by the actor at the time the determination was\nmade and while the practice remains in use (f)(2).\n\nFor purposes of providing additional information and explanation as requested by\nmany commenters, we reiterate that a risk of harm arising from data that is known or\nreasonably suspected to be misidentified or mismatched, corrupt due to technical failure, or\nerroneous for another reason (§ 171.201(c)(2) as finalized) will not, consistent with discussion\nand illustrative examples in the preamble to the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7524), satisfy the\nconditions of the Preventing Harm Exception if it turns on mere speculation about, or\npossibilities of, as-yet-undetected inaccuracies or other imperfections in the EHI. An\nelectronic health record, like the paper chart it replaces, is inevitably less than perfectly\ncomplete and precisely accurate across 100 percent of the variables potentially relevant to the\nindividual’s health. Because the risk that records in general may be imperfect is a risk that we\nunderstand as inherent to (and thus ordinarily addressed in the course of) clinical practice, it\nwill not be recognized as justifying practices that implicate the information blocking\ndefinition. Thus, the Preventing Harm Exception finalized in § 171.201 does not extend to\n\n\n\n\npurported accuracy issues arising from potential, suspected, or known incompleteness of a\npatient’s electronic health record generally, such as the possibility of a patient choosing, or not\nremembering, to mention some of the medications they regularly take. Similarly, the\npossibility that any given patient’s EHI could at any time contain sporadic, undetected,\ninaccurate data points as a result of data entry errors—such as an entered weight of 123\ninstead of the accurate observation of 132—would not be interpreted as satisfying the\ncondition finalized in § 171.201(c)(2).\n\nThe Preventing Harm Exception will apply in those instances where specific EHI of\none or more patients is affected by a risk consistent with the finalized § 171.201(c)(2).\n\nAssuming its other conditions that are applicable to the specific circumstances are met, the\nPreventing Harm Exception will apply to appropriately tailored practices that affect a\nparticular patient’s EHI regardless of the origin or cause of known or reasonably suspected\ndata issues giving rise to risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(2), and to the use of the\npractices for such time as is reasonable and necessary to amend or correct the patient’s EHI. In\nassessing timeliness and reasonableness of an actor’s approach to making such corrections, we\nwould take into consideration the facts and circumstances within which they operate,\nincluding but not limited to licensure or certification requirements applicable to the actor’s\nEHI governance. For a health care provider, we anticipate such licensure or certification\nrequirements will typically include clinical records standards set by State licensure laws and\nadditional standards applicable to that provider given their specific circumstances, such as\npatient records maintenance standards set by issuing bodies of facility/organizational\naccreditations or professional board certifications the provider may also hold.\n\nWhere an actor lacks the technical capability to sequester from otherwise legally\npermissible access, exchange, or use only that subset of EHI the actor knows or reasonably\n\n\n\n\nsuspects is affected by data issues giving rise to risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(2),\nthe Preventing Harm Exception will not recognize withholding of the remaining EHI. In such\ncircumstances, an actor should refer to the exceptions for Content and Manner (§ 171.301) and\nInfeasibility (§ 171.204), as may be applicable, in regard to the EHI that they do not know or\nreasonably suspect to be affected by data issues giving rise to risk of harm consistent with §\n171.201(c)(2).\n\nRisk arising from misidentifying a patient or mismatching patients’ electronic health\ninformation\nThe Preventing Harm Exception is intended to apply to practices that are designed to\npromote data quality and integrity and to support health IT applications properly identifying\nand matching patient records or EHI. As discussed in the preamble to the Proposed Rule (84\nFR 7524), accurately identifying patients and correctly attributing their EHI to them is a\ncomplex task and involves layers of safeguards. The task requires application of appropriate\nprocedures for verifying a patient’s identity and properly registering the patient in health IT\nsystems. Safeguards include such usability and implementation decisions such as ensuring the\ndisplay of a patient’s name and date of birth, and perhaps a recent photograph, on every screen\nfrom which clinicians and other caregivers access, enter, and/or modify data in the patient’s\nrecord. When a clinician, other health IT user, or other actor knows or reasonably suspects that\nspecific EHI is not correctly attributed to one or more particular patient(s), it would be\nreasonable for them to avoid sharing the EHI that could introduce or propagate errors in\npatient records and thereby pose risks to the patient(s) affected.155\n155\nPlease note that practices designed and implemented to ensure that persons requesting access to their EHI are\nwho they claim to be and give them access to only that EHI that is theirs would not be cognizable under the\nPreventing Harm Exception; we have established two other exceptions designed to address practices reasonable and\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Preventing Harm Exception as proposed, an actor’s response to the risk of\nmisidentified patient health information would need to be no broader than necessary to\nmitigate the risk of harm arising from the potentially misidentified record or misattributed data\n(84 FR 7524). For example, under the proposed exception, an actor—such as a health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT—refusing to provide a batch export on the basis that the\nexported records might contain a misidentified record would not find that practice recognized\nunder this exception. Similarly, a health care provider or other actor that identified that a\nparticular piece of information had been misattributed to a patient would not be excused under\n§ 171.201 from exchanging or providing access to all other EHI about the patient that had not\nbeen misattributed. The actor knowing or reasonably suspecting some data had been\nmisidentified or misattributed would also be expected to confirm the extent of such errors and\nto take appropriate steps to correct their own records, consistent with applicable law,\nregulations, and accreditation standards applicable to the actor, and best practices or other\nappropriate industry benchmarks for health records and information management.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended we consider that actors bear significant\nresponsibility to preserve and promote data quality and integrity, and that actors generally take\nrisk-averse approaches to preventing and to assessing and resolving errors in identifying EHI\nand matching patient EHI.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to assure all stakeholders that we are aware\nthat the EHI an actor receives from various sources may feature a variety of characteristics\nthat call for varying degrees of pre-processing to achieve a level of matching accuracy\nconsidered by the health care provider community to be sufficient for safe use of the data in\nnecessary to protect the privacy (see § 171.202) and security (see § 171.203) of individuals’ EHI.\n\n\n\n\npatient care. In some circumstances, we understand additional or special processing—\nincluding but not necessarily limited to human eyes-on analysis to confirm matches—may be\nneeded before records are deemed to have been accurately matched, and that data requiring\nhuman processing may be delayed in integration and availability compared with data that can\nbe satisfactorily matched through an actor’s automated means. Section 171.201 will apply to\nsuch practices provided all of its conditions are met.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended the finalized exception recognize as reasonable\nand necessary to protect patient safety practices such as sequestering from access and\nexchange all records from a particular source, or affected by a particular system or technical\nprocess, until the scope and cause of patient matching or attribution issues can be identified\nand appropriately resolved. Commenters stated such practices are commonly used today by\nHINs/HIEs, and provided illustrative examples of current practice. Comments described as an\nexample current practice of HIEs not making available any record(s) that their monitoring for\ntechnical or other issues identifies as an improperly matched patient record—and any other\nrecords that may be affected by a similar technical issue—until the record(s) can be corrected\nto include only accurately matched data.\n\n*Response.* We do understand that a variety of methods and approaches may currently\nbe needed to assess the scope, identify, and appropriately address the cause of patient\nmatching or attribution errors. Section 171.201 will apply to practices otherwise meeting its\nconditions that affect more patients’ records than those specifically confirmed to include\nmismatched or misattributed EHI. Where its conditions are otherwise met, the exception will\napply to use of practices likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI that the actor\nknows includes mismatched or misattributed data or reasonably suspects includes such errors.\n\nReasonable suspicion could be formed on various bases, such as objectively observable\n\n\n\n\npatterns of association between detected errors and a particular data source, application,\nsystem, or process. However, a practice of delaying the availability of records from any\nparticular data source based on factors extraneous to matching processes and accuracy would\nnot be excepted from the definition of information blocking. Examples of extraneous factors\ninclude, but are not limited to, whether the data source was competitor of the actor and\nwhether the actor may harbor personal animus toward the data source.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested the Preventing Harm Exception allow for\nproviders to refuse to release pediatric data to direct-to-consumer applications unless the\nprovider was satisfied with the applications’ ability to properly segment the data where\nmultiple users’ records might be stored in the same instance of the application. Specifically,\nthe comment expressed a concern that if applications are not set up to safely handle multiple\npatients, data from multiple patients could be mixed together in ways that create a potential for\nserious harm stemming from how those data might then be used or interpreted.\n\n*Response.* The potential for EHI to be mismatched (or otherwise mishandled) by an\napplication, whether mobile or otherwise, is neither unique to pediatric patients’ EHI nor\nparticular to apps that receive the patient’s data from a provider’s API. A patient whose\nprovider has not yet implemented a standards-based API could use other means to get their\nEHI into their chosen direct-to-consumer app. Such means could include accessing view,\ndownload, and transmit functionality of the provider’s certified health IT via the patient portal\nand transmitting an extract of their data in C-CDA format to the recipient of the patient’s (or\ntheir legal representative’s) choice. An individual or their representative could also exercise\nthe individual’s right of access under the HIPAA Privacy Rule to obtain the individual’s EHI\nthat is accessible under this right, in another format in which it is readily producible, and then\nupload it to an app of their choosing. In general, we do not believe it would be appropriate to\n\n\n\n\nextend the Preventing Harm Exception to apply to practices whereby actors would limit\notherwise legally permissible access, exchange, or use of patient EHI based on concerns that a\nrequestor will not handle patient matching in a manner acceptable to the actor. Therefore, this\nexception will not apply to actors’ refusal to allow access, exchange, or use of EHI on grounds\nthat the actor may not know, or may not be satisfied with, the matching methods to be used by\na recipient of the EHI after the EHI has been securely transferred to the recipient. Provided the\npractices meet its conditions, the Security Exception (§ 171.203) will apply to a variety of\npractices directly related and tailored to specific security threats to the actor’s systems and\nEHI within those systems that may be posed by particular connections or interfaces with third-\nparty systems or software. We also note that practices that do not inappropriately discourage\npatients from accessing, exchanging, or using their EHI as they choose, but that are\nappropriately designed and implemented to help patients make more informed choices about\ntheir EHI and apps can be designed and implemented to avoid meeting the definition of\ninformation blocking finalized in § 171.103.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed a concern that this exception could become a\npretext for an actor to avoid sharing EHI on basis of the actor not being satisfied with the\naccuracy achieved by a prospective recipient’s patient matching methods. This commenter\nrequested ONC clarify that this exception does not allow for an actor to take a position that it\nwill not share EHI unless the requesting entity demonstrates it will match patients using a\nmethod, or to a degree of accuracy, satisfactory to the actor being requested to share the\ninformation.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe it would be appropriate to extend the Preventing Harm\nException to apply to practices whereby actors would limit otherwise legally permissible\naccess, exchange, or use of patient EHI based on concerns that a requestor will not handle\n\n\n\n\npatient matching in a manner acceptable to the actor. Various recipients and users of EHI will\nhave different purposes and contexts of data use and thus may appropriately deem differing\nlevels of assurance of match accuracy satisfactory to meet their obligations, for patient safety\nor otherwise. Therefore, this exception will not apply to actors’ refusal to allow access,\nexchange, or use of EHI on grounds that the actor may not know, or may not be satisfied with,\nthe matching methods to be used by a recipient of the EHI after the EHI has been securely\ntransferred to the recipient.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters specifically discussed concerns about potential misuse\nof this exception on a claim of patient matching concerns, and that this exception could lessen\nactors’ motivations for improving their patient match capabilities. Some commenters\nsuggested specific additional requirements for applicability of this exception to practices\nimplemented to reduce risks of harm arising from mismatch or misidentification of patient\nEHI, in order to guard against its misuse or potentially incentivizing stagnation in rates of\npatient matching capabilities advancement. Additional requirements that commenters\nsuggested were:\n that an actor only be able to take advantage of this exception on basis of\nmismatch if the actor’s matching methods met or exceeded a performance\nthreshold;\n that the actor proactively communicates to requestors the actor’s minimum\nmatching criteria and other aspects of its matching methods; and\n a requirement for specific features in the actor’s systems, such as returning\ninformative error messages regarding match failures.\n\n*Response.* We are aware there is variation across actors in technical capabilities\nrelevant to patient matching, resources to improve those capabilities, and other operational\n\n\n\n\nconsiderations. We are not aware of clear evidence or broad industry consensus on specific\npractices or performance thresholds that should apply to across all EHI use cases and\noperational contexts. We believe it would be premature to limit the availability of this\nexception to actors able to implement specific practices or meet particular metrics of patient\nmatching performance specified through this rulemaking. Because this exception is intended\nto except from the definition of information blocking in § 171.103 practices that are\nreasonable and necessary to protect patients from risks of cognizable harm attributable to\ntypes of risk specifically including risks arising from mismatched EHI, rather than to drive\nchanges in patient matching practices in the industry, such requirements could render this\nexception unavailable in circumstances where it is intended to apply. Thus, we have\ndetermined that it is more appropriate to leave actors engaged in using data the discretion and\nresponsibility for determining what level of certainty in the accuracy of record matching is\nnecessary for their use of the EHI. We appreciate this opportunity to clarify that the\nPreventing Harm Exception would not excuse actors from making appropriate good faith\nefforts to match patient records, which we expect will ordinarily include communication and\ncooperation between data sources and recipients. Moreover, we believe an actor will generally\nhave a natural incentive to communicate proactively, appropriately, and in good faith with\nthose with whom they exchange data, specifically to minimize unnecessary extra processing\nand follow-up communications on the part of both exchange partners. Therefore, we have not\nmodified the Preventing Harm Exception’s conditions in response to these comments.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed a concern that to ensure they do not release\ninformation that has potential errors in patient matching or attribution, they will need to invest\nin improved patient record matching accuracy, which the commenter indicates would for them\ninclude new technical solutions compared with their current practice.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* This exception is not intended, and we are not persuaded that as finalized it\nwill function, to impose a new or specific obligation on actors to ensure they do not release\ninformation that could contain latent errors. Other commenters did recommend we consider\ndoing so. However, for the reasons stated above in response to those comments, we have not\nestablished a pre-requisite that an actor meet a particular threshold of patient-matching\nperformance before this exception will apply to practices otherwise meeting the conditions of\n§ 171.201 applicable in the particular circumstances, including that the actor can demonstrate\na reasonable belief the practice(s) will substantially reduce a risk of harm cognizable under §\n171.201. We emphasize that we have not established a pre-requisite for applicability of §\n171.201 that would call upon an actor to use particular methods, or satisfy particular threshold\nperformance rates on any specific metric, for patient identification and matching.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested clarification as to whether a patient would be\nliable for accessing another patient’s EHI that had been mismatched or misattributed to the\npatient accessing the information.\n\n*Response.* This issue is outside the scope of this rulemaking. Those concerned or\ncurious about it should reference Federal, 156\nState, or tribal law and regulations—or reliable\nsources of information about Federal,157\nState, or tribal law and regulations—applicable to\nany individual’s (or entity’s) unauthorized access to or use of another’s personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) in the particular jurisdiction(s) and circumstances of potential concern.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested creation of a hold-harmless or “safe harbor”\npolicy protecting data recipients from liability for actions taken in good faith reliance on\n156\nPotentially applicable Federal law and regulations are not limited to HIPAA and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule may be a useful place for those who share interest in the question raised by these\ncomments to begin obtaining additional information.\n\n157\nAuthoritative information about the HIPAA Privacy Rule is available in the health information privacy section of\nthe HHS website, starting at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html\n\n\n\n\ninformation received after applying best-practice matching methods.\n\n*Response.* The suggestion appears to reference a safe harbor from liability for\ndecisions or other actions taken in reliance on the EHI in question. That is outside the scope of\nthis rule. Actors should implement matching methodologies and practices in full awareness\nthat this final rule will not change their responsibility under other applicable law for\nmaintaining appropriately reliable medical or other business records. This final rule also does\nnot alter clinicians’ responsibilities for exercising sound professional judgment in making\nclinical decisions based on EHI available to them in context of what they know or reasonably\nbelieve about the EHI’s reliability.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested, in context and reference to the Preventing Harm\nException, guidance regarding what an actor is obligated to do if they receive EHI as a result\nof provider matching failure. One commenter specifically requested guidance on what sort of\ngood faith efforts to direct the EHI to the correct recipient would be expected of an inadvertent\nrecipient of mis-directed EHI.\n\n*Response.* A provider or other actor who receives EHI that they have reason to believe\nmay have been directed to them by mistake has no obligation under part 171 to identify the\ncorrect recipient or to forward the EHI to the correct recipient. The actor who believes they\nmay have received mis-directed EHI should upon forming such belief follow their established\npractices for handling of PHI and PII received in known or suspected error. We presume these\nestablished practices are consistent with Federal, State, or tribal law applicable to the\nparticular actor in the particular operational circumstances.\n\nStatement of finalized policy for risks arising from misidentified or mismatched EHI\nWe are finalizing the substance of this part of the exception as proposed, with\nmodifications to how it is expressed in regulation text in comparison with the Proposed Rule.\n\n\n\n\nWe have reorganized the regulation text in response to comments requesting our regulatory\ntext in general be laid out in a way that is easier to use. For example, we have combined risks\narising from misidentified or mismatched EHI with other data-specific sources of risk of harm\nin the final § 171.201(c)(2), instead of splitting them across two paragraphs as was the case in\n§ 171.201(a)(1) (“corrupt or inaccurate” in the Proposed Rule) and § 171.201(a)(2)\n(“misidentified or mismatched” in the Proposed Rule). We believe this makes the finalized\ntext of § 171.201 easier to use because misidentified, mismatched, corrupt, and otherwise\nerroneous data are all sources of risk arising from issues with the data rather than\ncharacteristics unique to a patient or their circumstances. As was the case in the Proposed\nRule, additional conditions must be met for § 171.201 to apply to practices implemented to\nsubstantially reduce a risk of harm arising from data issues (consistent with § 171.201(c)(2)).\n\nIn the structure of the finalized regulation text, these additional conditions are found in §\n171.201(a) and (b), and as applicable in the particular circumstances also in (d)(3) or (4), and\n(f)(1) or (2). Whether (d)(3) or (d)(4) sets out the harm standard that applies to a practice an\nactor believes will substantially reduce a risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(2) turns on\nwhether the practice is likely to, or does, interfere with a patient’s own or another other legally\npermissible access, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI. (We note, however, that the harm\nrequired to satisfy this condition is the same under (d)(3) and (d)(4), as both cross-reference §\n164.524(a)(3)(i).) Whether (f)(1) or (f)(2) applies to a practice an actor believes will\nsubstantially reduce a risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(2) turns on whether the actor\nimplements the practice based on an organizational policy (f)(1) or a determination based on\nfacts and circumstances known or reasonably believed by the actor at the time the\ndetermination was made and while the practice remains in use (f)(2).\n\nDetermination by a licensed health care professional that the disclosure of EHI is\n\n\n\n\nreasonably likely to endanger life or physical safety (§ 171.201(c)(1))\nWe proposed that this exception would recognize practices interfering with EHI\naccess, exchange, or use in circumstances where a licensed health care professional has\ndetermined, in the exercise of professional judgment, that the access, exchange, or use of the\nEHI is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the patient or another person\n(84 FR 7524 and 7525). As we explained, the clinician may have in certain cases\nindividualized knowledge stemming from the clinician-patient relationship that, given the\nparticular patient and that patient’s circumstances, harm could result if certain EHI were\nshared or transmitted electronically. We proposed that, consistent with the HIPAA Privacy\nRule, a decision not to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI on this basis would be subject\nto any right that an affected individual is afforded under applicable Federal or State laws to\nhave the determination reviewed and potentially reversed.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended that actors, such as HINs/HIEs, implementing\npractices based on a determination by a health care professional, not be required to take steps\nto review or assess the reasonableness of the health care professional’s judgment or\ndetermination that a risk of harm exists or that the harm of which a risk was determined to\nexist met the standard for recognition under this exception.\n\n*Response.* We did not propose to require that other actors would ordinarily need to\nevaluate whether they agreed with individualized determinations of risk made by a licensed\nhealth care professional in order for the actor’s application of practices consistent with that\ndetermination to be recognized under this exception. The finalized exception also does not\ngenerally require that actors relying on an individualized determination made by a licensed\nhealth care professional in the exercise of professional judgment take steps to review or\n\n\n\n\nconfirm the health care professional’s judgment.158\nActors other than the licensed health care\nprofessional who makes the determination—including but not limited to HINs/HIEs or\nhospitals—could implement practices based on organizational policy (consistent with §\n171.201(f)(1) as finalized) to rely on such determinations upon becoming aware of the\ndetermination and until such time as they become aware that the determination has been\nreversed or revised. Such other actors also, either in absence of such policy or in particularized\nfacts or circumstances not fully covered by their existing policy at the time they became aware\nof a licensed health care professional’s individualized determination of risk, could\ndemonstrate for those particularized circumstances the reasonable belief required by §\n171.201(a) by referencing the licensed health care professional’s determination in making\ntheir own determination consistent with § 171.201(f)(2).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter suggested that this exception should recognize\ndeterminations of the existence of a risk of harm made by licensed health care professionals\nwithout requiring a clinician-patient relationship.\n\n*Response.* In order for practices implemented to substantially reduce a type of risk\nconsistent with finalized § 171.201(c)(1) to be excepted under § 171.201 from the definition\nof information blocking finalized in § 171.103, the individualized determination of risk of\nharm in the exercise of professional judgment must be made by a licensed health care\nprofessional who has a current or prior clinician-patient relationship with the patient whose\nEHI is affected by the determination. In the preamble to the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7524) we\nexplained that the clinician may have individualized knowledge stemming from the clinician-\n158\nTo the extent any particular actor may have an obligation under other Federal, state, or tribal law or regulations\n(as may be applicable in any particularized circumstances) to afford a patient a right of review of the determination –\nor to facilitate the patient’s requesting a review of the determination from another actor – the actor’s practices would\nneed to be in compliance with such law or regulations in order for this exception to apply to those practices.\n\n\n\n\npatient relationship that, for a particular patient and for that patient’s circumstances, harm\ncould result if certain EHI were shared or transmitted electronically. To ensure that both the\nrequirement for a clinician-patient relationship and its specificity to individualized\ndeterminations of risk of harm by licensed health care professionals in the exercise of\njudgment are immediately clear to all actors, we have stated it in the finalized text of §\n171.201(c)(1). We are finalizing this as a requirement because a clinician who has never\nestablished a clinician-patient relationship to the particular patient would not be expected to\nhave the same individualized knowledge of the individual patient and that patient’s\ncircumstances as one who has such a clinician-patient relationship.\n\nIn contrast, however, we reiterate that a risk is less individualized when it arises from\ndata issues (consistent with § 171.201(c)(2)) and as a result may be identified by clinicians or\nby other persons with relevant expertise, including but not limited to biomedical informaticists\nwho are not licensed health care professionals. Nothing in § 171.201 requires the involvement\nof a licensed health care professional with a clinician-patient relationship to any patient(s)\nwhose data may be affected by the practices in the design of, or decision to implement,\npractices an actor reasonably believes will substantially reduce a risk arising from data issues\nconsistent with § 171.201(c)(2).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that, in the context of a clinician-\npatient relationship, the clinician should have broader latitude to consider specifics of a\npatient’s circumstances in determining the existence of a risk of harm or potential harm.\n\n*Response.* It may be helpful to highlight the significant and broad discretion inherent\nin the policy as we proposed it. An individualized determination made in the exercise of\nprofessional judgment by a licensed health care professional allows for that professional to\nconsider a wide array of individual patient characteristics and circumstances and to apply all\n\n\n\n\nof the knowledge and skills within the licensed health care professional’s scope of practice.\n\nThe exception’s conditions as proposed would provide licensed health care professionals\nbroad discretion in how or why they form a reasonable belief that a cognizable risk of harm is\nassociated with particular access, exchange, or use of their patient’s EHI (including by the\npatient or their legal representative). We have finalized this aspect of the Preventing Harm\nException as proposed, though we have revised how the conditions, and specific requirements\nwithin particular conditions, are organized and phrased in regulation text. Nothing in the\nfinalized § 171.201 would limit the types of information on which the licensed health care\nprofessional may rely, or the factors they may consider, in exercising their professional\njudgment to make individualized determinations of risk of harm consistent with §\n171.201(c)(1).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters advocated for clinician discretion to determine whether\na disclosure of health information was in the patient’s best interest.\n\n*Response.* We believe an individual clinician’s assessment of the patient’s best interest\nis a less objective standard than one based on the exercise of professional judgment paired\nwith a defined standard of cognizable harm. It would thus render the exception more difficult\nto administer as well as more susceptible to inappropriate use of the exception. We are\nfinalizing the substance of this condition of the Preventing Harm Exception as proposed: to\nsatisfy the conditions of the Preventing Harm Exception, an individualized determination by a\nlicensed health care professional in the exercise of professional judgment must be that a risk of\nharm cognizable under this exception is associated with particular access, exchange, or use of\nthe patient’s EHI. The harm cognizable under this exception will be one that would be\nrecognized under § 164.524(a)(3)(i) (at this time, danger to the life or physical safety of the\npatient or another person) where a practice affects a patient’s access, exchange, or use of their\n\n\n\n\nEHI, per the finalized § 171.201(d)(3). Where § 171.201(d)(1) or § 171.201(d)(2) applies, the\nharm cognizable under this exception will be one that would be recognized under §\n164.524(a)(3)(iii) or § 164.524(a)(3)(ii), respectively. At this time, the harm standard in both §\n164.524(a)(3)(iii) and § 164.524(a)(3)(ii) is “substantial harm.” For all legally permissible\naccess, exchange, or use of the patient’s EHI to which § 171.201(d)(1) through (3) do not\napply, the finalized § 171.201(d)(4) applies, by cross-reference, the same § 164.524(a)(3)(i)\nharm standard of danger to the life or physical safety of the patient or another person that is\napplicable to practices interfering with the patient’s access to their own EHI (that does not\ninclude PII of another).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed a concern that the exception as proposed\nmight not sufficiently recognize the entire array of circumstances where persons should not be\ngranted access, exchange, or use of EHI. For instance, commenters suggested no access,\nexchange, or use of a patient’s EHI should be available to a person suspected to be abusing, or\nat risk of beginning to abuse, the patient. Commenters also suggested that the exception\nshould recognize that broader restrictions of EHI access than illustrated by examples in the\nProposed Rule would in many cases be indicated by available evidence, widely recognized\nclinical practice guidelines, or State laws applicable to instances of known or suspected child,\nintimate partner, elder, or other abuse.\n\n*Response.* This exception applies to practices the actor reasonably believes will\nsubstantially reduce a risk of harm determined on an individualized basis in the exercise of\nprofessional judgment by a licensed health care professional with a clinician-patient\nrelationship with the patient whose EHI is affected by the determination (finalized §\n171.201(c)(1)). Moreover, and as we noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7524), this exception\nwould apply when an actor implements practices that are likely to interfere with the access,\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use of a patient’s EHI pursuant to electing to not treat a person as a personal\nrepresentative in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(g)(5). We have finalized the substance of\nthis feature of the exception as proposed, though 45 CFR § 164.502(g)(5) is not expressly\nreferenced in the final regulation text.\n\nThe listed examples described in the Proposed Rule were intended to be illustrative,\nnot exhaustive. There are many other situations where the Preventing Harm Exception will\napply to an actor’s practices so long as the conditions of the exception are otherwise met. As\nanother illustrative example, if a determination of risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(1)\nindicates that a broad withholding of the patient’s EHI from a known, suspected, or potential\nabuser is reasonably likely to substantially reduce a risk of harm to the patient or another\nperson, then the exception will apply to those practices so long as its conditions are met in full.\n\nMoreover, provided its conditions are met in full, this exception will also apply to practices\nthat may be likely to, or do, interfere with a legal representative’s access, exchange, or use of a\npatient’s EHI to a lesser degree than might an election not to recognize the representative as\nthe patient’s personal representative in accordance with § 164.502(g)(5)(i). Because the\nfinalized § 171.201(d)(1) applies when a practice is likely to, or does, interfere with a legal\nrepresentative’s access to the patient’s EHI, the harm standard required in such a situation is\nthat stated in § 164.524(a)(3)(iii). Currently, that harm standard is “substantial harm.”\n\nWe also expressly note that, although the “substantial harm” standard applied by §\n171.201(d)(1) through cross-reference to § 164.524(a)(3)(iii) is not precisely the same as the\nrequirement in § 164.502(g)(5)(i), we will interpret as sufficient for purposes of §\n171.201(c)(1) and (d)(1) a licensed health care professional’s election not to treat a person as\nthe patient’s legal representative in accordance with § 164.502(g)(5)(i). Moreover, having\nnoted above the broad discretion licensed health care professionals have regarding what\n\n\n\n\ninformation to factor into their individualized determinations consistent with § 171.201(c)(1),\nwe highlight that this broad discretion would allow them to consider any knowledge they\nmight have of another licensed health care professional, or other type of covered entity, having\nelected in accordance with § 164.502(g)(5)(i) not to treat a person as the patient’s\nrepresentative.\n\n*Comments.* Some comments implied concerns about the potential conflict between the\ndocumentation requirements of this exception and those required under other applicable law.\n\n*Response.* Provided its conditions are met, this exception is applicable in\ncircumstances where a licensed health care professional in the exercise of professional\njudgment has determined that there is a risk of abuse beginning, as well as circumstances in\nwhich prior or ongoing abuse is known or suspected. Actors have significant discretion and\nflexibility in determining how best to document determinations and the bases for their\ndeterminations. Where other law or regulations—Federal, State, or tribal—require a specific\nform, manner, or content of documentation in circumstances that would serve as basis for\nindividualized determinations consistent with the finalized § 171.201(c)(1), we would\nconsider that documentation relevant to assessing the applicability of this exception to those\npractices. In order to avoid potentially duplicative or other unnecessary burdens on licensed\nhealth care professionals or other actors, we have decided not to establish at this time a\nspecific documentation condition and have decided not to establish other unique\ndocumentation requirements for this exception.\n\n*Comments.* In reference to a specific illustrative example in the Proposed Rule, one\ncommenter indicated that withholding or delaying availability of only specific sensitive data\nelements may not be sufficient in circumstances such as those described in the Proposed Rule\nexample, and that revoking a suspected abuser’s proxy access on the whole may be more\n\n\n\n\nclinically appropriate in such circumstances (84 FR 7525).\n\n*Response.* In response to this comment, we first clarify the intent and function of the\nexample provided in the Proposed Rule. In the example, the licensed health care professional\nin the exercise of professional judgment had determined that only some information within the\nrecord would need to be withheld from the patient’s partner’s proxy access to her EHI (84 FR\n7525). Although not specifically stated in the Proposed Rule, the example presumes a mature\ntechnical capability to sequester data from specific user(s) on an itemized basis. The example\nalso presumes that the licensed health care professional, in their exercise of professional\njudgment, had not formed a reasonable belief that ceasing to recognize the patient’s partner as\nher personal representative, and entirely revoking the partner’s proxy access to her EHI,\nwould substantially reduce a risk of harm to the patient. We intended that the example\nillustrate that where the licensed health care professional determined a risk of harm would\narise from making a specific piece of information accessible to the patient’s proxy, the\nminimum interference necessary to substantially reduce that risk of harm would be to\nwithhold that specific piece of information from the patient’s partner’s proxy access to her\nEHI.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter indicated that if a clinician has a suspicion (confirmed or\nnot) that the patient is suffering intimate partner or elder abuse, it is considered clinically\nimportant that notes or other data elements indicating the suspicion not be released to the\npatient in the company of the suspected abuser. The commenter stated that such disclosure\ncould undermine the clinician’s ability to help the patient because the patient would likely be\nforced to switch clinicians. The comment also indicated there may be a risk that an abuser\ncould harm the patient as a result of the disclosure of the clinician’s suspicion.\n\n*Response.* Because information blocking policy is specific to the access, exchange, and\n\n\n\n\nuse of EHI, we read the commenter’s example as suggesting two considerations specific to\naccess, exchange, and use of EHI. First, we believe the comment indicates we should\nexpressly acknowledge that these types of situations are often legally as well as clinically\ncomplex. It is not our intent that our policies unnecessarily add to this complexity. It is also\nnot our intent that our policies undermine the ability of a licensed health care professional, or\nother actor relying on the professional’s determination, to take appropriate steps to reduce\nabuse risks to which the professional’s patients would otherwise be exposed. Nothing in §\n171.201, or in the information blocking provisions generally, requires an actor to disclose their\nawareness or suspicion of abuse to the patient’s legal representative in order to satisfy the\nconditions of the Preventing Harm Exception. Second, our understanding of this comment\nindicates that in some particular individualized circumstances the licensed health care\nprofessional may determine in the exercise of professional judgment that to substantially\nreduce a risk of harm it may be necessary to withhold some portions of a patient’s EHI from\nthe patient’s own access through an API or patient portal. We can, for example, envision\npossible circumstances where a licensed health care professional with a clinician-patient\nrelationship to the patient knows or has reason to believe that a person suspected of abusing a\npatient routinely “looks over the shoulder” of the patient while they access their EHI, or uses\nthe patient’s own credentials to access the patient’s EHI. In such circumstances, this exception\nwould apply to practices interfering with the patient’s own access to their EHI to the extent the\npractices are not inconsistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the conditions in § 171.201.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters suggested that the Preventing Harm Exception should\nrecognize more types of abuse, and a broader array of potential types of harm than danger to\nlife or physical safety in the context of interfering with access to a patient’s EHI by a legal\nrepresentative suspected of abusing the patient. One commenter advocated that the Preventing\n\n\n\n\nHarm Exception should recognize all types of violence and abuse. The commenter provided\ncitations to professional specialty expert committee opinions in support of their\nrecommendation.\n\n*Response.* As discussed above in reference to comments that recommended aligning\nthis rule’s harm standards more closely to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we have, by cross-\nreference in § 171.201(d)(1), finalized as the harm standard applicable to practices interfering\nwith a legal representative’s access to a patient’s EHI the same harm standard that would\napply to denying a personal representative’s access to an individual’s PHI under §\n164.524(a)(3)(iii). As § 164.524(a)(3)(iii) stands at the time this rule is finalized, it references\n“substantial harm.” As discussed above, this exception will also apply to practices likely to\ninterfere with a legal representative’s access, exchange, or use that are employed pursuant to\nan election not to treat that legal representative as a personal representative in accordance with\n§ 164.502(g)(5)(i). For purposes of § 171.201, “substantial harm” is interpreted as it is for\npurposes of § 164.524(a)(3)(iii). Thus, for purposes of not recognizing a personal\nrepresentative, or otherwise restricting patient EHI access, exchange, or use by a\nrepresentative known or suspected to be abusing the patient, we believe the harm standard\napplicable under this exception to practices affecting a legal representative’s access, exchange,\nor use of the patient’s EHI is sufficiently broad. We interpret the discretion afforded to a\nlicensed health care professional in making an individualized determination of risk of harm\nconsistent with the finalized § 171.201(c)(1) (type of risk condition) as allowing them to take\ninto consideration clinical practice guidelines and clinical expert groups’ studied opinions\nrelevant to abuse-related risks of substantial harm. Only practices based on the potential for\nharms that would not be recognized as meeting the “substantial harm” standard, as it is\ninterpreted by the HHS Office for Civil Rights for purposes of § 164.524(a)(3)(iii), would fail\n\n\n\n\nto satisfy the type of harm condition finalized in § 171.201(d)(1). We remind actors that any\ndecision not to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI on the basis of determination of risk\nof harm consistent with the finalized § 171.201(c)(1) and § 171.201(d)(1), (2), (3), or (4) is\nsubject to rights the individual patient whose EHI is affected may be afforded by applicable\nregulations or law to have the determination reviewed and potentially reversed. (See the\n“patient right to request review of individualized determination of risk of harm” condition\nfinalized in § 171.201(e), for which we also use “patient review rights condition” as a short\nform of reference for ease of discussion.) Where § 164.524(a)(3) applies in addition to §\n171.201, § 164.524(a)(4) specifically provides for review of determinations made by licensed\nhealth care professionals in the exercise of professional judgment. In circumstances where §\n171.201 applies but § 164.524 does not, § 171.201(e) requires that an actor’s practices be\nconsistent with any rights of review of individualized determinations of risk of harm that the\npatient may be afforded under applicable Federal, State, or tribal law or regulations. However,\nfor purposes of § 171.201(c)(1) determinations, the type of harm must be consistent with: the\nharm standard stated in § 164.524(a)(3)(i) (interpreted as it is for purposes of §\n164.524(a)(3)(i)) where § 171.201(d)(3) or (4) apply; the harm standard stated in §\n164.524(a)(3)(ii) (interpreted as it is for purposes of § 164.524(a)(3)(ii)) where §\n171.201(d)(2) applies; or the harm standard stated in § 164.524(a)(3)(iii) (interpreted as it is\nfor purposes of § 164.524(a)(3)(iii)) where § 171.201(d)(1) applies.\n\nFinalized policy for an individualized determination of risk of harm by a licensed\nhealth care professional in the exercise of professional judgment.\n\nWe are finalizing the substance of this aspect of the exception with modifications to\nthe way it is displayed and phrased in the finalized regulation text in comparison to the\nProposed Rule. If its other conditions are also met, the finalized Preventing Harm Exception\n\n\n\n\nwill apply to a practice an actor reasonably believes will substantially reduce a risk of harm\nconsistent with the sub-paragraph of § 171.201(d), as finalized, that applies to the specific\naccess, exchange, or use, where the risk of harm is determined on an individualized basis in\nthe exercise of professional judgment by a licensed health care professional who has a current\nor prior clinician-patient relationship with the patient whose EHI is affected by the\ndetermination. In comparison to the proposed text of § 171.201 (84 FR 7602), we have\nreorganized the regulation text in response to comments requesting our regulatory text, in\ngeneral, be easier to use for purposes such as understanding how the conditions of the\nexception relate to one another and how they apply to practices used in particular types of\ncircumstances. We have left the potential sources of risk of harm in a single paragraph\n(finalized § 171.201(c)), but separated them from the reasonable belief condition paragraph\n(finalized § 171.201(a)). The sources of risk of harm are also, as discussed above, presented in\ntwo sub-paragraphs in the finalized text of § 171.201(c) (type of harm) instead of being split\nacross three sub-paragraphs as they were in the Proposed Rule.\n\nIn subparagraph (a)(3) of the proposed text of § 171.201 (84 FR 7602), we expressed\nthe additional condition that practices based on individualized determinations of risk of harm\nare subject to any rights of review of the determination that the patient may be afforded under\napplicable law. This patient review rights condition is finalized in § 171.201(e). As finalized,\nthis condition requires that where a risk of harm is determined on an individualized basis\n(consistent with § 171.201(c)(1) as finalized), the actor must honor any rights the individual\npatient whose EHI is affected may have under § 164.524(a)(4) or any Federal, State, or tribal\nlaw applicable in the circumstances to have the determination reviewed and potentially\nreversed. We have stated the condition for providing review rights afforded by law in the\nseparate paragraph (e) of § 171.201 instead of including it within subparagraph (c)(1) because\n\n\n\n\nin the context of 171.201 the patient review rights condition functions as a condition on how\npractices based on such belief are implemented more than as a required characteristic of the §\n171.201(c)(1) determination itself.\n\nThe finalized text of § 171.201(c)(1) also differs from the proposed regulation text\nspecific to individualized determinations of risk in explicitly stating the requirement that the\nlicensed health care professional making the determination must have a current or prior\nclinician-patient relationship with the patient whose EHI is affected by the determination. For\npurposes of § 171.201 — as we discussed in the Proposed Rule’s preamble, and above in this\npreamble — we believe the broad discretion afforded to licensed health care professionals to\nmake individualized determinations of risks of harm in the exercise of professional judgment\nis appropriate in the context of the expectation that a licensed health care professional with a\nclinician-patient relationship to a patient has the opportunity to have knowledge of the patient\nand their individual circumstances that is not generally available outside the context of a\nclinician-patient relationship. We believe that explicitly stating in § 171.201(c)(1) the\nrequirement for a clinician-patient relationship accomplishes two purposes: first, it ensures\nthat this is immediately clear on the face of the finalized regulation text that only\ndeterminations made by licensed health care professionals who have or have had a clinician-\npatient relationship with the patient will be considered consistent with § 171.201(c)(1); and,\nsecond, it is also clear that the condition for a clinician-patient relationship is specific and\nlimited to determinations of risks of harm on an individualized basis in the exercise of\nprofessional judgment by a licensed health care professional (§ 171.201(c)(1) as finalized).\n\nPlease note that this requirement is specific to the individualized determination of risk of\nharm, and does not limit application of § 171.201 to practices implemented directly by the\nlicensed health care professional making a determination of risk of harm consistent with §\n\n\n\n\n171.201(c)(1) as finalized. Appropriately tailored practices applied because the actor has a\nreasonable belief the practice will substantially reduce a risk of harm that was determined on\nan individualized basis consistent with § 171.201(c)(1) will, if all other applicable conditions\nof § 171.201 are met, be recognized under this exception whether the practices are undertaken\nby the licensed health care professional making the determination or by another actor (e.g.,\nanother licensed health care professional, a hospital, or a HIN) having custody or control of\nthe patient’s EHI and knowledge of the individualized determination of risk of harm\nassociated with particular access(es), exchange(s), or use(s) of that EHI.\n\nAs finalized, § 171.201(d) differs from the proposed policy in that it does not\nuniformly require that the risk determined on an individualized basis be to life or physical\nsafety of the patient or another person in all circumstances. Instead, through specified cross-\nreferences to the sub-paragraphs of § 164.524(a)(3), the finalized § 171.201(d) type of harm\ncondition uses the same harm standards for the circumstances where both the Preventing\nHarm Exception and § 164.524(a)(3) apply. Also through cross-references, the type of harm\ncondition applies the § 164.524(a)(3) harm standards in circumstances similar to those in\nwhich § 164.524(a)(3) applies but where only § 171.201 actually applies. The finalized §\n171.201(d) does not cross-reference § 164.502(g)(5)(i), but it is constructed so that it does\napply to practices interfering with a personal representative or other legal representative’s\naccess to a patient’s EHI consistent with an actor declining to recognize such a representative\non the same bases as a HIPAA covered entity could elect not to recognize a person as an\nindividual’s personal representative consistent with § 164.502(g)(5)(i). In order to retain a\nclear, consistent set of harm standards throughout the § 171.201 type of harm condition,\nhowever, we note that where a HIPAA covered entity elects not to recognize an individual’s\npersonal representative consistent with § 164.502(g)(5)(ii), the Preventing Harm Exception\n\n\n\n\nwould not apply.159\nConsistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a decision not to provide access, exchange,\nor use of EHI on the basis finalized in § 171.201(c)(1) is subject to the rights the individual\npatient whose EHI is affected may be afforded by applicable law to have the determination\nreviewed and potentially reversed. While any such determination reviews may be pending,\napplication of practices interfering with the patient’s access, exchange, or use of their EHI\nbased on an individualized determination by a licensed health care professional (§ 171.201(c))\nthat are otherwise compliant with the conditions of § 171.201 as a whole will be considered to\nbe covered by the exception.\n\nUpon becoming aware of a reversal of the determination on which the actor’s required\nreasonable belief was based, whether as a result of a review requested by the patient or other\nprocesses, the actor’s continued application of practices based on the original determination\nwould no longer be consistent with the conditions of § 171.201. Likewise, upon becoming\naware of a revision of the determination on which the actor’s required reasonable belief was\noriginally based, whether the revision resulted from a review requested by the patient or other\nprocesses, practices applied to the patient’s EHI after the revision is made will need to comply\nwith the conditions of § 171.201 in light of the revised determination in order for the practice\nto continue to be covered under § 171.201.\n\nFor the specific purposes of § 171.201, the rights to obtain review or reconsideration\nof a provider’s individualized determination of risk of harm reside with the patient whose EHI\nis affected. The rights in many cases may be exercised on the patient’s behalf by the patient’s\n159\nBecause § 164.502(g)(5)(ii) currently applies a standard not of harm but of determination by the covered entity\nthat recognizing a person as personal representative is not in the best interest of the individual, we have determined\nit is more appropriate to address these circumstances in context of the exception for practices promoting privacy of\nEHI, finalized in § 171.202 and discussed in Section VIII.D.1.b of this final rule preamble.\n\n\n\n\npersonal or other legal representative. However, it may not be appropriate, or feasible, for the\npatient’s representative to exercise the patient’s review rights in circumstances where the\nindividualized determination of risk of harm is or includes a determination that recognizing\nthat same person as the patient’s representative, or providing specific information to that same\nrecognized representative, would pose a risk of cognizable harm. In a circumstance where the\nactor has a reasonable belief that such disclosure could create or increase a risk of harm to the\npatient, this exception does not require the candid disclosure to a known, suspected, or\npotential abuser of the rationale for use of particular practices, or even the precise practices,\ninterfering with that representative’s access, exchange, or use of EHI. We would, however,\ngenerally expect actors to be as candid with the patient per se as is clinically appropriate and\nsafely practicable in their individualized circumstances.\n\nWhere an actor lacks the technical capability to sequester only that EHI the actor\nreasonably believes poses a risk of cognizable harm from other data for which the actor does\nnot pose such risk of harm, this lack of segmentation capability would not render § 171.201\napplicable to practices likely to, or that do, interfere with access, exchange, or use of the other\ndata. Rather, where such lack of segmentation capabilities renders the actor unable to support\nan otherwise legally permissible access, exchange, or use of EHI, the actor should reference\nthe Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301) or the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204).\n\nLicensed health care professionals have discretion to determine how to use their EHRs\nand/or other records kept in their ordinary course of business to capture and preserve\ndocumentation of and relevant to their individualized determinations. Information relevant to\ndeterminations would include the facts or circumstances that substantially informed each\ndetermination, and any other decision-making information that the professional may otherwise\nhave difficulty recalling or reconstructing if later asked to explain how or why they reached\n\n\n\n\ntheir individualized determination in a particular case.\n\nPractices implemented based on an organizational policy or on determination specific\nto the facts and circumstances.\n\nTo qualify for the Preventing Harm Exception, we proposed that an actor would be\nrequired to have, while engaging in the practice(s) for which application of the exception is\nclaimed, a reasonable belief that the practice(s) will “directly and substantially” 160\nreduce the\nlikelihood of harm to a patient or another person. As discussed in the Proposed Rule and\nabove, the type of risk and the potential harm must also be cognizable under this exception (84\nFR 7525 and 7526).\n\nUnder § 171.201 as proposed, an actor would be able to demonstrate having satisfied\nthe condition of reasonable belief that a practice will reduce the likelihood of harm\n(“reasonable belief condition”) through a qualifying organizational policy (proposed §\n171.201(b)) and/or a qualifying individualized determination (proposed § 171.201(c)). We\ndiscuss below the details of our proposal, respond to comments, and summarize finalized\npolicy specific to each of these approaches to demonstrating the required reasonable belief that\na practice will substantially161\nreduce a risk of harm cognizable under this exception.\n\nPractices implemented based on an organizational policy\nIn the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7525), we proposed that to qualify for this exception, an\nactor must have had a reasonable belief that the practice or practices will directly and\nsubstantially reduce the likelihood of harm to a patient or another person and that the type of\n160\nAs, and for the reasons, discussed earlier in this section of this preamble, we have removed “directly and” from\nthe belief standard finalized in § 171.201(a).\n\n161\nAs, and for the reasons, discussed earlier in this section of this preamble, the belief standard finalized in §\n171.201(a) requires the actor believe the practice will “substantially reduce” a risk of harm to a patient or another\nnatural person that would otherwise arise from the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information affected\nby the practice.\n\n\n\n\nrisk must also be cognizable under this exception. We proposed that an actor could meet this\ncondition in two ways: through a “qualifying organizational policy” (§ 171.201(b) as\nproposed) or through a “qualifying individualized finding” (§ 171.201(c) as proposed). We\nstated in the Proposed Rule that we anticipate that in most instances where § 171.201 would\napply, the actor would demonstrate that the practices it engaged in were consistent with an\norganizational policy that was objectively reasonable and no broader than necessary for the\ntype of patient safety risks at issue. We also noted in the Proposed Rule that within any type of\nactor defined in § 171.102, organizations may vary significantly in structure, size, and\nresources. Further, even when an organizational policy exists, it may not anticipate all of the\npotential risks of harm that could arise in real-world clinical or production environments of\nhealth IT. Thus, we proposed in § 171.201(c) (84 FR 7602) that in lieu of demonstrating that a\npractice conformed to a policy that met the conditions described in proposed § 171.201(b) and\nthe Proposed Rule preamble at 84 FR 7525, the actor could justify the practice(s) directly by\nmaking a finding in each case, based on the particularized facts and circumstances.\n\nWe proposed that where the proposed § 171.201(b) (84 FR 7602) would apply, an\nactor’s policy would need to be:\n in writing;\n developed with meaningful input from clinical, technical, and other appropriate\nstaff or others who have expertise or insight relevant to the risk of harm that\nthe policy addresses;\n implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner; and\n no broader than necessary to mitigate the risk of harm.\n\nWe stated that the proposed condition would not be met if, for example, a hospital\n\n\n\n\nimposed top-down information sharing policies or workflows established by the hospital’s\nEHR developer and approved by hospital administrators without meaningful input from the\nmedical staff, IT department, and front-line clinicians who are in the best position to gauge\nhow effective it will be at mitigating patient safety risks.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concern that information blocking policy and its\ninteraction with other applicable laws and regulations, such as the HIPAA Rules, are complex\nand that there will be costs and other burden associated with understanding how the policies\naffect an actor’s daily operations. Commenters also expressed concern that it would be too\nburdensome to be required to demonstrate, in any of the ways we proposed, that they have a\nreasonable belief that practices would reduce a risk of cognizable harm.\n\n*Response.* We understand that complexity can increase difficulty in understanding and\ncomplying with any regulation. We also understand that the interaction between the HIPAA\nRules and the information blocking provision is inherently complex. However, without an\nexception from the information blocking definition for practices appropriately tailored to\nreduce risks of harm, we believe actors would be subject to the greater burden of needing to\ncraft practices that avoid violating the information blocking provision without also making\nEHI available for access, exchange, or use in circumstances where that puts patients or other\nnatural persons at risk of harm. This exception’s conditions give actors a framework within\nwhich they can develop or refine their practices in assurance that practices meeting the\nconditions in § 171.201 are excepted from the definition of information blocking finalized in §\n171.103. At the same time, implementing such an exception without appropriate conditions\ncould have the unintended and undesirable effect of excusing conduct that would more\nappropriately remain within the definition of information blocking.\n\nTherefore, in § 171.201, we have finalized conditions that strike a practical balance\n\n\n\n\nbetween minimizing burdens on actors and ensuring that the interests of patients in the access,\nexchange, and use of their EHI are adequately protected. These conditions are, in comparison\nto the Proposed Rule, more granularly and durably aligned with relevant HIPAA right of\naccess provisions (§ 164.526(a)(3)) and this alignment reduces complexity.\n\nWe have revised the way the regulation text is presented and phrased so that it is easier\nto understand what is required in order for a practice to be excepted from the definition of\ninformation blocking under this exception. Moreover, we have avoided specifying particular\nor unique forms, methods, or content of documentation for purposes of this exception. We\nbelieve the flexibility this offers actors to determine the most efficient approach to\ndocumenting their practices and determinations relevant to this exception enables them to\nachieve and document satisfaction of the exception’s condition with the lowest practicable\nburden.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters noted that there will be burden associated with\ndeveloping or revising organizational policies and training staff so they can use this exception\nin compliance with its conditions. Several of these commenters suggested we provide\nadditional guidance and informational resources, in this final rule or otherwise, to help actors\ndevelop their policies and staff training. Some commenters advocated that we develop\ntemplates or models that actors could use to more efficiently develop policies consistent with\nthe conditions for applicability of this exception.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and do recognize that developing or revising\ninternal policies and procedures when compliance requirements change due to changes in law\nrequires some effort. While recognizing the utility of the types of resource materials suggested\nby commenters, we believe they are best developed and provided outside the rulemaking\nprocess. We will continue working to engage with the stakeholder communities to promote\n\n\n\n\nunderstanding and foster compliance with the information blocking provision amongst all\nactors within the definitions in § 171.102. We also believe that in many cases voluntary\ngroups with relevant expertise, such as professional societies and provider organizations, may\nbe in the best position to develop resources tailored to the particular needs and preferences of\nspecific segments or communities within any given type of actor.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stating that developing new or revised organizational\npolicies and training staff in the policies requires time recommended that we establish a grace\nperiod before organizations’ policies and actual practices must fully comply with § 171.201\nconditions in order to be recognized as reasonable and necessary under § 171.201.\n\n*Response.* This concern is not unique to § 171.201. Commenters also raised this\nconcern in the context of information blocking in general. As we stated in section VIII.B.3 of\nthis preamble, we thank commenters for their input. Comments related to the overall timing of\ninformation blocking enforcement have been shared with OIG. We emphasize that individuals\nand entities subject to the information blocking provision must comply with the ONC final\nrule as of the compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR\npart 171). We have finalized a compliance date for 45 CFR part 171 as a whole that is six\nmonths after the date this final rule is published in the Federal Register.\n\nOIG and ONC are coordinating timing of the compliance date of the information blocking\nsection of this final rule (45 CFR part 171) and the start of information blocking enforcement.\n\nWe are providing the following information on timing for actors. Enforcement of information\nblocking CMPs in section 3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA will not begin until established by future\nnotice and comment rulemaking by OIG. As a result, actors would not be subject to penalties until\nCMP rules are final. At a minimum, the timeframe for enforcement would not begin sooner than\nthe compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule (45 CFR part 171) and\n\n\n\n\nwill depend on when the CMP rules are final. Discretion will be exercised such that conduct that\noccurs before that time will not be subject to information blocking CMP.\n\nSpecific to § 171.201, as discussed above in response to other comments received\nspecific to the Preventing Harm Exception, we have applied § 164.524(a)(3) harm standards\nunder § 171.201 to circumstances where both sections of 45 CFR would apply, and to\ncircumstances where only § 171.201 applies but that are similar in significant respects to\ncircumstances where § 164.524(a)(3) applies. In substantial part because of this alignment, we\ndo not believe there is a need to delay the applicability of any of the conditions for a practice\nto be excepted under § 171.201 from the definition of information blocking in § 171.103.\n\nActors who are also HIPAA covered entities or business associates should already\nhave policies in place consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including but not limited to §\n164.524(a)(3). These actors and their staff members should be well versed in these policies\nand practices. Where § 164.524(a)(3) would not apply but § 171.201(d)(3) or (4) would apply,\nwe believe using the same, familiar standard for the risk that the actor must believe their\npractice would reduce as would apply to § 164.524(a)(3)(i) should facilitate efficient updates\nto organizational policies and streamline any staff training that may be indicated specific to §\n171.201. We also note that the finalized Preventing Harm Exception also provides, in §\n171.201(f)(2), for coverage of practices implemented in absence of an applicable\norganizational policy or where existing organizational policy does not address the particular\npractice in the particularized circumstances. Moreover, although we encourage actors to\nvoluntarily conform their practices to the conditions of an exception suited to the practice and\nits purpose, an actor’s choice to do so simply provides them an enhanced level of assurance\nthat the practices do not meet the definition of information blocking. However, failure to meet\nan exception does not necessarily mean a practice meets the definition of information\n\n\n\n\nblocking. We reiterate, if subject to an investigation by HHS, each practice that implicates the\ninformation blocking provision would be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters indicated that providers’ current organizational\npolicies call for practices that delay the release of laboratory results so that the patient’s\nclinician has an opportunity to review the results before potentially needing to respond to\npatient questions, or has an opportunity to communicate the results to the patient in a way that\nbuilds the clinician-patient relationship. Some commenters indicated their standard practice is\nto automatically time-delay release of results in general, with an automatic release at the end\nof a time period determined by the organizational policy in place to ensure that patients can\nconsistently access their information within the timeframe targeted by relevant measures\nunder the CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs. Commenters requested we clarify\nwhether such practices would be recognized under § 171.201 or that we recognize such\ncurrent organizational policies and practices as excepted from the definition of information\nblocking.\n\n*Response.* While we recognize the importance of effective clinician-patient\nrelationships and patient communications, we are not persuaded that routinely time-delaying\nthe availability of broad classes of EHI should be recognized as excepted from the information\nblocking definition under this exception. Consistent with § 171.201(d)(3) as finalized, the\nharm of which a practice must reduce a risk must, where the practice interferes with the\npatient’s access to their own EHI, be one that could justify denying the patient’s right of\naccess to PHI under § 164.524(a)(3). Currently, § 164.524(a)(3)(i) requires that for a covered\nentity to deny an individual access to their PHI within the designated record set, the disclosure\nof that PHI must be reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the patient or\n\n\n\n\nanother person.162\nNo commenter cited evidence that routinely delaying EHI availability to\npatients in the interest of fostering clinician-patient relationships substantially reduces danger\nto life or physical safety of patients or other persons that would otherwise routinely arise from\npatients’ choosing to access the information as soon as it is finalized.\n\nMoreover, we are independently aware, and some comment submissions confirmed,\nthat it is not uncommon to automatically release lab and other findings to patients\nelectronically regardless of whether a clinician has seen the information or discussed it with\nthe patient before the patient can choose to access it electronically. We presume these types of\nautomatic releases would not be the case if patients’ accessing their information on a\ntimeframe that is more of their own choosing routinely posed a risk to the life or physical\nsafety of these patients or other natural persons. Thus, we believe that where applicable law\ndoes not prohibit making particular information available to a patient electronically before it\nhas been conveyed in another way, deference should generally be afforded to patients’ right to\nchoose whether to access their data as soon as it is available or wait for the provider to contact\nthem to discuss their results. Only in specific circumstances do we believe delaying patients’\naccess to their health information so that providers retain full control over when and how it is\ncommunicated could be both necessary and reasonable for purposes of substantially reducing\na risk of harm cognizable under § 171.201(d) (as finalized). Circumstances where § 171.201\nwould apply to such delay are those where a licensed health care professional has made an\nindividualized determination of risk in the exercise of professional judgment consistent with §\n171.201(c)(1), whether the actor implementing the practice is the licensed health care\n162\nNote that for purposes of § 164.524(a)(3)(i), “individual” is defined in § 160.103, but for purposes of § 171.201\nan actor must reasonably believe a practice will substantially reduce a risk of cognizable harm to patient(s) or other\nnatural person(s).\n\n\n\n\nprofessional acting directly on their own determination or another actor implementing the\ndelay in reliance on that determination. An actor could choose to demonstrate the reasonable\nbelief required by § 171.201(a) through an organizational policy (§ 171.201(f)(1)) with which\nthe practice is consistent, or based on a determination based on facts and circumstances known\nor reasonably believed by the actor at the time the determination was made and while the\npractice remains in use (§ 171.201(f)(2)), to rely on a determination consistent with §\n171.201(c)(1).\n\n*Comments.* Health care professionals commented that clinical experience indicates a\nsystematic and substantial risk that releasing some patient data through a patient portal or API\nwithout first communicating the particular results or diagnosis with the patient in a more\ninteractive venue would pose risks of substantial harm to patients. One example commenters\nspecifically cited was genetic testing results indicating a high risk of developing a\nneurodegenerative disease for which there is no effective treatment or cure. Commenters\nrecommended that we define this exception to allowing delay of the electronic release of such\ngenetic testing results, as a matter of organizational policy, to ensure patients and their\nfamilies are not exposed to this information without appropriate counseling and context. One\ncomment indicated that delivery by the clinician of the combined results, counseling, and\ncontext is clinically appropriate and consistent with the conclusions of relevant research.\n\n*Response.* To satisfy the conditions of § 171.201, and actor would have to demonstrate\nthat they held a reasonable belief that delaying availability of information until the information\ncan be delivered in combination with appropriate counseling and context in an interactive\nvenue will substantially reduce a risk of harm cognizable under this exception. An actor could\naccomplish such demonstration through showing the practice is consistent with either an\norganizational policy meeting § 171.201(f)(1) or a determination based on facts and\n\n\n\n\ncircumstances known or reasonably believed by the actor at the time the determination was\nmade and while the practice remains in use meeting § 171.201(f)(2). However, for a practice\nlikely to, or that does in fact, interfere with the patient’s access to their own EHI (§\n171.201(d)(3)), the actor implementing these practices must demonstrate a reasonable belief\nthat the practice will substantially reduce a risk of harm to the life or physical safety of the\npatient. The clinician who orders testing of the sort referenced in the comment would, we\npresume, do so in the context of a clinician-patient relationship. In the context of that\nrelationship, a licensed health care professional should be well positioned to make\ndeterminations consistent with § 171.201(c)(1) as to specifically when their patients, or other\nparticular natural persons, would face a risk of harm cognizable under § 171.201(d)(3) — or §\n171.201(d)(1) or (2) if or as may be applicable — if the access, exchange, or use of a\nparticular testing result or diagnosis were to be released electronically before it could be\nexplained and contextualized by an appropriately skilled professional, such as a clinician or a\nhealth educator, in real time.\n\nSummary of finalized policy: practices implemented based on an organizational policy\nWe have finalized that to demonstrate the reasonable belief required by § 171.201(a)\nbased on an organizational policy, the policy must:\n(i) Be in writing;\n(ii) Be based on relevant clinical, technical, and other appropriate expertise;\n(iii) Be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner;\n(iv) Conform each practice to the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this\nsection, as well as the conditions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section\napplicable to the practice and its use.\n\nWe have modified the regulation text finalized in § 171.201(f)(1) consistent with other\n\n\n\n\nrevisions to § 171.201. We have redesignated this paragraph from (b) to (f)(1), and\nredesignated its proposed sub-paragraphs from (1) through (4) to (i) through (iv). We have in\ncomparison to the main paragraph language of the proposed § 171.201(b) modified the\nphrasing of the finalized paragraph (f) so that § 171.201 as finalized is more immediately clear\non its face that what is finalized in § 171.201(f) is a condition for practices to meet the\nexception, and that paragraph (f) can be satisfied by meeting either subparagraph (1) or (2).\n\nPractices applied based on an organization policy to rely on individualized\ndeterminations of risk of harm consistent with § 171.201(c)(1) would be covered under §\n171.201 to the extent they otherwise meets its conditions. Neither an organizational policy (§\n171.201(f)(1)), nor a determination based on facts and circumstances known or reasonably\nbelieved by the actor at the time the determination was made and while the practice remains in\nuse ((§ 171.201(f)(2)) would be required to routinely evaluate or otherwise assess the licensed\nhealth care professional’s exercise of professional judgment in order for practices\nimplemented in reliance on the professional’s § 171.201(c)(1) determination to be meet the\nconditions of § 171.201.\n\nPractices implemented based on a determination specific to the facts and\ncircumstances\nAs discussed in the Proposed Rule, we recognize that some actors (such as small\nhealth care providers and small HINs/HIEs) may not have comprehensive and formal policies\ngoverning all aspects of EHI and patient safety. Additionally, even if an organizational policy\nexists, it may not anticipate all of the potential risks of harm that could arise in real-world\nclinical or production environments of health IT. In these circumstances, in lieu of\ndemonstrating that a practice conformed to the actor’s policies and that the policies met the\nconditions proposed in § 171.201(b), we proposed that the actor could justify its use of\n\n\n\n\nparticular practices by making a finding in each case, based on the particularized facts and\ncircumstances, that the practice is necessary and no broader than necessary to mitigate the risk\nof harm. To do so, we proposed that the actor would need to show that the practices were\napproved on a case-by-case basis by an individual with direct knowledge of the relevant facts\nand circumstances and who had relevant clinical, technical, or other appropriate expertise.\n\nSuch an individual would need to reasonably conclude, based on those particularized facts and\ncircumstances and his/her expertise and best professional judgment, that the practice was\nnecessary, and no broader than necessary, to mitigate the risk of harm to a patient or other\npersons. We further proposed that a licensed health care professional’s independent and\nindividualized judgment about the safety of the actor’s patients or other persons would be\nentitled to substantial deference under this proposed exception. So long as the clinician\nconsidered the relevant facts and determined that, under the particular circumstances, the\npractice was necessary to protect the safety of the clinician’s patient or another natural person,\nwe would not second-guess the clinician’s professional judgment. To provide further clarity\non this point, we provided an illustrative example in the preamble to the proposed rule (see 84\nFR 7525).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested that we clarify, provide guidance, or establish\nspecifications for the documentation necessary to substantiate applicability of the Preventing\nHarm Exception based on qualifying determinations particularized to specific facts and\ncircumstances. Some commenters indicated that such specificity or guidance is needed to\navoid imposing on actors such as health care providers and HINs/HIEs excess burden\nassociated with documentation in the absence of such guidance or specification.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these commenters highlighting that the potential for\nuncertainty or confusion about what is minimally necessary to demonstrate satisfaction of a\n\n\n\n\nnew policy can often lead to capturing and retaining a wide array of information just in case it\nmay be needed or useful later. We have clarified the way in which all of the conditions in §\n171.201 are stated and organized within the section. We also note here that an actor does not\nneed to draft for each determination consistent with § 171.201(f)(2) a comprehensive defense\nof their findings. We believe the finalized statement of the condition, reinforced by this\npreamble discussion, provides certainty that we do not intend or expect actors to create new\nrecords systems or types, or to create or retain duplicate information or documentation across\ntheir current medical and other business records. Ultimately, it is the actor’s responsibility to\ndemonstrate they met the conditions of an exception.\n\nSummary of finalized policy: practices implemented based on a determination specific\nto the facts and circumstances\nWe have finalized the substance of this condition as proposed, with modifications to\nthe regulation text. We have also reorganized § 171.201 so that it is easier to read and\nunderstand. We have redesignated this paragraph from (c) to (f), and broken it into\nsubparagraphs. We have in comparison to the main paragraph language of the proposed §\n171.201(c) modified the phrasing of the finalized paragraph (f) so that § 171.201 as finalized\nis more immediately clear on its face that what is finalized in § 171.201(f)(2) is a means to\ndemonstrate a practice implemented in absence of an applicable, or perhaps any,\norganizational policy nevertheless meets the conditions to be exempted under § 171.201 from\nthe definition of information blocking in § 171.103.\n\nWe have separated from both the requirements applicable to individualized\ndeterminations of risk (finalized in the type of risk condition in § 171.201(c)(1)) and the\nrequirements applicable to practices implemented based on organizational policy (§\n171.201(f)(1)) or to practices implemented pursuant to a determination based on the facts and\n\n\n\n\ncircumstances (§ 171.201(f)(2)) the patient review rights condition expressed in subparagraph\n(a)(3) of the proposed text of § 171.201 (84 FR 7602). We have finalized the patient review\nrights condition in § 171.201(e) instead of the finalized (f) because it applies equally to\npractices implemented based on an organizational policy and by practices implemented based\non determinations based on facts and circumstances, in parallel to the other conditions for a\npractice to be excepted under § 171.201 from the definition of information blocking in §\n171.103.\n\nIn the finalized patient review rights condition (§ 171.201(e)), in comparison with\nproposed § 171.201(a)(3) (84 FR 7602), we have revised the wording in which we state the\ncondition for honoring any rights that applicable law may afford patients to have these\nindividualized determinations reviewed and potentially reversed. The condition finalized in §\n171.201(e) is that where the risk of harm is consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the\nactor must implement its practices in a manner consistent with any rights the individual patient\nwhose EHI is affected may have under § 164.524(a)(4) of this title, or any Federal, State, or\ntribal law, to have the determination reviewed and potentially reversed.\n\nWe also revised in finalized § 171.201(e), in comparison with the proposed §\n171.201(a)(3), the wording of the condition finalized in § 171.201(e) in comparison to the\nwording of this condition as proposed in 171.201(a)(3) for two reasons. First, the wording has\nbeen revised to fit its placement within the finalized section. Second, the wording has been\nrevised to more clearly and completely state the sources of the review rights that must be\nafforded, if applicable. We note that such review rights will be afforded by § 164.524(a)(4) in\nthe circumstances where both § 164.524(a)(3) and § 171.201 apply. However, rights that must\nbe honored to meet the conditions of § 171.201 are not limited to those afforded by §\n164.24(a)(4) or to circumstances where § 164.524 applies in addition to § 171.201. Rights of\n\n\n\n\nreview of an individualized determination of risk of harm (§ 171.201(c)(1)) might also be\nafforded by Federal, State, or tribal law applicable in the particular circumstances.\n\nWe do not believe it is necessary to expressly state in the regulation text that we\ninterpret regulations promulgated based on such laws, and that have the force and effect of law\non individuals and entities they regulate, to be within the meaning of “law” for purposes of §\n171.201(e). However, we expressly state this here in order to provide the type of assurance we\nbelieve many commenters were seeking when stating in their comment submissions requests\nor recommendations for additional guidance in the final rule. In order for the practice(s) to\nsatisfy the condition in § 171.201(e), where otherwise applicable law affords a patient right(s)\nto request review of individualized determinations of risk of harm associated with the patient’s\naccess, exchange, or use of their EHI, the actor’s practice(s) be implemented in a manner\nconsistent with those rights—regardless of which specific law(s) afford the rights applicable in\nthe particular circumstances.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed to establish an exception to the information blocking provision for\npractices that are reasonable and necessary to protect the privacy of an individual’s EHI,\nprovided certain conditions are met (84 FR 7526). The exception and corresponding\nconditions were set forth in the proposed regulation text in § 171.202. We noted that any\ninterference practice that an actor is engaged in to protect the privacy of an individual’s EHI\nmust be consistent with applicable laws and regulations related to health information privacy,\nincluding the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the HITECH Act, 42 CFR part 2, and State laws. We\nemphasized that this exception to the information blocking provision does not alter an actor’s\n\n\n\n\nobligation to comply with applicable laws (84 FR 7526).\n\nWe noted that this exception is necessary to support basic trust and confidence in\nhealth IT infrastructure. Without this exception, there would be a significant risk that actors\nwould share EHI in inappropriate circumstances, such as when an individual has taken\naffirmative steps to request that the EHI not be shared under certain conditions or when an\nactor has been unable to verify a requester’s identity before sharing EHI.\n\nWe explained that this proposed exception was structured with discrete “sub-\nexceptions.” An actor’s practice must qualify for a sub-exception to be covered by the\nexception. We noted that the sub-exceptions were, to a large extent, crafted to closely mirror\nprivacy-protective practices that are recognized under State and Federal privacy laws. In this\nway, the privacy sub-exceptions to the information blocking provision recognize as reasonable\nand necessary those practices that are engaged in by actors to be consistent with existing laws,\nprovided that certain conditions are met.\n\nWe proposed four sub-exceptions that address the following privacy protective\npractices: (1) not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI when a State or Federal law\nrequires that a precondition be satisfied before an actor provides access, exchange, or use of\nEHI, and the precondition is not satisfied (proposed in § 171.202(b)); (2) not providing access,\nexchange, or use of EHI when the actor is a health IT developer of certified health IT that is\nnot covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule in respect to a practice (proposed in § 171.202(c));\n(3) a covered entity, or a business associate on behalf of a covered entity, denying an\nindividual’s request to access to their electronic protected health information (ePHI) in the\ncircumstances provided in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1)(2) or (3) (proposed in § 171.202(d)); and (4)\nnot providing access, exchange, or use of EHI pursuant to an individual’s request, in certain\nsituations (proposed in § 171.202(e)) (84 FR 7526).\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed that an actor would need to satisfy at least one sub-exception with\nrespect to a purportedly privacy-protective practice that interferes with access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI to not be subject to the information blocking provision. Each proposed sub-\nexception has conditions that must be met in order for an actor’s practice to qualify for\nprotection under the sub-exception (84 FR 7526).\n\nModification\nWe have changed the title of this exception from “Exception—Promoting the privacy\nof electronic health information” in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7602) to “Privacy Exception —\nWhen will an actor’s practice of not fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use electronic\nhealth information in order to protect an individual’s privacy not be considered information\nblocking?” Throughout this final rule preamble, we use “Privacy Exception” as a short form\nof this title, for ease of reference. As stated in Section VIII.D of this final rule preamble, we\nhave changed the titles of all of the exceptions to questions to improve clarity. We have edited\nthe wording of the introductory text in § 171.202 as finalized, in comparison to that proposed\n(84 FR 7602) so that it is consistent with the finalized title of § 171.202. We believe these\nconforming changes in wording of the introductory text also improve clarity in this section.\n\nSpecific terminology used for the purposes of this proposed exception\nWe noted that the proposed exception used certain terms that are defined by the\nHIPAA Rules163\nbut that, for purposes of the exception, may have a broader meaning in the\ncontext of the information blocking provision and its implementing regulations as set forth in\nthe Proposed Rule. We explained that, in general, the terms “access,” “exchange,” and “use”\nhave the meaning in proposed § 171.102. However, we noted that in some instances we\n163\n45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A, C, and E of Part 164.\n\n\n\n\nreferred to “use” in the context of a disclosure or use of ePHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule,\nin which case we explicitly stated that the term “use” had the meaning defined in 45 CFR\n160.103. Similarly, we referred in a few cases to an individual’s right of access under 45 CFR\n164.524, in which case the term “access” should be understood in that HIPAA Privacy Rule\ncontext. We emphasized that, for purposes of section 3022 of the PHSA, however, the term\n“access” includes, but is broader than, an individual’s access to their PHI as provided for by\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule (84 FR 7526).\n\nFinally, we noted that the term “individual” is defined by the HIPAA Rules at 45 CFR\n160.103. Separately, under the information blocking enforcement provision, we noted that the\nterm “individual” is used to refer to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT,\nHINs, or HIEs (see section 3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA). We clarified that for purposes of this\nexception (and only this exception), we used neither of these definitions. Instead, the term\n“individual” encompassed any or all of the following: (1) an individual defined by 45 CFR\n160.103; (2) any other natural person who is the subject of EHI that is being accessed,\nexchanged or used; (3) a person who legally acts on behalf of a person described in (1) or (2),\nincluding as a personal representative, in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(g); or (4) a person\nwho is a legal representative of and can make health care decisions on behalf of any person\ndescribed in (1) or (2); or (5) an executor or administrator or other person having authority to\nact on behalf of the deceased person described in (1) or (2) or the individual’s estate under\nState or other law.\n\nWe clarified that (2) varies from (1) because there could be individuals who could be\nthe subject of EHI that is being accessed, exchanged, or used under (2), but who would not be\nthe subject of PHI under (1). For example, an actor which is not a covered entity or business\nassociate as defined under HIPAA such as a health IT developer of certified health IT may\n\n\n\n\naccess, exchange or use a patient’s electronic health information; however this “health\ninformation” would not meet the definition of PHI, but nonetheless, would be subject to this\nregulation.\n\nWe also clarified that (3) encompasses a person with legal authority to act on behalf of\nthe individual, which includes a person who is a personal representative as defined under the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule. We explained that we included the component of legal authority to act\nin (3) because the HIPAA Privacy Rule gives rights to parents or legal guardians in certain\ncircumstances where they are not the “personal representative” for their child(ren). For\ninstance, a non-custodial parent who has requested a minor child’s medical records under a\ncourt-ordered divorce decree may have legal authority to act on behalf of the child even if he\nor she is not the child’s “personal representative.” Further, we noted that in limited\ncircumstances and if permitted under State law, a family member may have legal authority to\nact on behalf of a patient to make health care decisions in emergency situations even if that\nfamily member may not be the “legal representative” or “personal representative” of the\npatient.\n\nWe noted that we adopted this specialized usage to ensure that the Privacy Exception\nextends protection to information about, and respects the privacy preferences of, all\nindividuals, not only those individuals whose EHI is protected as ePHI by HIPAA covered\nentities and business associates (84 FR 7526 and 7527).\n\nInteraction between information blocking, the exception for promoting the privacy of\nEHI, and the HIPAA Privacy Rule\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that we consulted extensively with the HHS Office for\nCivil Rights (OCR), which enforces the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification\nRules, in developing proposals to advance our shared goals of preventing information\n\n\n\n\nblocking for nefarious or self-interested purposes while maintaining and upholding existing\nprivacy rights and protections for individuals. We noted that the proposed exception for\npromoting the privacy of EHI (also referred to as the “privacy exception”) operates in a\nmanner consistent with the framework of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We explained that we\ndesigned the sub-exceptions to ensure that individual privacy rights are not diminished as a\nconsequence of the information blocking provision, and to ensure that the information\nblocking provision does not require the use or disclosure of EHI in a way that would not be\npermitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We emphasized that our intent was that the\ninformation blocking provision would not conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We noted\nthat the sub-exception proposed in § 171.202(d) reflects a policy that an actor’s denial of\naccess to an individual consistent with the limited conditions for such denials that are\ndescribed in the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) (2) and (3), is reasonable\nunder the circumstances (84 FR 7527).\n\nWe also noted that the information blocking provision may operate to require that\nactors provide access, exchange, or use of EHI in situations that the HIPAA Rules would not\nrequire access of similar information. This is because the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits, but\ndoes not require, covered entities to disclose ePHI in most circumstances. We explained that\nthe information blocking provision, on the other hand, requires that an actor provide access to,\nexchange, or use of EHI unless they are prohibited from doing so under an existing law or are\ncovered by one of the exceptions. As an illustration, we noted that the HIPAA Privacy Rule\npermits health care providers to exchange ePHI for treatment purposes but does not require\nthem to do so. Under the information blocking provision, unless an exception to information\nblocking applies, or the interference is required by law, a primary care provider would be\nrequired to exchange ePHI with a specialist who requests it to treat an individual who was a\n\n\n\n\ncommon patient of the provider and the specialist, even if the primary care provider offered\npatient care services in competition with the specialist’s practice, or would usually refer its\npatients to another specialist due to an existing business relationship (84 FR 7527).\n\nPromoting patient privacy rights\nWe stated that the information blocking provision would not require that actors\nprovide access, exchange, or use of EHI in a manner that is not permitted under the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule or other laws. As such, the privacy-protective controls existing under the HIPAA\nRules would not be weakened by the information blocking provision. Moreover, we described\nthat we structured the Privacy Exception to ensure that actors can engage in reasonable and\nnecessary practices that advance the privacy interests of individuals (84 FR 7527).\n\nWe explained that unless required by law, actors should not be compelled to share EHI\nagainst patients’ expectations under applicable law or without adequate safeguards out of a\nconcern that restricting the access, exchange, or use of the EHI would constitute information\nblocking. We acknowledged that this could seriously undermine patients’ trust and confidence\nin the privacy of their EHI and diminish the willingness of patients, providers, and other\nentities to provide or maintain health information electronically. In addition, we noted that\nsuch outcomes would undermine and not advance the goals of the information blocking\nprovision and be inconsistent with the broader policy goal of the Cures Act to facilitate trusted\nexchange of EHI. We stated that trusted exchange requires not only that EHI be shared in\naccordance with applicable law, but also that it be shared in a manner that effectuates\nindividuals’ expressed privacy preferences. We noted that an individual’s expressed privacy\npreferences will not be controlling in all cases. An actor will not be able to rely on an\nindividual’s expressed privacy preference in circumstances where the access, exchange, or use\nis required by law (84 FR 7527).\n\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, we proposed that the sub-exception in § 171.202(e) would generally\npermit an actor to give effect to individuals’ expressed privacy preferences, including their\ndesire not to permit access, exchange, or use of their EHI. At the same time, however, we\nemphasized that the Privacy Exception must be tailored to ensure that protection of an\nindividual’s privacy is not used as a pretext for information blocking. Accordingly, we\nproposed that this exception would be subject to strict conditions (84 FR 7527).\n\nPrivacy Practices Required by Law\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that because the information blocking provision\nexcludes from the definition of information blocking practices that are required by law\n(section 3022(a)(1) of the PHSA), privacy-protective practices that are required by law do not\nimplicate the information blocking provision and do not require coverage from an exception.\n\nWe noted that practices that are “required by law” can be distinguished from other practices\nthat an actor engages in pursuant to a law, but which are not “required by law.” Such laws are\ntypically framed in a way that permit an access, exchange or use of health information to be\nmade only if specific preconditions are satisfied but do not expressly require that the actor\nengage in a practice that interferes with access, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, we\nnoted that the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides that a covered entity may use or disclose PHI in\ncertain circumstances where the individual concerned has authorized the disclosure.164\nThe\neffect of this condition is that the covered entity should not use or disclose the PHI in the\nabsence of an individual’s authorization. However, we noted that because the condition does\nnot prohibit the actor from exchanging the EHI in all circumstances, the actor would be at risk\nof engaging in a practice that was information blocking unless an exception applied. For this\n164\n45 CFR 164.508 (Uses and disclosures for which an authorization is required).\n\n\n\n\nreason, we included a sub-exception, proposed in § 171.202(b), that provided that an actor will\nnot be engaging in information blocking if a State or Federal law imposes a precondition to\nthe provision of access, exchange, or use, and that precondition has not been satisfied (84 FR\n7527 and 7528).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended that we allow for EHI to be withheld if there\nare contractual privacy restrictions for the actor that may define conditions or limits on what\nthe actor may do because of those contractual restrictions. In addition, some commenters\nsuggested that contractual restrictions should be treated similarly to State and Federal privacy\nlaws under the Privacy Exception.\n\n*Response.* Please see section VIII.C.6.a (Prevention, Material Discouragement, and\nOther Interference) above regarding interference that discusses contracts including business\nassociate agreements where this is discussed in depth.\n\nDefinitions in this Exception\nAs noted above, we stated in the Proposed Rule that we consulted extensively with the\nHHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach\nNotification Rules, in developing proposals to advance our shared goals of preventing\ninformation blocking for nefarious or self-interested purposes while maintaining and\nupholding existing privacy rights and protections for individuals (84 FR 7527).\n\nThis Privacy Exception operates in a manner consistent with the framework of the\nHIPAA Rules. We have finalized the sub-exceptions to ensure that individual privacy rights\nare not diminished as a consequence of the information blocking provision, and to ensure that\nthe information blocking provision does not require the use or disclosure of EHI in a way that\nwould not be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We emphasize that our intent is that\nthe information blocking provision would not conflict with the HIPAA Rules. As such, we\n\n\n\n\nadded in the definitions section of this exception the term “HIPAA Privacy Rule” to mean 45\nCFR Parts 160 and 164 to improve readability and support the policy goal of alignment with\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nWith regards to the definition of “individual,” we have finalized this definition as\nproposed with a minor clarification, and it is not contrary to the HIPAA Rules. We note that\nthe term “individual” is defined by the HIPAA Rules at 45 CFR 160.103. Separately, under\nthe information blocking enforcement provision, we noted that the term “individual” is used to\nrefer to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT, HINs, or HIEs (see section\n3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA). We finalized that for purposes of this exception (and only this\nexception), we used neither of these definitions. Instead, the term “individual” encompassed\nany or all of the following: (1) an individual defined by 45 CFR 160.103; (2) any other natural\nperson who is the subject of EHI that is being accessed, exchanged or used; (3) a person who\nlegally acts on behalf of a person described in (1) or (2), in making decisions related to health\ncare, as a personal representative, in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(g); (4) a person who is\na legal representative of and can make health care decisions on behalf of any person described\nin paragraph (a)(1) or (2); or (5) an executor or administrator or other person having authority\nto act on behalf of a deceased person described in (1) or (2) or the individual’s estate under\nState or other law.\n\nTo clarify, we have finalized that § 171.202(a)(2)(iii) encompasses only a person who\nis a personal representative as defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We distinguish a\n“personal representative” defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule from all other natural\npersons who are legal representatives and who can make health care decisions on behalf of the\nindividual, and thus those persons are included in § 171.202(a)(2)(iv). We misstated in the\nProposed Rule that the HIPAA Privacy Rule gave rights to parents or legal guardians in\n\n\n\n\ncertain circumstances where they are not the “personal representatives.” We clarify in this\nfinal rule that, in limited circumstances and if permitted under State law, a family member\nmay be the legal representative to act on behalf of a patient to make health care decisions in\nemergency situations even if that family member may not be the “personal representative” of\nthe patient.\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments opposing this condition of the proposed\ndefinition of “individual” in the Privacy Exception.\n\n*Response.* We finalized and clarified that § 171.202(a)(2)(iii) refers to only persons\nwho meet the definition of a personal representative under 45 CFR 164.502(g), and §\n171.202(a)(2)(iv) refers to all other persons who are legal representatives of and can make\nhealth care decisions on behalf of any person that was proposed in § 171.202(a)(4).\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”\n\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that State and Federal privacy laws that permit the\ndisclosure of PHI often impose conditions that must be satisfied prior to a disclosure being\nmade. In the final rule we are deleting the word “privacy” when it refers to laws in the\nregulation text in § 171.202(b) in order to alleviate any ambiguity about what is meant as a\n“privacy law.”\n\nWe proposed to establish a sub-exception to the information blocking provision that\nrecognizes that an actor will not be engaging in information blocking if the actor does not\nprovide access, exchange, or use of EHI because a necessary precondition required by law has\nnot been satisfied. We explained that this exception would apply to all instances where an\nactor’s ability to provide access, exchange, or use is “controlled” by a legal obligation\nrequired by law that a certain condition (or multiple conditions) must be met before access,\nexchange, or use of the EHI may be provided. We emphasized that to be covered by this\n\n\n\n\nexception, the actor must comply with certain conditions, which are discussed below.\n\nWe noted that the nature of the preconditions that an actor must satisfy in order to\nprovide access, exchange, or use of EHI will depend on the laws that regulate the actor. For\nexample, an actor that is regulated by a restrictive State law may need to satisfy more\nconditions than an actor regulated by a less restrictive State law before providing access,\nexchange, or use of EHI (84 FR 7527 and 7528).\n\nWe requested comments generally on this proposed sub-exception. More specifically,\nwe sought comment on how this proposed sub-exception would be exercised by actors in the\ncontext of State laws. We noted our awareness that actors that operate across State lines or in\nmultiple jurisdictions sometimes adopt organization-wide privacy practices that conform with\nthe most restrictive laws regulating their business. We stated that we were considering the\ninclusion of an accommodation in this sub-exception that would recognize an actor’s\nobservance of a legal precondition that the actor is required by law to satisfy in at least one\nState in which it operates. We noted that, in the event that we did adopt such an\naccommodation, we would also need to carefully consider how to ensure that before the use of\nthe most stringent restriction is applied in all jurisdictions, the actor has provided all privacy\nprotections afforded by that law across its entire business. This type of approach would ensure\nthat an actor cannot take advantage of a more-restrictive law for the benefit of this exception\nwhile not also fulfilling the privacy-protective obligations of the law being relied on. We\nrequested comment on whether there is a need for ONC to adopt such an accommodation for\nactors operating in multiple states and encouraged commenters to identify any additional\nconditions that should attach to the provision of such an accommodation. We also requested\ncomment on our proposed approach to addressing variation in State laws throughout this\nproposed sub-exception (84 FR 7528).\n\n\n\n\nWe also recognized that some states have enacted laws that more comprehensively\nidentify the circumstance in which an individual or actor can and cannot provide access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. We stated that we were considering to what extent health care\nproviders that are not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and would rely instead on State\nlaws for this sub-exception, would be able to benefit from this sub-exception when engaging\nin practices that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for the purpose of promoting\npatient privacy. We sought comment on any challenges that may be encountered by health\ncare providers that are not regulated as covered entities under the HIPAA Privacy Rule when\nseeking to take advantage of this proposed sub-exception. We also sought comment on\nwhether there exists a class of health care provider that is not regulated by any Federal or State\nlaw that prescribes preconditions that must be satisfied in connection with the disclosure of\nEHI, and whether any such class of health care provider would benefit from a sub-exception\nsimilar to that proposed in § 171.202(c) for health IT developers of certified health IT (84 FR\n7529).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that actors who operate across multiple\nstates with different preconditions for disclosure under local laws should be able to adopt\nuniform requirements across their organizations that satisfy the most stringent preconditions\nof those local laws for purposes of this sub-exception. They stated that this is appropriate\nbecause it is often difficult for organizations operating across State lines to develop different\nworkflows for each State. However, other commenters requested that actors should be\npermitted to select which portions of a State law should be included in procedures\nimplemented across all states rather than being required to provide all privacy protections\nafforded by that law across its entire business. Other commenters believed that it should be\nleft to the actor’s discretion to determine whether it is better to have a uniform approach\n\n\n\n\nacross all the jurisdictions it operates in or whether a State-by-State approach is more\nappropriate. They mentioned that such flexibility also would align with the Department’s\noverall goal of reducing administrative burden particularly on providers while ensuring a high\ndegree of privacy protection for patients.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the various comments and recognize that it is difficult for\norganizations operating across State lines to have different workflows for each State while\nassuring privacy, particularly the individual’s right under the HIPAA Rules to obtain their\nPHI. Additionally, it is important that any uniform policies and procedures must in fact be\nimplemented across an actor’s entire organization and not be applied selectively in ways\nwhich might be contrary to the information blocking provision.\n\nBalancing these goals, this final rule provides that, except for an individual’s access to\ntheir EHI as discussed below, actors may meet this sub-exception if they operate across\nmultiple states and elect to adopt and implement uniform policies and procedures required by\none State that are more restrictive (i.e., provide greater privacy protections) than would\notherwise be required by another specific State or Federal law. To be considered more\nrestrictive in this context, a law might require more or different preconditions to the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI than Federal law or the law of another State in which the actor\noperates. Alternatively, an actor could comply with the preconditions of each State in which it\noperates on a State-by-State basis with respect to the EHI requested. These alternatives\nprovide multi-state actors with significant flexibility without adversely impacting an\nindividual’s right to obtain EHI as described below.\n\nAn actor that operates in multiple states could either comply with the laws of each\nState in which it operates or comply with the most restrictive State laws in which it operates\nand where applicable, comply with Federal law requirements. The actor will need to document\n\n\n\n\neither approach in its policies and procedures in which the actor has adopted and implemented\nin order to meet the conditions of § 171.202(b)(1)(i) because the uniform approach will not be\navailable to actors that operate on a case by case basis without policies and procedures as\ncontemplated by subsection § 171.202(b)(1)(ii). Those actors without uniform policies and\nprocedures will need to comply with each of the applicable State and Federal laws.\n\nAs noted above, the uniform policy and procedure approach to individual access\nrequests for EHI must assure alignment with the HIPAA Privacy Rule and individual access\nimplementation specifications to help assure that the broader policy goals for individual access\nto EHI are met. Specifically, when an actor receives a request by or on behalf of an individual\nunder 45 CFR 164.524 for the individual’s EHI, the actor must not impose preconditions in its\npolicies and procedures which would affect the individual’s right to access under the HIPAA\nRules even when it is operating in multiple states.\n\nWe note that an actor may not inappropriately seek to use State or Federal laws as a\nshield against disclosing EHI. For example, we would expect that actors implement State-\nmandated preconditions consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner when fulfilling\nrequests to access, exchange, or use EHI. Additionally, we caution actors who repeatedly\nchange their privacy policies depending on the EHI requestor or the request that such actions\nmay be considered intended to materially interfere with, prevent, or discourage the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI.\n\nWe note that we have modified the introductory text in § 171.202(b) for clarity and\nprecision. The final introductory text reads as follows: “To qualify for the exception on the\nbasis that one or more Federal or State preconditions for providing access, exchange, or use of\nelectronic health information have not been satisfied, the following requirements must be\nmet…” The changes to the final introductory text from the proposed introductory text (see 84\n\n\n\n\nFR 7602) are not substantive and do not change the meaning of the introductory text.\n\nWe also note that we have added “and actions” in § 171.202(b)(3)—“For purposes of\ndetermining whether the actor’s privacy policies and procedures and actions satisfy the\nrequirements of subsections (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2) above when the actor’s operations are subject\nto multiple laws which have inconsistent preconditions, they shall be deemed to satisfy the\nrequirements of the subsections if the actor has adopted uniform privacy policies and\nprocedures to address the more restrictive preconditions.” We added this language for\naccuracy and clarity.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested that we provide clarification on all the Federal and\nState privacy laws considered when developing the “applicable State and Federal privacy\nlaws” threshold condition of this sub-exception. They requested that the final rule make clear\nthat those State privacy laws that are more restrictive than Federal privacy laws (e.g., 42 CFR\npart 2 and HIPAA) take precedence over the less stringent Federal privacy laws.\n\n*Response.* As mentioned above, for clarity purposes, we have not included the word\n“privacy” in the final regulation text in § 171.202(b) in order to alleviate any ambiguity\nregarding what is meant as a “privacy law.” The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides a Federal floor\nof privacy protections for an individual’s individually identifiable health information where\nthat information is held by a covered entity or by a business associate of the covered entity.\n\nThis sub-exception does not alter an actor’s ability to comply with applicable Federal or State\nlaws.\n\nTo illustrate this sub-exception, we provided the following examples. We note that this\nlist of examples is not exhaustive and that preconditions required by law that control access,\nexchange, or use of EHI that are not listed below would still qualify under this proposed sub-\nexception so long as all conditions are met.\n\n\n\n\n Although the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not have individual “consent” requirements for\nuses and disclosures of PHI for purposes such as treatment, payment, and health care\noperations, certain Federal and State laws do require that a person provide consent before\ntheir EHI can be accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes. For example, some\nState laws require an individual’s consent for uses and disclosures of EHI regarding some\nsensitive health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental health, or genetic testing.\n\nAdditionally, actors that are under “Part 2 programs,” which means federally assisted\nprograms (“federally assisted” as defined in 42 CFR 2.12(b) and “program” as defined in\n42 CFR 2.11), generally are required to obtain an individual’s consent to disclose or re-\ndisclose patient-identifying information related to the individual’s substance use disorder,\nsuch as treatment for addiction. The sub-exception would operate to clarify an actor’s\ncompliance obligations in these situations. In such scenarios, it would not be considered\ninformation blocking to refuse to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI if the actor has\nnot received the individual’s consent, subject to requirements discussed herein.\n\n If an actor is required by law to obtain an individual’s HIPAA authorization before\nproviding access, exchange, or use of the individual’s EHI, then the individual’s refusal to\nprovide an authorization would justify the actor’s refusal to provide access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI. The actor’s refusal would, subject to conditions discussed herein, be protected\nunder this sub-exception.\n\n The HIPAA Privacy Rule, and many State laws, permit the disclosure of PHI in certain\ncircumstances only once the identity and authority of the person requesting the\ninformation has been verified. We acknowledge that it is reasonable and necessary that\nactors take appropriate steps, consistent with Federal and State laws, to ensure that EHI is\nnot disclosed to the wrong person or to a person who is not authorized to receive it. Where\n\n\n\n\nan actor cannot verify the identity or authority of a person requesting access to EHI, and\nsuch verification is required by law before the actor can provide access, exchange, or use\nof the EHI, the actor’s refusal to provide access, exchange, or use of the EHI will, subject\nto the conditions discussed herein, will not be information blocking.\n\n Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a health care provider may share information with\nanother health care provider for a quality improvement project if it has verified that the\nrequesting entity has a relationship with the person whose information is being requested.\n\nWhere the actor could not establish if the relationship existed, it would not be information\nblocking for the actor to refuse to provide access, exchange, or use, subject to the\nconditions discussed herein.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments on the Privacy Exception expressing concern about\nwhether a business associate (as defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule) would be liable for\ninformation blocking practices for not providing access, exchange, or use of EHI because\ndoing so would violate its business associate agreement.\n\n*Response.* Please see section VIII.C.6.a. (Prevention, Material Discouragement and\nOther Interference) above regarding interference that discusses contracts including business\nassociate agreements where this is discussed in depth.\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”: Conditions to be met to qualify for this\nsub-exception\nWe noted that in most circumstances, an actor would be in a position to influence\nwhether a precondition is satisfied. For example, an actor could deprive a person of the\nopportunity to take some step that is a prerequisite for the exchange of their EHI, could\nassume the existence of a fact prejudicial to the granting of access without seeking to discover\nthe actual facts, or could make a determination that a precondition was not satisfied without\n\n\n\n\nproperly considering or seeking all relevant information. As such, we proposed that this\nexception would be subject to conditions that ensure that the protection of an individual’s\nprivacy is not used as a pretext for information blocking (84 FR 7529).\n\nWe proposed that an actor can qualify, in part, for this sub-exception by implementing\nand conforming to organizational policies and procedures that identify the criteria to be used\nby the actor and, as applicable, the steps that the actor will take, in order to satisfy the\nprecondition.\n\nWe noted that most actors are covered entities or business associates for the purposes\nof the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and are already required to have policies, procedures, and\ntraining programs in place that address how ePHI (as defined in 45 CFR 160.103) is used and\ndisclosed. As such, we expected that the overwhelming majority of actors will already be in a\nposition to meet this condition or would be able to meet this condition with modest additional\neffort. However, we acknowledged that some actors may not, for whatever reason, have\nprivacy policies and practices in place, or may have implemented privacy policies and\npractices that do not sufficiently address the criteria to be used, and steps to be taken, to satisfy\na precondition relied on by the actor. As such, we proposed to provide an alternative basis on\nwhich to qualify, in part, for this sub-exception. We proposed to permit actors to instead\ndocument, on a case-by-case basis, the criteria used by the actor to determine when the\nprecondition will be satisfied, any criteria that were not met, and the reason why the criteria\nwere not met (84 FR 7529).\n\nSeparately, we proposed that if the precondition that an actor purportedly needs to\nsatisfy relies on the provision of a consent or authorization from an individual, it is a\nrequirement for the condition(s) of this sub-exception that the actor (i) did all things\nreasonably necessary within its control to provide the individual with a meaningful\n\n\n\n\nopportunity to provide the consent or authorization and (ii) did not improperly encourage or\ninduce the individual to not provide the consent or authorization (84 FR 7529).\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”: Practice must be implemented in a\nconsistent and non-discriminatory manner\nWe proposed that in order for a practice to qualify for this sub-exception, the practice\nmust be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner (proposed §\n171.202(b)(3)(ii)). This condition would provide basic assurance that the purported privacy\npractice is directly related to a specific privacy risk and is not being used to interfere with\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this exception does not apply.\n\nWe proposed that this condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practices\nmust be based on objective criteria that apply uniformly for all substantially similar privacy\nrisks. We explained that an actor could not, for example, implement an organizational privacy\npolicy that imposed unreasonably onerous requirements on a certain class of individuals or\nentities without a legitimate justification for doing so. We explained that this condition\nprovides basic assurance that the purported privacy-protective practice is not being used to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this proposed\nexception does not apply (84 FR 7532).\n\nWe requested comment on this proposed condition.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters agreed that having an organizational policy which outlines\npatient preference categories and restrictions should be created and utilized in a consistent and\nnon-discriminatory manner for all patient requests.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenters, and for clarity, we moved this proposed\nsection to finalize in § 171.202(b)(1), in order to address when an actor has conformed to its\norganizational policies and procedures and when an actor documents on a case-by-case basis\n\n\n\n\nwhen a precondition has been satisfied. In both cases, the actor’s practice must be\nimplemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. We provide the following\nexample to illustrate the requirement that a practice must be implemented in a consistent and\nnon-discriminatory manner.\n\nFor example, we noted an actor that offered a patient-facing software application (app)\nwould not be able to benefit from this exception if it refused to exchange EHI with a\ncompetitor app because the individual failed to meet onerous authorization requirements that\napplied only to the exchange of EHI with the competitor app and did not apply to others that\npresented no greater privacy or security risk.\n\nIn context of this condition of the Privacy Exception, and consistent with its\ninterpretation for information blocking exceptions defined in part 171 subpart B in general,\n“consistent and non-discriminatory” should be understood to mean that similarly situated\nactors whose interactions pose the same level of privacy risk should be treated consistently\nwith one another under the actor’s privacy practices. Inconsistent treatment across similarly\nsituated actors whose interactions pose the same level of privacy risk based on extraneous\nfactors, such as whether they are a competitor of the actor implementing the privacy practices,\nwould not be considered appropriate.\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”: Practice must be tailored to the\napplicable precondition\nWe proposed that for actors who seek to qualify for this sub-exception, an actor’s\nprivacy-protective practice (proposed (§ 171.202(b)(3)(i)) must be tailored to the specific\nprivacy risks that the practice actually addresses. This condition necessarily presupposes that\nan actor has carefully evaluated the privacy requirements imposed on the actor, the privacy\ninterests to be managed by the actor, and has developed a considered response that is tailored\n\n\n\n\nto protecting and promoting the privacy of EHI. For example, we noted that the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.514(h) requires that, in certain circumstances, the disclosure of\nPHI is only authorized once the identity and authority of the person requesting the information\nhas been verified. The privacy issue to be addressed in this instance is the risk that PHI will be\ndisclosed to the wrong individual or an unauthorized person. We proposed that if an actor\nchooses not to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI on the basis that the actor’s identity\nverification requirements have not been satisfied, the actor’s practice must be tailored to the\nspecific privacy risks at issue. We noted that this would require that the actor ensure that it\ndoes not impose identity verification requirements that are unreasonably onerous under the\ncircumstances (84 FR 7531).\n\nFor the purposes of this sub-exception, we proposed that engaging in an interference\non the basis that a precondition has not been satisfied would be a practice that addresses a\nprivacy risk or interest, and so tailoring that interference to satisfy a precondition could satisfy\nthis requirement if all of the elements are met.\n\nWe requested comment on this proposed condition.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed a belief that a requirement that a “practice must be\ntailored to the specific privacy risk or interest being addressed” could lead to unnecessary\ncomplexity, and that such a policy could be overly prescriptive. In addition, commenters\nexpressed that we should provide more use cases to help providers and others better\nunderstand how this element of the sub-exception could be met.\n\n*Response.* We agree. We believe that a precondition should be tailored to the\napplicable legal requirement and not be tied only to a privacy risk or interest. To require that\nan actor’s practice be tailored to the specific privacy risk or interest without a legally imposed\nrequirement could lead to overly strict as well as an ambiguous requirement. As such, we\n\n\n\n\nbelieve that it is an important policy interest that an actor carefully evaluate the State or\nFederal law requirements imposed upon an actor, and that the actor develop a response that is\ntailored to the legal precondition which protect and promote the privacy of EHI. We provide\nthe following use case to provide a greater understanding of how this element of the sub-\nexception can be met.\n\n To meet a legal precondition whereby an actor must identify a patient before accessing,\nexchanging or using EHI, an actor’s policy that a driver’s license was the only accepted\ngovernment-issued form of identification (as opposed to other types of legally acceptable\nforms of identification such as a valid passport) would not be a practice that is tailored to\nthe applicable precondition legal requirement because the provider’s preference for one\nform of government-issued identification over another does not meaningfully address this\nlegal precondition.\n\nWe have finalized that to qualify for this sub-exception on the basis that State or\nFederal law requires one or more preconditions to be met before providing access, exchange,\nor use of EHI the precondition should be based upon the applicable legal requirements.\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”: Organizational policies and\nprocedures or case-by-case basis\nWe proposed that if an actor seeks to qualify for this sub-exception, in part, by\nimplementing and conforming to organizational policies and procedures, such policies and\nprocedures must be in writing, and specify the criteria to be used by the actor, and, if\napplicable, the steps that the actor will take, in order to satisfy the precondition relied on by\nthe actor not to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI. We emphasized that it would not be\nsufficient for an actor to simply identify the existence of the precondition in their\norganizational policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed that an actor would only be eligible to benefit from this sub-exception if\nit has implemented and followed its processes and policies. This would include taking\nreasonable steps to ensure that its workforce members and agents understand and consistently\napply the policies and procedures (84 FR 7529 and 7530).\n\nWe requested comment on the proposed condition generally, and specifically, on\nwhether an actor’s organizational policies and procedures provide a sufficiently robust and\nreliable basis for evaluating the bona fides, reasonableness, and necessity of practices engaged\nin to satisfy preconditions required by State or Federal privacy laws (84 FR 7529 and 7530).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters recommended that actors should be able to have written\norganization-specific policies that may be more restrictive than State or Federal law and that\nhealth information networks and exchanges should be given an exemption based on their\nexisting written governance policies. Other commenters recommended adding language\nindicating that organizational policies must comply with Federal, State, and local laws or that\nthe final rule should specify that organizations should implement policies which conform to\nthe specific State laws in which the information originates.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, this final rule includes a limited exception that permits an\nactor that operates in more than one State to adopt uniform policies and procedures based on\nmore restrictive provisions of State and Federal law, subject to certain conditions. ONC\nreiterates that an actor’s organizational policies and procedures should not be used as a pretext\nfor information blocking. For example, information blocking may exist if an actor’s policies\nand procedures impose onerous additional privacy requirements for access, exchange or use of\nEHI beyond what is required by law, or where an actor repeatedly changes its privacy policies\nand procedures to circumvent this exception. Further, the actor’s policies and procedures must\nbe tailored and must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner.\n\n\n\n\nWe do not agree that health information exchanges or networks should be given a\nblanket exemption based on their existing written governance policies because that could lead\nto a situation involving information blocking if those policies imposed conditions that conflict\nwith the information blocking provision. Secondly, we expect that an actor’s organizational\npolicies will conform with applicable laws, including the information blocking provision, so it\nis not necessary to further require actors to implement policies which conform to the specific\nlaws, including the law of the State in which the information originated.\n\nDocumenting criteria and rationale\nIf an actor’s practice does not conform to an actor’s organizational policies and\nprocedures as required by § 171.202(b)(1)(i), we proposed that an actor can seek to qualify for\nthis sub-exception, in part, by documenting how it reached its decision that it would not\nprovide access, use, or exchange of EHI on the basis that a precondition had not been\nsatisfied. We proposed that such documentation must be created on a case-by-case basis\nproposed in § 171.202(b)(1)(ii). We noted that an actor will not satisfy this condition if, for\ninstance, it sought to document a general practice that it had applied to all instances where the\nprecondition had not been satisfied. Rather, we stated that the record created by the actor must\naddress the specific circumstances of the specific practice (or interference) at issue.\n\nWe proposed that the record created by the actor must identify the objective criteria\nused by the actor to determine when the precondition is satisfied. Consistent with the\ncondition to this sub-exception that the practice must be tailored to the privacy interest at\nissue, those criteria would need to be directly relevant to satisfying the requirement. For\nexample, we explained that if the requirement at issue was the provision of a valid HIPAA\nauthorization, the actor’s documented record should reflect, at minimum, that the\nauthorization would need to meet each of the requirements specified for a valid authorization\n\n\n\n\nat 45 CFR 164.508(c). The record would then need to document the criteria that had not been\nmet, and the reason why it was not met. We noted that the actor could record that the\nauthorization did not contain the name or other specific identification of the person making the\nrequest because the authorization only disclosed the person’s first initial rather than a first\nname, and the actor had records about multiple people with that same initial and last name.\n\nWe noted that this condition would provide the transparency necessary to demonstrate\nwhether the actor has satisfied the conditions applicable to this exception. Moreover, we noted\nthat it will help ensure that a decision to not provide access, exchange, or use of EHI is\nconsidered and deliberate, and therefore reasonable and necessary (84 FR 7530).\n\nWe requested comment on this proposed condition.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested that we should provide specificity on what type of\ndocumentation would suffice to demonstrate that an actor met this sub-exception. Commenters\nwere concerned that these were stringent documentation requirements and that provider\npractices may inadvertently trigger a violation of information blocking. Other commenters\nsuggested that we should remove or consider reducing onerous requirements for\ndocumentation for qualifying for the privacy sub-exceptions, and other commenters requested\nspecification on what form the documentation must be and to specify whether existing\ndocumentation required by the HIPAA Rules (e.g., patient informed consent and authorization\nforms, Notice of Privacy Practices, Security Risk Analysis, etc.) would satisfy the\ndocumentation requirements under this Privacy Exception.\n\n*Response.* The documentation requirements are for the actor to comply with applicable\nState and Federal laws and to assure that after the fact rationalizations are not used to justify\npractices that have already occurred, consistent with the policy objectives of the information\nblocking provision.\n\n\n\n\nTo finalize the documentation requirements we looked to OIG, which has authority\nunder section 3022(b) of the PHSA to investigate any claim that an actor engaged in\ninformation blocking. OIG regulations in other contexts include a writing requirement. For\nexample, OIG has promulgated the “safe harbors” provisions at 42 CFR 1001.952, specifying\nvarious payment and business practices that would not be subject to sanctions under the Anti-\nKickback Statute. Several of these safe harbors include a writing requirement to document in\nwriting an agreement, lease, or other transaction. These documentation requirements do not\noften get into specific terms or requirements, but rather tend to be more general in nature.\n\nHowever, the documentation requirements do provide indicia of evidence that an entity has\nmet the requirements of the safe harbor provisions.\n\nIn addition, we considered the documentation requirements in the HIPAA Rules. The\nHIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 C.F.R 164.530 (j) requires a covered entity to maintain its policies\nand procedures in written or electronic form for six years from the date of its creation or the\ndate when it last was in effect, whichever is later. In our review of the OIG and HIPAA\nregulations, we believe that the documentation requirement for this sub-exception is consistent\nwith the safe harbor and HIPAA Privacy Rule documentation requirements. Further, we do\nnot believe this documentation requirement would be onerous.\n\nTherefore, we have finalized the following requirements for this sub-exception. An\nactor must document its organizational policies and procedures and specify the criteria used\nby the actor and as applicable, the steps that the actor will take to satisfy the precondition.\n\nSuch steps may include providing the actor’s workforce members with training on those\npolicies and procedures. Alternatively, we have finalized a requirement an actor must\ndocument on a case-by-case basis how it reached its decision that it would not provide access,\nuse, or exchange of EHI on the basis that a precondition had not been satisfied, including the\n\n\n\n\ncriteria it used to determine when the precondition is satisfied. That is, an actor can provide\ndocumentation that identifies the objective criteria that the actor applied in order to determine\nwhether the precondition had been satisfied. Additionally, the actor must provide\ndocumentation that the practice is tailored to those criteria that are directly relevant to\nsatisfying the precondition.\n\nSub-exception 1: “Precondition not satisfied”: Precondition relies on a consent or\nauthorization\nWe proposed that if the precondition that an actor purports to rely upon requires the\nprovision of a consent or authorization from an individual, it is a condition of this sub-\nexception that the actor must have done all things reasonably necessary within its control to\nprovide the individual with a meaningful opportunity to provide that consent or authorization.\n\nWe noted that this requirement will be relevant when, for example, a State privacy law or the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule requires an individual to provide consent and/or a HIPAA authorization\nbefore identifiable information can be accessed, exchanged, or used for specific purposes.\n\nWe stated that we were considering addressing this condition in further detail, whether\nby way of additional guidance or in regulation text. To this end, we requested comments\nregarding what actions an actor should take, within the actor’s control, to provide an\nindividual with a meaningful opportunity to provide a required consent or HIPAA\nauthorization, and whether different expectations should arise in the context of a consent\nversus a HIPAA authorization. Separately, we proposed that to qualify for this sub-exception,\nto the extent that the precondition at issue was the provision of a consent or HIPAA\nauthorization by an individual, the actor must not have improperly encouraged or induced the\nindividual to not provide the consent or HIPAA authorization. We clarified that this does not\nmean that the actor cannot inform an individual about the advantages and disadvantages of\n\n\n\n\nexchanging EHI and any associated risks, so long as the information communicated is\naccurate and legitimate. However, we noted that an actor would not meet this condition in the\nevent that it misled an individual about the nature of the consent to be provided, dissuaded\nindividuals from providing consent in respect of disclosures to the actor’s competitors, or\nimposed onerous requirements to effectuate consent that were unnecessary and not required by\nlaw.\n\nWe requested comment on whether the proposed condition requiring the provision of a\nmeaningful opportunity and prohibiting improper encouragement or inducement should apply\nto preconditions beyond the precondition that an individual provide consent or authorization.\n\nWe requested comment on whether the conditions specified for this sub-exception, when\ntaken in total, are sufficiently particularized and sufficiently strict to ensure that actors that are\nin a position to influence whether a precondition is satisfied will not be able to take advantage\nof this sub-exception and seek protection for practices that do not promote the privacy of EHI.\n\nWe also requested comment on whether we should adopt a more tailored approach to\nconditioning the availability of this exception. For example, we noted that we were\nconsidering whether different conditions should apply depending on: (i) the nature of the EHI\nat issue; (ii) the circumstances in which the EHI is being access, exchanged, or used; (iii) the\ninterest being protected by the precondition; or (iv) the nature of the precondition to be\nsatisfied. We encouraged commenters to identify scenarios in which the application of the\nconditions applicable to this sub-exception, as proposed, give rise to unnecessary burden, or\nwould require activities that do not advance the dual policy interests of preventing information\nblocking and promoting privacy and security (84 FR 7530 and 7531).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters noted that the entire condition was too vague and\ngenerally inconsistent with current standard industry relationships and practices. Several\n\n\n\n\ncommenters suggested that the burden to obtain the consent should be on the organization\nrequesting the data rather than on the organization that holds the data. However, commenters\nwho suggested this often acknowledged that modifying our proposal to fit their suggestion\nwould require an actor to receive assurances that consents are legitimate and in their\npossession before sharing any data. These commenters often noted that it was not clear how\nrecipients of health care data subject to authorizations and consent would be expected to\nprovide individuals with a meaningful opportunity to consent if they do not have an existing\nrelationship with that individual or means to contact that individual. A few commenters\nrecommended modifying this condition so that an actor that does not have a direct relationship\nwith patients is not required to obtain patient consent or authorization.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenters and have attempted to address concerns\nabout vagueness and consistency with industry practices and relationships. This finalized sub-\nexception requires the actor to have used reasonable efforts within its control if the actor has\nalready received a form of required consent or authorization that does not meet all applicable\nrequirements. Specifically, the actor must have used reasonable efforts within its control to\nprovide the individual with a consent or authorization form that satisfies all applicable\nrequirements or have provided other reasonable assistance with respect to the deficiencies. In\neffect, this places more of an obligation on the party requesting the EHI and the individual to\nattempt to satisfy the precondition by providing a consent or authorization. This final rule does\nnot require the actor that receives the request to obtain a patient’s consent or authorization to\ndo all things reasonably necessary within its control to provide the individual with a\nmeaningful opportunity to provide the consent or authorization. Rather, the final rule requires\nthat the actor is obligated to take reasonable steps to provide a sufficient consent or\nauthorization form or other reasonable assistance.\n\n\n\n\nProviding other reasonable assistance does not mean that the actor needs to “chase” the\nindividual to obtain a sufficient consent or authorization. Such other reasonable assistance\nmight include notifying the individual of elements that are missing in the consent or\nauthorization initially provided, such as a witness or an expiration date if legally required.\n\nWe believe that setting the standard for an actor’s actions with respect to an\ninsufficient consent or authorization at reasonable efforts is an appropriate standard to use\nbecause it aligns with the case-by-case approach that is captured in the information blocking\nprovision that is the subject of this final rule.\n\nWe recognize that actors must accommodate variations in laws across the states in\nwhich they operate. As discussed above, this final rule provides flexibility to multi-state\nproviders with respect to how they may structure uniform policies and procedures regarding\nconsents and authorizations provided that they do in fact apply them. We also recognize that\nsome types of actors will not have the necessary legal rights or the technical access to detailed\npatient information to determine if a consent or authorization is required as a precondition.\n\nWe intend that each actor must do what is reasonable and what is within its control.\n\nThis applies to actors who are providers that have a direct patient relationship and to actors\nthat are supporting a health care provider with respect to an insufficient consent or\nauthorization that must also use reasonable efforts to avoid possible information blocking.\n\nA health information network that receives an insufficient consent or authorization\nmight find that this sub-exception helpful if it does not have lawful access to the individual’s\ninformation to determine what consent might be required under State or Federal\nconfidentiality laws that apply to information about mental health, substance abuse, HIV\nstatus or other highly confidential diseases or conditions. We also note that if a network is not\nable to review such information under applicable law, providing a corrected consent would not\n\n\n\n\nbe within its control.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters were concerned that our definition of “meaningful\nopportunity” was too broad. These few commenters suggested that, as proposed, our definition\nof “meaningful opportunity” could place a significant burden on providers. Specifically, these\ncommenters suggested that adding a “meaningful” opportunity to consent to the patient, with\nits requisite new forms and procedures, would add new burdens on actors without appearing to\nsolve any existing problems.\n\nOne commenter recommended that we modify this requirement to include a reasonable\nopportunity for the provider to obtain the individual’s consent the next time the patient visits\nthe office if the patient is not present in the office to provide consent.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments that we have received on the meaningful\nopportunity provision. After considering the comments, we eliminated the “meaningful\nopportunity” provision in this final rule. However, this sub-exception still requires the actor to\nuse reasonable efforts within its control and to provide reasonable assistance, which might\ninclude explaining the required elements of a consent or authorization, or providing a witness\nif required by law and requested by the patient at an office visit with the actor.\n\nHowever, the requirement of reasonable efforts is based on an assumption that actors\nmay not use the protection of an individual’s privacy as pretext for information blocking. If a\nrequestor provides or obtains some form of patient documented consent or authorization that\nrequires the actor’s assistance to satisfy elements that are not required by law and the actor\ndoes not provide such assistance, the actor may be engaged in information blocking.\n\nWe recognize that meeting certain preconditions may be outside the direct control of\nthe provider. For example, the actor may have a pre-existing consent form from the individual\nthat needs to be modified due to a change in applicable law. The actor may have a very\n\n\n\n\ndifficult time tracking down a former patient to provide the updated consent form. In most\ncases, it would be reasonable to mail or email the updated form to the patient’s last address on\nthe actor’s records or present it to the patient at visit scheduled in the near future. If the patient\ncancels the visit, it may be reasonable for the actor to wait to obtain the consent until the next\ntime the patient visits the physical location of the actor’s office, so long as the actor explains\nthe insufficiency and provides a sufficient consent form at the next visit.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters have mentioned that a health information network (HIN) does\nnot have operational control over or visibility into the detailed decision-making of an\nindividual’s consent or authorization of its participants, and they argue that an actor such as a\nHIN should not be obligated to review or confirm the individuals’ consent or authorization,\nand that such confirmation is a requirement of the health care provider because health care\nprovider has a direct relationship with the patient.\n\n*Response.* We believe that actors such as a HIN do have the obligation to comply with\nthe conditions of this sub-exception. We have taken the approach that each actor must use its\n“reasonable efforts” and focus on what reasonable steps they can take to provide their\nreasonable efforts. We do not, however, believe that actors who have a direct patient\nrelationship would have a higher standard of reasonable efforts than those actors such as HINs\nwhich do not have a direct relationship with a patient and are acting on behalf of a health care\nprovider. However, even actors that do not have a direct relationship with an individual,\nshould use their reasonable efforts for the activities under their control as it relates to\nsupporting the providing or obtaining of a consent or authorization.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concerns that actors would be required to create\nnew policies beyond HIPAA aimed at offering patients a “meaningful” opportunity to consent,\nand as a result, more challenges than solutions would result from this policy. Commenters\n\n\n\n\nnoted unnecessary administrative burdens, confusion with HIPAA requirements, and\ncomplexity for actors as some of the possible challenges.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, the “meaningful opportunity” requirement was not\nincluded in this final rule.\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters expressed the opinion that actors meeting certain\npreconditions may be outside the direct control of the actor and recommended that examples\nshould be provided about what actions are sufficient to meet the \"reasonably necessary\"\nstandard. Another commenter argued that the reasonably necessary standard for the\nmeaningful opportunity requirement only stands to further aggravate the burdensome nature of\nmore stringent privacy laws. Other commenters were concerned that the requirement that the\nactor “did all things reasonably necessary within its control to provide the individual with a\nmeaningful opportunity to provide the consent or authorization” was too rigid a requirement\nand that even if one possible action was not done, the exception would not apply. Other\ncommenters argued that this standard was an extremely onerous requirement and contradicts\nthe stated intent of reducing the overall administrative burden on health care practices.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, the standard is now based on reasonable efforts within the\nactor’s control, and it applies only after the actor receives a consent or authorization form that\ndoes not satisfy all applicable conditions. We believe that this change addresses the comments\nnoted above. We note that we have slightly modified the terminology used in §\n171.202(b)(2)(i). We proposed “a form of consent or authorization” (84 FR 7602) and have\nchange that language in the final rule to “a consent or authorization form” for clarity. This\nmodification does not change the meaning of § 171.202(b)(2)(i).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter expressed concern to modify this exception to make it clear\nthat a hospital or health system may claim the exception when an entity requesting patient data\n\n\n\n\ndoes not communicate that it has obtained consent.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, this condition of the sub-exception applies only after an\ninsufficient consent or authorization is received. This condition of the sub-exception in the\nfinal rule does not apply when the actor has not received anything regarding the individual’s\nconsent or authorization. In such cases, the actor would not be required to communicate to the\nentity requesting the EHI that the actor has not obtained the individual’s consent or\nauthorization in order to meet this sub-exception.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter argued that actors should provide the individual with a\n“reasonably convenient opportunity” to provide the consent or authorization, rather than\nrequiring “all things reasonably necessary within its control” to provide consent or\nauthorization. The commenter noted that where entities make the request on behalf of the\nindividual, the actor making the request should facilitate the gathering of the consent or\nauthorization.\n\n*Response.* As noted above, both the “reasonable opportunity” and the “all things\nreasonably necessary” language are not included in this final rule, but the actor must satisfy\nthe reasonable efforts standard when an insufficient consent or authorization has been\nreceived. This might include providing a correct form or reasonable assistance to the\nindividual to solve any consent or authorization documentation problems necessary to address\nthe insufficiency.\n\nSub-exception 1: Precondition not satisfied: Did not improperly encourage or induce\nthe individual to withhold the consent or authorization\nWe proposed that to qualify for this sub-exception, to the extent that the precondition\nat issue was the provision of a consent or authorization by an individual, the actor must not\nhave improperly encouraged or induced the individual to not provide the consent or\n\n\n\n\nauthorization. As proposed, an actor would not meet this condition in the event that it misled\nan individual about the nature of the consent to be provided, dissuaded individuals from\nproviding consent in respect of disclosures to the actor’s competitors, or imposed onerous\nrequirements to effectuate consent that were unnecessary and not required by law.\n\nWe sought comment on whether the proposed condition requiring the provision of\nprohibiting improper encouragement or inducement should apply to preconditions beyond the\nprecondition that an individual provide consent or authorization. We sought comment on\nwhether the conditions specified for this sub-exception, when taken in total, are sufficiently\nparticularized and sufficiently strict to ensure that actors that are in a position to influence\nwhether a precondition is satisfied will not be able to take advantage of this sub-exception and\nseek protection for practices that do not promote the privacy of EHI. We also sought comment\non whether we should adopt a more tailored approach to conditioning the availability of this\nsub-exception (84 FR 7531).\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments opposing this condition applicable to practices\nthat implement the provision of a consent or authorization from an individual to an actor.\n\n*Response.* Within the sub-exception (§ 171.202(b)) applicable to practices that\nimplement a consent or authorization, we are finalizing in § 171.202(b)(2)(ii) as proposed.\n\nSub-exception 2: Sub-exception: Health IT developer of certified health IT not covered\nby HIPAA\nThe sub-exception we proposed in § 171.202(b) recognized as reasonable and\nnecessary the activities engaged in by actors consistent with the controls placed on access,\nexchange, or use of EHI by Federal and State laws. We noted that the sub-exception was\nlimited to actors that are subject to those Federal and State laws; an actor that is not regulated\nby HIPAA cannot benefit from the exception proposed in § 171.202(b).\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed to establish a sub-exception to the information blocking provision that\nwould apply to actors that are health IT developers of certified health IT but not regulated by\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule in respect to the operation of the actor’s health IT product or service\n(referred to as “non-covered actors” for this sub-exception). We noted that we expect that the\nclass of actors to which this proposed sub-exception applies will be very small. We explained\nthat the vast majority of health IT developers of certified health IT operate as business\nassociates to covered entities under HIPAA. As business associates, they are regulated by the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule, and may be able to benefit from the exception proposed in § 171.202(b)\nto the extent that the HIPAA Privacy Rule (or applicable State law) imposes preconditions to\nthe provision of access, exchange, or use of EHI. However, we recognized that direct-to-\nconsumer health IT products and services are a growing sector of the health IT market. The\nprivacy practices of consumer-facing health IT products and services are typically regulated\nby the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). However, while the FTC Act prohibits\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1)), it does\nnot prescribe specific privacy requirements.165\nWe proposed that where a health IT developer of certified health IT offers a health IT\nproduct or service not regulated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, such product or service is still\nsubject to the information blocking provision. We wanted to ensure that such non-covered\nactors under the information blocking provisions are able to avail themselves of the Privacy\nException. As such, we proposed that an entity that is not covered by HIPAA will not engage\nin information blocking if the actor declines to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI where\nthe practice implements a process that is described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy\n165\nSee HHS, Examining Oversight of the Privacy & Security of Health Data Collected by Entities Not Regulated by\nHIPAA, https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non-covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nand has been disclosed to any individual or entity that uses the actor’s health IT. We proposed\nthis sub-exception in § 171.202(c) which sets forth additional detail (84 FR 7532).\n\nIn the final rule, we have finalized that when engaging in a practice that promotes the\nprivacy interests of an individual, the non-covered actor must implement the practice\naccording to a process described in the organizational privacy policies, disclosed those\norganizational privacy policies to the individuals and entities that use the actor’s product or\nservice before they agreed to use them, and the non-covered actor’s organizational privacy\npolicies must: (1) comply with applicable State or Federal laws; (2) be tailored to the specific\nprivacy risk or interest being addressed; and (3) be implemented in a consistent and non-\ndiscriminatory manner. Public comments on specific conditions are summarized below, in\ncontext of each condition proposed. We believe our responses to these comments furnish the\nclarity non-covered actors need to understand the conditions of the sub-exception finalized in\n§ 171.202(c).\n\nPractice must implement privacy policy\nWe proposed that in order to qualify for this sub-exception, the practice engaged in by\nthe non-covered actor—the interference with access, exchange, or use of EHI—must also\nimplement a process described in the actor’s organizational privacy policy. This requires that a\nnon-covered actor must have documented in detail in its organizational privacy policy the\nprocesses and procedures that the actor will use to determine when the actor will not provide\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI. For example, we explained that a non-covered actor that\nproposed to require the provision of written consent for the use or disclosure of EHI would\nneed to describe in its organizational privacy policy the processes and procedures to be\nutilized by the actor to implement that privacy-protective practice so that the practice be\nconsidered reasonable and necessary and qualify for this sub-exception. We noted that\n\n\n\n\ncompliance with this condition ensures that the sub-exception recognizes only legitimate\npractices that have been tailored to the privacy needs of the individuals that use the non-\ncovered actor’s health IT, and does not recognize practices that are a pretext or after-the-fact\nrationalization for actions that interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\nWe also proposed that the non-covered actor’s practice must implement its\ndocumented organizational privacy policy. We noted that practices that diverge from an\nactor’s documented policies, or which are not addressed in an actor’s organizational privacy\npolicy, would not qualify for this proposed sub-exception (84 FR 7532).\n\nPolicies must have been disclosed to users\nWe proposed that a non-covered actor that seeks to benefit from the sub-exception\nmust also ensure that it has previously disclosed the privacy-protective practice to the\nindividuals and entities that use, or will use, the health IT. These users are affected by the\npractices engaged in by a non-covered actor but may otherwise have no visibility of the non-\ncovered actor’s approach to protecting the privacy of EHI. We noted that we expect that non-\ncovered actors will seek to satisfy this condition by using a privacy notice.166\nWe emphasized\nthat the disclosure must be meaningful. In assessing whether a non-covered actor’s disclosure\nwas meaningful, we explained that regard will be paid to whether the disclosure was in plain\nlanguage and conspicuous, including whether the disclosure was located in a place, and\npresented in a manner, that is accessible and obvious to the individuals and entities that use, or\nwill use, the health IT.\n\n166\nONC has provided a Model Privacy Notice (MPN) that is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help\ndevelopers clearly convey information about their privacy and security policies to their users. The MPN provides a\nsnapshot of a company’s existing privacy practices encouraging transparency and helping consumers make informed\nchoices when selecting products. The MPN does not mandate specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive\nor detailed privacy policies. See https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/model-privacy-notice-\nmpn.\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed that to qualify for this sub-exception, a non-covered actor would not be\nrequired to disclose its organizational privacy policy to its customers or to the public\ngenerally. Rather, the non-covered actor need only describe, with sufficient detail and\nprecision to be readily understood by users of the non-covered actor’s health IT, the privacy-\nprotective practices that the non-covered actor has adopted and will observe. We explained\nthat this is necessary because a non-covered actor that is not subject to prescribed privacy\nstandards in connection with the provision of health IT will have significant flexibility in the\nprivacy-protective practices that it adopts. If a non-covered actor is not required to inform the\nindividuals and entities that use, or will use, the health IT, about the privacy-protective\npractices that it will implement in its product, or when providing its service, we noted that\nthere is a risk that the sub-exception will give deference to policies and processes that are post\nhoc rationalizations used to justify improper practices. We stated that this condition also\nserves as a check on the nature of the interferences that a non-covered actor writes into its\norganizational privacy policies; transparency will help to ensure that a non-covered actor takes\na balanced approach to protecting privacy interests on one hand, and pursuing business\ninterests that might be inconsistent with the information blocking provision, on the other hand\n(84 FR 7533).\n\nWe proposed that it will be a matter for non-covered actors to determine the most\nappropriate way to communicate its privacy practices to users. We noted that it would be\nreasonable that non-covered actors would, at a minimum, post their privacy notices, or\notherwise describe their privacy-protective practices, on their websites (84 FR 7533).\n\nPractice must be tailored to privacy risk and implemented in a non-discriminatory\nmanner.\n\nFinally, we proposed that in order for a practice to qualify for this sub-exception, an\n\n\n\n\nactor’s practice must be tailored to the specific privacy risks that the practice actually\naddresses and must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nWe requested comment on this proposed sub-exception generally. Specifically, we\nrequested comment on whether HIEs or HINs would benefit from a similar sub-exception. We\nalso requested comment on whether the conditions applicable to this sub-exception are\nsufficient to ensure that non-covered actors cannot take advantage of the exception by\nengaging in practices that are inconsistent with the promotion of individual privacy. We also\nrequested comment on the level of detail that non-covered actors should be required to use\nwhen describing their privacy practices and processes to user of health IT (84 FR 7533).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters believed that this sub-exception could be helpful for\nthose developing their own health IT tools, which are outside of the electronic health record.\n\n*Response.* We agree that this sub-exception would be helpful for those developing\ntheir own health IT tools. The sub-exception address those certified Health IT products not\ncovered by HIPAA and would have in place an organizational privacy policy which is tailored\nto a specific privacy risk or interest.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters noted that regarding the sub-exception proposed for “non-\ncovered actors” that develop patient-facing health IT, they urged the need to balance the\nconditions of this sub-exception with the requirements placed on actors who institute\norganizational privacy policies.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comment. In order to meet this sub-exception, the\norganizational privacy policies of a non-covered actor would need to comply with other\napplicable State and Federal laws. Further, we have finalized that non-covered actors that\nseek to benefit from this sub-exception must also ensure that their organizational privacy\npolicies are disclosed to the individuals and entities that use their product or service before\n\n\n\n\nthe individuals and entities agree to use them. The organizational privacy policies are\nimportant for transparency for users of the certified technologies and to demonstrate\ncompliance with applicable State and Federal laws. Non-covered actors have the discretion to\ndetermine the most appropriate way to communicate their privacy policies to individuals and\nusers. As stated above and in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7533), it would be reasonable for non-\ncovered actors to, at a minimum, post their privacy notices, or otherwise describe their\nprivacy-protective practices, on their websites.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters stated that it is unclear whether application developers\nare subject to HIPAA if they are not business associates or covered entities.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. Where application developers are not defined\nas a covered entity or business associate as defined under 45 CFR 160.103, then the\napplication developer is not covered under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or HIPAA Security Rule.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern that data will be made available to\nthird-party application suppliers, commercial analytics companies, and/or entities that are not\ngoverned by HIPAA and that such availability of data would not serve patients’ best interests\nand could result in potential misuse of patient data.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback and agree that an actor who is a health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT that is not required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule\nmust comply with all applicable State and Federal laws, including the FTC Act. Further, such\nactors must have an organizational privacy policy that is tailored to the privacy risk or interest\nbeing addressed in order to meet this sub-exception. We emphasize that where a health IT\ndeveloper of certified health IT offers a health IT product or service not regulated by the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule, such product or service is subject to the information blocking provision.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that non-covered actors that engage in reasonable and necessary privacy-\n\n\n\n\nprotective practices that interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI could seek\ncoverage under the sub-exception.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters stated that actors that are not covered by HIPAA should\nmake their privacy policies publicly available. Other commenters did not believe that the\nProposed Rule fully addressed patient and consumer privacy protections.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the comments. We believe that it is important that users\nknow what to expect when electing to use a non-covered actor’s product or service.\n\nSub-exception 3: Denial of an individual’s request for their electronic protected health\ninformation in the circumstances provided in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) and (2)\nWe proposed a limited sub-exception to the information blocking provision that would\npermit a covered entity or business associate to deny an individual’s request for access to their\nPHI in the circumstances provided under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) (2) and (3). We noted that this\nexception would avoid a potential conflict between the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the\ninformation blocking provision. Specifically, the HIPAA Privacy Rule contemplates\ncircumstances under which covered entities, and in some instances business associates, may\ndeny an individual access to PHI and distinguishes those grounds for denial which are\nreviewable from those which are not. We proposed that this exception applies to both the\n“unreviewable grounds” and “reviewable grounds” of access. We noted that the\n“unreviewable grounds” for denial for individuals include situations involving: (1) certain\nrequests that are made by inmates of correctional institutions; (2) information created or\nobtained during research that includes treatment, if certain conditions are met; (3) denials\npermitted by the Privacy Act; and (4) information obtained from non-health care providers\npursuant to promises of confidentiality. In addition, we noted that two categories of\ninformation are expressly excluded from the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual right of access:\n\n\n\n\n(1) psychotherapy notes, which are the notes recorded by a health care provider who is a\nmental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a\nprivate counseling session and that are maintained separate from the rest of the patient’s\nmedical record; and (2) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a\ncivil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding.167\nWe noted the “reviewable grounds” of access as described in § 164.524(a)(3), which\nprovides that a covered entity may deny access provided that the individual is given a right to\nhave such denials reviewed under certain circumstances. We explained that one such\ncircumstance is when a licensed health care professional, in the exercise of professional\njudgment, determines that the access requested is reasonably likely to endanger the life or\nphysical safety of the individual or another person. In addition, we noted that if access is\ndenied, then the individual has the right to have the denial reviewed by a licensed health\nprofessional who is to act as a reviewing official and did not participate in the original\ndecision to deny access (see generally 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3)) (84 FR 7533 and 7534).\n\nAs mentioned above with regards to the harm exception (§ 171.201) our purpose is to\navoid unnecessary complexity. By including the “reviewable grounds” of 45 CFR\n164.524(a)(3) in the harm exception at § 171.201, we align these regulations in a way that\nstreamlines compliance for actors subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and this regulation. We\nremoved the 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3) reference in the privacy sub-exception in § 171.202(d) and\nmoved it to the harm exception in § 171.201 in order to promote clarity and alignment with\nthe inter-relationship between this final rule and the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n\nIn restricting this privacy sub-exception to only “unreviewable grounds” in 45 CFR\n167\nSee 45 CFR 164.501; 45 CFR 164.524 (a)(1)(i) and (ii).\n\n\n\n\n164.524(a)(1) and (2), we clarify the regulation text so that it is immediately clear that actors\nwho are covered entities, and in some instances business associates, may deny an individual\naccess to EHI of the individual and such denials would not provide an opportunity for review\nof the denial under certain circumstances. We clarify in the final rule that if an individual\nrequests EHI under the right of access provision under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) from an actor\nthat must comply with 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), the actor’s practice must be consistent with 45\nCFR 164.524(a)(2). These “unreviewable grounds” are related to specific privacy risks or\ninterests and have been established for important public policy purposes, such as when a\nhealth care provider is providing treatment in the course of medical research or when a health\ncare provider is acting under the direction of a correctional institution.\n\nUnlike the “unreviewable grounds,” the “reviewable grounds” that are finalized §\n171.201 are directly related to the likelihood of harm to a patient or another person and\nrequires that actors seeking to avail themselves of this exception must have a reasonable belief\nthat the practice will substantially reduce a risk of harm that would otherwise arise from the\nspecific access, use, or exchange of EHI affected by the practice, and the harm must be one\nthat would be cognizable under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3) as a basis for denying an individual’s\nright of access to their PHI in analogous circumstances. In other words, the “reviewable\ngrounds” of access as described in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(3), provides that a covered entity may\ndeny access provided that the individual is given a right to have such denials reviewed when a\nlicensed health care professional, in the exercise of professional judgment, determines that the\naccess requested is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or\nanother person. In addition, we noted that if access is denied, then the individual has the right\nto have the denial reviewed by a licensed health professional who is to act as a reviewing\nofficial and did not participate in the original decision to deny access and the risk to be\n\n\n\n\nreduced must be one that would otherwise arise from the specific access, use, or exchange of\nEHI affected by the practice.\n\nWe proposed that if an actor who is a covered entity or its business associate denies an\nindividual’s request for access to their PHI on the basis of these unreviewable grounds, and\nprovided that the denial of access complies with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule\nin each case, then the actor would qualify for this exception and these practices would not\nconstitute information blocking (84 FR 7534).\n\nWe requested comment on this proposed sub-exception.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters were concerned that HINs that are business associates may\nnot be authorized to provide individual access on the behalf of covered entity. Further,\ncommenters sought clarification that this sub-exception would also apply in circumstances\nwhere as a business associate, the HIN would deny the individual’s request for access because\nof its obligations as a business associate.\n\n*Response.* We share this concern. To meet this privacy sub-exception, if an individual\nrequests their ePHI under 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), the actor may deny the request in the\ncircumstances provided in 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) or (2). That is, an actor that is a covered\nentity may deny an individual’s request for access to all or a portion of the PHI and must meet\nits requirements under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. As we discussed earlier, an individual’s right\nunder the HIPAA Privacy Rule to access PHI about themselves includes PHI in a designated\nrecord set maintained by a business associate on behalf of a covered entity. However, if the\nsame PHI that is the subject of an access request is maintained in both the designated record\nset of the covered entity and the designated record set of the business associate, the PHI need\n\n\n\n\nonly be produced once in response to the request for access.168\nComments. Commenters requested clarification that covered entities and business\nassociates could meet this sub-exception when conducting clinical research with a blinded or\nmasked designed. The EHI is typically ‘tagged’ as part of a blinded or masked research during\na research study.\n\n*Response.* To meet this privacy sub-exception, if an individual requests their ePHI\nunder 45 CFR 164.524(a)(1), the actor may deny the request in the circumstances provided in\n45 CFR 164.524(a)(1) or (2). Under certain limited circumstances under the Privacy Rule, a\ncovered entity may deny an individual’s request for access to all or a portion of the PHI\nrequested. In some of these circumstances, an individual does not a right to have the denial\nreviewed by a licensed health care professional. It is known as “unreviewable grounds” for\ndenial.169\nOne of the “unreviewable grounds” involves individual access to ePHI in a research\nstudy. An actor may deny access to an individual provided that the requested PHI is in a\ndesignated record set that is part of a research study that includes treatment (e.g., clinical trial)\nand is still in progress, provided the individual agreed to the temporary suspension of access\nwhen consenting to participate in the research. The individual’s right of access can be\nreinstated upon completion of the research study.\n\nSub-exception 4: Sub-exception: Respecting an individual’s request not to share\ninformation\nWe proposed to establish an exception to the information blocking provision that\nwould, in certain circumstances, permit an actor not to provide access, exchange, or use of\nEHI if an individual has specifically requested that the actor not do so. This sub-exception was\n168\n45 CFR 164.524(c)(1).\n\n169\n45 CFR 164.524(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\nproposed in § 171.202(e). We noted that this sub-exception is necessary to ensure that actors\nare confident that they can respect individuals’ privacy choices without engaging in\ninformation blocking, and to promote public confidence in the health IT infrastructure by\neffectuating patients’ preference about how and under what circumstances their EHI will be\naccessed, exchanged, and used. We recognized in the Proposed Rule that individuals may\nhave concerns about permitting their EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used electronically\nunder certain circumstances. As a matter of public policy, we explained that these privacy\nconcerns, if expressed by an individual and agreed to by an actor, would be reasonable and\nnecessary, and an actor’s conduct in abiding by its agreement would, if all conditions are met,\nbe an exception to the information blocking provision (84 FR 7534).\n\nWe proposed that this proposed sub-exception would not apply under circumstances\nwhere an actor interferes with a use or disclosure of EHI that is required by law, including\nwhen EHI is required by the Secretary to enforce HIPAA under 45 CFR 164.502(a)(2)(ii) and\n45 CFR 164.502(a)(4)(i). Stated differently, this sub-exception would not operate to permit an\nactor to refuse to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI when that access, exchange, or use\nis required by law. We noted that this sub-exception recognizes and supports the public policy\nobjective of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which identifies uses and disclosures of EHI for which\nthe public interest in the disclosure of the individual’s information outweighs the individual’s\ninterests in controlling the information.\n\nWe proposed that this sub-exception would permit an actor not to share EHI if the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1) the individual made the request to the actor not to have their\nEHI accessed, exchanged, or used; (2) the individual’s request was initiated by the individual\nwithout any improper encouragement or inducement by the actor; and (3) the actor or its agent\ndocuments the request within a reasonable time period.\n\n\n\n\nWe described that to qualify for this sub-exception, the request that the individual’s\nEHI not be accessed, exchanged, or used must come from the individual. Moreover, the\nindividual must have made the request independently and without any improper\nencouragement or inducement by the actor.\n\nWe proposed that if an individual submits a request to an actor not to disclose her EHI,\nand the actor agrees with and documents the request, the request would be valid for purposes\nof this sub-exception unless and until it is subsequently revoked by the individual. We\nproposed that once the individual makes the request, she should not, subject to the\nrequirements of applicable Federal or State laws and regulations, have to continually reiterate\nher privacy preferences, such as having to re-submit a request every year. Likewise, we\nproposed that once the actor has documented an individual’s request, the actor should not have\nto repeatedly reconfirm and re-document the request. We requested comment, however,\nregarding whether this approach is too permissive and could result in unintended\nconsequences. We also sought comment on this proposed sub-exception generally, including\non effective ways for an individual to revoke their privacy request for purposes of this sub-\nexception.\n\nWe also proposed that in order for a practice to qualify for this sub-exception, an\nactor’s practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. This\ncondition would provide basic assurance that the purported privacy practice is directly related\nto the risk of disclosing EHI contrary to the wishes of an individual, and is not being used to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this exception does\nnot apply. We noted that this condition requires that the actor’s privacy-protective practice\nmust be based on objective criteria that apply uniformly for all substantially similar privacy\nrisks (84 FR 7534 and 7535).\n\n\n\n\nWe noted that under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, individuals have the right to request\nrestrictions on how a covered entity will use (as that term is defined in 45 CFR 160.103) and\ndisclose PHI about them for treatment, payment, and health care operations pursuant to 45\nCFR 164.522(a)(1). Under 45 CFR 164.522(a), a covered entity is not required to agree to an\nindividual’s request for a restriction (other than in the case of a disclosure to a health plan\nunder 45 CFR 164.522(a)(1)(vi)), but is bound by any restrictions to which it agrees (84 FR\n7534).\n\nWe proposed that if an individual submitted a request to an actor not to disclose her\nEHI, and the actor agreed with and documents the request, the request would be valid for the\npurposes of this sub-exception unless and until it was subsequently revoked by the individual.\n\nWe believed that this approach would minimize compliance burdens for actors while also\nrespecting individuals’ requests. We sought comment on this proposed sub-exception\ngenerally, including on effective ways for individuals to revoke their privacy request for\npurposes of this sub-exception (84 FR 7534). In the final rule, we align with the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule, specifically, 45 CFR 164.522(a)(2) which includes specific requirements with\nrespect to the termination of an individual’s restriction. Similar to the HIPAA Privacy Rule,\nwe include § 171.202(e)(4) to address situations where the individual terminates its\nindividual’s restriction.\n\nAn actor may terminate a restriction with the individual’s written or oral agreement. If\nthe individual’s agreement is obtained orally, the actor must document that agreement. A note\nin the certified EHR or similar notation is sufficient documentation. If the individual agrees to\nterminate the restriction, the actor may use and disclose EHI as otherwise permitted under this\nfinal rule. An actor may only access, exchange or use EHI after it informs the individual of the\ntermination. The restriction continues to apply to EHI accessed, exchanged or used prior to\n\n\n\n\ninforming the individual of the termination. That is, any EHI that had been collected before\nthe termination may not be accessed, exchanged or used in a way that is inconsistent with the\nrestriction, but any information that is collected after informing the individual of the\ntermination of the restriction may be used or disclosed as otherwise permitted under the final\nrule. In § 171.201(e)(4), we clarify that an actor must document a restriction to which it has\nagreed. We do not require a specific form of documentation; a note in the certified EHR or\nsimilar notation is sufficient.\n\nA restriction is only binding on the actor that agreed to the restriction. We encourage\nactors to inform others of the existence of a restriction when it is appropriate to do so. If a\nrestriction does not permit an actor to disclose EHI to a particular person, the actor must\ncarefully consider whether disclosing the existence of the restriction to that person would also\nviolate the restriction.\n\nWe clarified that for the purposes of this proposed sub-exception, the actor may give\neffect to an individual’s request not to have an actor disclose EHI even if State or Federal laws\nwould allow the actor not to follow the individual’s request. We explained that this is\nconsistent with our position that, absent improper encouragement or inducement, and subject\nto appropriate conditions, it should not be considered information blocking to give effect to\npatients’ individual preferences about how their EHI will be shared or how their EHI will not\nbe shared.\n\nWe requested comments on this sub-exception generally. Specifically, we sought\ncomment on what would be considered a reasonable time frame for documentation. In\naddition, we also sought comment on how this sub-exception would affect public health\ndisclosures and health care research, if an actor did not share a patient’s EHI due to a privacy\npreference, including any effects on preventing or controlling diseases, injury, or disability,\n\n\n\n\nand the reporting of disease, injury, and vital events such as births or deaths, and the conduct\nof public health surveillance and health care research (84 FR 7534 and 7535).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended that we provide guidance regarding what could\nbe considered a “reasonable time period” under § 171.202(e)(3) and to provide clarity to\nhealth information professionals that will be tasked with documenting the individual’s privacy\npreferences in accordance with this regulation.\n\n*Response.* In order to align with HIPAA, we looked to the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45\nCFR 164.522 for guidance on this issue. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires a covered entity to\ndocument a restriction of PHI, but gives covered entities the discretion to determine the exact\ntiming of the documentation. The documentation requirement is consistent with the HIPAA\nPrivacy Rule, which is already being observed by covered entities and business associates.\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may voluntarily choose, but is not\nrequired, to obtain the individual’s consent for it to use and disclose information about him or\nher for treatment, payment, and health care operations.170\nA “consent” document is not a valid\npermission to use or disclose PHI for a purpose that requires an “authorization” under the\nHIPAA Privacy Rule (see 45 CFR 164.508), or where other requirements or conditions exist\nunder the HIPAA Privacy Rule for the use or disclosure of PHI.\n\nSimilarly, we believe that actors should be given the discretion to document an\nindividual’s request and such documentation should be within a reasonable period of time\nafter making such a request. Although we do not require the request form to be dated at the\ntime it is signed, we would recommend that it be dated so that actors and others can document\nthat the request was obtained prior to an actor’s agreement for the restriction of the\n170\nSee 45 CFR 164.506(b).\n\n\n\n\nindividual’s access, exchange or use of EHI. What would be deemed as an unreasonable\nperiod of time would be the unreasonable delay in performance and in documentation by the\nactor as well as whether there were any objective manifestations of expectation expressed\nbetween the individual and the actor.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended that a reasonable time frame should balance\nand not burden an individual or organization such as reviewing preferences with the individual\neach year and that the risk/benefit profile in the fast-changing health-IT market may well have\nchanged and that the individual has a right to have those changes disclosed to make an\ninformed decision. Another commenter expressed a belief that not asking the individual to\nreconfirm their preference is too permissive.\n\n*Response.* We agree that once the individual makes the request to an actor, she should\nnot, subject to the requirements of applicable Federal or State laws and regulations, have to\ncontinually reiterate her privacy preferences, such as having to re-submit a request every year.\n\nLikewise, we finalized that once the actor has documented an individual’s request within a\nreasonable period of time, then the actor is not required to repeatedly reconfirm and re-\ndocument the request.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended that the request needs to be in writing, and\nsuggested that we provide guidance regarding how the individual’s request could be\ndocumented. Another commenter requested that we develop a template consent form whereby\npatients could indicate if they would like to have their health information disclosed to third\nparties and to ensure that the content of this form would be absent of any “improper\nencouragement or inducement” and that we should work in consultation with OCR to develop\nthe recommended language for a model consent form.\n\n*Response.* We agree that an individual’s request and an individual’s request for\n\n\n\n\nrevocation should be in writing assuming such a request is not required or prohibited by law.\n\nAlternatively, an actor could document a conversation with an individual. Such documentation\ncould be documented in a certified EHR in some manner, and if the individual was provided a\nspecific request form, the form could be included in a certified EHR. We believe that an\nindividual should have sufficient opportunity to consider whether to provide a request and that\nan actor should minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence and refrain from any\nimproper encouragement or inducement. Any form provided by the actor should have\ninformation provided in plain language that is understandable to the individual.\n\nFor example, we noted that it would be improper to discourage individuals from\nsharing information with unaffiliated providers on the basis of generalized or speculative risks\nof unauthorized disclosure. On the other hand, we noted that if the actor was aware of a\nspecific privacy or security risk, it would be proper to inform individuals of that risk.\n\nLikewise, an actor would be permitted to provide an individual with general information about\nher privacy rights and options, including for example, the option to not provide consent,\nprovided the information is presented accurately, does not omit important information, and is\nnot presented in a way that is likely to improperly influence the individual’s decision about\nhow to exercise their rights.\n\nIt is important to note that the sub-exception conditions in the regulation are not\nintended to preempt any applicable Federal, State, or local laws that may require additional\ninformation to be disclosed for an agreement to be legally effective. We will continue to work\nin consultation with OCR to develop resources as necessary to support actors’ compliance\nwith the conditions of this Privacy Exception.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters requested greater clarity on how this regulation would affect\npublic health disclosures and health care research, if an actor did not share a patient’s EHI due\n\n\n\n\nto a privacy preference, including any effects on preventing or controlling diseases, injury, or\ndisability, and the reporting of disease, injury, and vital events such as births or deaths, and the\nconduct of public health surveillance and health care research.\n\n*Response.* With regard to public health disclosures, to the extent that such disclosures\nare required by law, the actor would not be in a position to grant the patient’s request for\nrestriction. With regard to EHI used for research, the unavailability of the individual’s\ninformation resulting from a restriction would be consistent with the patient’s right to\nwithhold authorization for research uses and disclosures. However, an Institutional Review\nBoard may approve a consent procedure that alters some or all of the elements of informed\nconsent, or waive the requirement to obtain informed consent under HHS regulations at 45\nCFR 46.116(c), and to the extent that the researcher has obtained a waiver of informed\nconsent, research could be compromised by the unavailability of certain EHI. One possible\nway to resolve this issue would be the establishment of a field that actors covered could check\nin a certified EHR that would indicate that restrictions have been applied to the individual’s\nEHI (without providing detail of the nature of such restriction). In this case, actors could\nexclude the individual’s EHI from research.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter suggested that EHI should be accessed, exchanged or used\ndespite a patient’s privacy agreement with an actor in emergency treatment situations\nparticularly when an individual is unavailable to provide a revocation. The commenter was\nconcerned that if the EHI was not disclosed to health care provider in an emergency, the\nindividual could be subject to imminent harm or death.\n\n*Response.* In the Proposed Rule (proposed § 171.202(e)), we did not provide how an\nindividual could revoke her privacy agreement with the actor. In response, we included in the\nfinal rule in § 171.202(e)(4) to specifically address the termination of an individual’s request.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to address these specific circumstances and align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we\nagree that an individual’s restriction may need to be compromised in emergency treatment\nsituations, and we have finalized that an actor may terminate an individual’s request for a\nrestriction to not provide access, exchange or use of EHI under limited circumstances.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7535 through 7538) to establish an\nexception to the information blocking provision that would permit actors to engage in\npractices that are reasonable and necessary to promote the security of EHI, subject to certain\nconditions. We explained that, without this exception, actors may be reluctant to implement\nsecurity measures or engage in other activities that are reasonable and necessary for\nsafeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI. This could undermine the\nultimate goals of the information blocking provision by discouraging best practice security\nprotocols and diminishing the reliability of the health IT ecosystem.\n\nWe noted (84 FR 7535) that robust security protections are critical to promoting\npatients’ and other stakeholders’ trust and confidence that EHI will be collected, used, and\nshared in a manner that protects individuals’ privacy and complies with applicable legal\nrequirements. We also noted that public confidence in the security of their EHI has been\nchallenged by the growing incidence of cyber-attacks in the health care sector. More than\never, we explained, health care providers, health IT developers, HIEs and HINs must be\nvigilant to mitigate security risks and implement appropriate safeguards to secure the EHI they\ncollect, maintain, access, use, and exchange.\n\n\n\n\nWe emphasized (84 FR 7535) that, while the importance of security practices cannot\nbe overstated, the proposed exception would not apply to all practices that purport to secure\nEHI. Rather, we stated that the exception would only be available when the actor’s security-\nbased practice satisfies the conditions applicable to this exception.171\nWe noted that it would\nnot be appropriate to prescribe a “maximum” level of security or to dictate a one-size-fits-all\napproach for all actors as that may not be appropriate in all circumstances and may not\naccommodate new threats, countermeasures, and best practices in a rapidly changing security\nlandscape. We further noted that we did not intend for the proposed exception to dictate a\nspecific security approach. Moreover, we emphasized that effective security best practices\nfocus on the mitigation and remediation of risks to a reasonable and acceptable level.\n\nWith consideration of the above (84 FR 7535), we proposed that actors would be able\nto satisfy the exception through practices that implement either security policies and practices\ndeveloped by the actor, or case-by-case determinations made by the actor. We proposed that\nwhether a security-motivated practice meets this exception would be determined on a case-by-\ncase basis using a fact-based analysis of the conditions set forth in the Proposed Rule.\n\nWe emphasized (84 FR 7535) that the practices implemented by a single physician\noffice with limited technology resources, for example, will be different to those implemented\nby a large health system, and that this difference does not affect an actor’s ability to qualify\nfor this exception. The fact-based approach that we proposed would allow each actor to\nimplement policies, procedures, and technologies that are appropriate for its particular size,\norganizational structure, and risks to individuals’ EHI. We noted that a fact-based analysis\n171\nIn the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7535), we used the phrase “conditions applicable to this exception” to mean the\nconditions (inclusive of requirements within specific conditions) of the exception applicable to a particular practice\nin a particular circumstance. Where we are not summarizing what we stated in the proposed rule, in this preamble\nwe have generally used plainer-language phrasings, such as “the conditions of the exception that are applicable to a\npractice [in the particular circumstances].”\n\n\n\n\nalso aligns with the HIPAA Security Rule172\nconcerning the security of ePHI. The HIPAA\nSecurity Rule requires HIPAA covered entities or business associates to develop security\npractices and implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that take into\naccount: the entity’s size, complexity, and capabilities; technical, hardware, and software\ninfrastructure; the costs of security measures; and the likelihood and possible impact of\npotential risks to ePHI.173\nWe noted (84 FR 7535 and 7536), however, that while our proposed\napproach would be consistent with the regulation of security practices under the HIPAA\nSecurity Rule, the fact that a practice complies with the HIPAA Security Rule would not\nestablish that it meets the conditions of the exception to the information blocking provision.\n\nWe emphasized (84 FR 7536) that the HIPAA Security Rule and the proposed exception have\ndifferent foci. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes a baseline by requiring certain entities to\nensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI by implementing security\nmeasures, among other safeguards, that the entities determine are sufficient to reduce risks and\nvulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level. In contrast, we explained that the purpose\nof the exception to the information blocking provision is to provide flexibility for reasonable\nand necessary security practices without excepting from the definition of information blocking\nin § 171.103 practices that purport to promote the security of EHI but that are unreasonably\nbroad and onerous on those seeking access to EHI, not applied consistently across or within an\norganization, or otherwise may unreasonably interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI.\n\nTo qualify for this exception, we proposed that an actor’s conduct must satisfy\nthreshold conditions. As discussed in detail in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7535 through 7538),\nthe particular security-related practice must be directly related to safeguarding the\n172\n45 CFR 164.306, 308, 310, and 312.\n\n173\n45 CFR 164.306 (b)\n\n\n\n\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI, implemented consistently and in a non-\ndiscriminatory manner, and tailored to identified security risks (84 FR 7535). We also\nproposed (84 FR 7537) that where an actor has documented security policies that align with\napplicable consensus-based standards, and where the policies are implemented in a consistent\nand non-discriminatory manner, a practice’s conformity with such policies would provide a\ndegree of assurance that the practice was reasonable and necessary to address specific security\nrisks and thus should not constitute information blocking. We also stated in the Proposed Rule\n(84 FR 7537) that we recognize that EHI security may present novel and unexpected threats\nthat even a best-practice risk assessment and security policy cannot anticipate. We stated that\nif a practice that does not implement an organizational security policy is to qualify for this\nexception; however, it must meet certain conditions. The public comments received, our\nresponses to these comments, and the conditions as finalized in § 171.203 are discussed below\nin this section of this final rule preamble.\n\nWe encouraged comment on these conditions (84 FR 7538), and our overall approach\nto the proposed exception, including whether our proposal provided adequate flexibility for\nactors to implement measures that are commensurate to the threats they face, the technology\ninfrastructure they possess, and their overall security profiles and, equally important, whether\nthis exception adequately mitigates the risk that actors will adopt security policies that are\nunnecessarily restrictive or engage in practices that unreasonably interfere with access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. Commenters were encouraged to propose additional conditions that\nmay be necessary to ensure that the exception is tailored and does not extend protection to\npractices that are not reasonable and necessary to promote the security of EHI and that could\npresent information blocking concerns. We also requested comment on whether the use of\nconsensus-based standards and guidance provides an appropriate reference point for the\n\n\n\n\ndevelopment of security policies.\n\nFinally, we asked commenters to offer an alternative basis for identifying practices that\ndo not offer a security benefit (compared with available alternatives) but that cause an\ninformation blocking harm by interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI (84 FR 7538).\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments supporting, and did not receive any\ncomments opposed to, the establishment of the Security Exception. We also received no\ncomments offering an alternative basis for identifying practices that do not offer a security\nbenefit (compared with other available alternatives) but that cause an information blocking\nharm by interfering with access, exchange, or use of EHI to a greater degree than necessary.\n\nWe received a number of comments requesting additional guidance about how the exception’s\nconditions can be met in practice. Commenters asked questions about, or recommended that\nwe furnish additional guidance on how an actor might determine which a security practices\nmeet the conditions in § 171.203 to qualify for the exception.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ feedback. We have finalized the exception in §\n171.203, with some modification to the regulation text. We have changed the title of the\nexception from “Exception—Promoting the security of electronic health information” in the\nProposed Rule (84 FR 7603) to “Security Exception — When will a practice likely to interfere\nwith access, exchange, or use of electronic health information in order to protect the security\nof electronic health information not be considered information blocking?” Throughout this\nfinal rule preamble, we use “Security Exception” as a short form of this title, for ease of\nreference. As stated in Section VIII.D of this final rule preamble, we have changed the titles of\nall of the exceptions to questions to improve clarity. We have edited the wording of the\nintroductory text of § 171.203 as finalized, in comparison to that proposed (84 FR 7603) so\nthat it is consistent with the finalized title of § 171.203. We believe these conforming changes\n\n\n\n\nin wording of the introductory text also improve clarity of expression in this section.\n\nComments on specific conditions are summarized below, in context of each condition\nproposed. We believe our responses to these comments furnish the clarity actors need to\nunderstand the conditions and of the exception finalized in § 171.203 for practices likely to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI in order to protect the security of EHI to be\nconsidered excepted from the definition of information blocking in § 171.103.\n\nCondition: the practice must be directly related to safeguarding the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability of electronic health information\nWe proposed that, as a threshold condition, the exception would not apply to practices\nthat are not directly related (84 FR 7536) to safeguarding the security of EHI. We explained\nthat, in assessing the practice, we would consider whether and to what extent the practice\ndirectly addressed specific security risks or concerns. We noted that we would also consider\nwhether the practice served any other purposes and, if so, whether those purposes were merely\nincidental to the overriding security purpose or provided an objectively distinct, non-security-\nrelated rationale for engaging in the practice.\n\nWe noted (84 FR 7536) that it should not be particularly difficult or onerous for an\nactor to demonstrate that its practice was directly related to a specific security risk or concern.\n\nFor example, we explained that the actor may show that the practice was a direct response to a\nknown security incident or threat; or that the practice directly related to the need to verify a\nperson’s identity before granting access to EHI; or that the practice was directly related to\nensuring the integrity of EHI.\n\nWe emphasized (84 FR 7536) that the salient issue under this condition, therefore,\nwould be whether the security practice was actually necessary and directly related to the\nspecific security risk being addressed. To that end, we noted that we would consider the\n\n\n\n\nactor’s purported basis for adopting the particular security practice, which could be evidenced\nby the actor’s organizational security policy, risk assessments, and other relevant\ndocumentation, which most actors are already required to develop pursuant to requirements\nunder the HIPAA Rules. However, we proposed that the documentation of an actor’s decision\nmaking would not necessarily be dispositive. For example, we noted that if the practice had\nthe practical effect of disadvantaging competitors or steering referrals, this could be evidence\nthat the practice was not directly related and tailored to the specific security risk. We proposed\nthat such an inference would also not be warranted where the actor has not met the other\nconditions of this exception, as where the actor’s policies were not developed or implemented\nin a reasonable manner; its security policies or practices were not tailored to specific risks; or\nit applied its security policies or practices in an inconsistent or discriminatory manner.\n\n*Comments.* We received a number of comments supporting the applicability of this\nexception to practices directly related to safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of EHI and that are consistent with the HIPAA Security Rule. We received no\ncomments recommending that this exception not be applicable to such practices.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized this condition as proposed. In order to meet this specific\ncondition (finalized in § 171.203(a)), a practice must be directly related to safeguarding the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concerns with what commenters described as the\ncomplexity of fact-based analysis and use of terms such as “directly related.” Commenters\nstated that analyzing their policies and practices against such standards could be burdensome,\nespecially in the context of the requirement to meet all conditions at all relevant times.\n\n*Response.* While fact-based analysis may not be as simple as determining if a\nparticular security practice does or does not conform to a pre-specified approach, we believe\n\n\n\n\nthat it is the most practical approach given the inherent complexity of the regulatory and threat\nlandscapes relevant to an actor’s cybersecurity practices. This landscape complexity\ncontributes substantially to our belief that a one-size-fits-all detailed definition or test for\nsecurity measures or methods to be deemed “directly related” to safeguarding the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI would not be the optimal approach at this\ntime. We have not established a specific, regulatory definition for “directly related” as we are\nusing both “directly” and “related” in their ordinary meanings.174\nWith respect to the condition that a practice meet all conditions in § 171.203 at all\nrelevant times in order to satisfy the exception, we do not believe it would be particularly\ndifficult, in context of a fact-specific analysis, for an actor to demonstrate that its practice was\ndirectly related to a specific security risk or concern. For example, the actor may show that the\npractice was a direct response to a known security incident or threat, or that the practice was\ndirectly related to the need to verify a person’s identity before granting access to EHI. We also\nnote that, although we encourage actors to voluntarily conform their practices to the\nconditions of an exception suited to the practice and its purpose, an actor’s choice to do so\nsimply provides it an enhanced level of assurance that the practices do not meet the definition\nof information blocking. Failure to meet an exception does not necessarily mean a practice\nmeets the definition of information blocking. If subject to an investigation by HHS, each\npractice that implicates the information blocking provision and that does not meet any\nexception would be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe overarching purpose of the Security Exception is to provide flexibility for\n174\nOrdinary meanings of the adverb “directly” and the adjective “related” in American usage can be found in widely\npublished dictionaries, such as The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Dictionary.com, or\nMerriam-Webster.com.\n\n\n\n\nreasonable and necessary security practices while screening out practices that purport to\npromote the security of EHI but that otherwise unreasonably and/or unnecessarily interfere\nwith access, exchange, and use of EHI. Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known\nas the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information security practices\nwithin an organization. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial\ncomponents of information security practices.175\nIn assessing whether a practice meets the\ncondition finalized in § 171.203(a), the information that we would expect to consider includes,\nbut is not necessarily limited to, the actor’s purported basis for adopting the particular security\npractice, which could be evidenced by the actor’s organizational security policy, risks\nassessments the actor had performed that informed the actor’s security-based practice(s), and\nother relevant documentation that an actor maintains. We also reiterate our observation that\nmany actors are also HIPAA covered entities or business associates. For that reason, many\nactors are likely to have, pursuant to their meeting the requirements of the HIPAA Security\nRule, documentation relevant to showing their security-based practice(s) satisfy the Security\nException condition that is finalized in § 171.203(a).176\nCondition: The practice must be tailored to the specific security risk being addressed\nTo meet the exception, we proposed (84 FR 7536) that an actor’s security-related\npractice must be tailored to specific security risks that the practice actually addressed. We\nexplained that this condition necessarily presupposes that an actor has carefully evaluated the\nrisk posed by the security threat and developed a considered response that is tailored to\nmitigating the vulnerabilities of the actor’s health IT or other related systems.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed concerns with what commenters described as the\n175\nSee NIST Special Publication 800-12, revision 1, An Introduction to Information Security\n176\n45 CFR § 164.316\n\n\n\n\ncomplexity of fact-based analysis and use of terms such as “tailored.” Commenters stated that\nanalyzing their policies and practices against such standards could be burdensome, especially\nin context of the requirement to meet all conditions at all relevant times.\n\n*Response.* While fact-specific analysis may not be as simple as determining if a\nparticular security practice does or does not conform to a pre-specified approach, we believe\nthat it is the most practical approach given the inherent complexity of the regulatory and threat\nlandscapes relevant to an actor’s cybersecurity practices. This landscape complexity\ncontributes substantially to our belief that a one-size-fits-all definition or test for security\nmeasures or methods to be deemed conformant with the condition finalized in § 171.203(b)\nwould not be the optimal approach at this time. Instead, we have finalized the condition\nproposed in § 171.201(b) as proposed. We believe requiring that the actor’s policies and\npractices be tailored to the risk being addressed is currently the most appropriate and practical\napproach. We intend for this exception to be applicable to a wide array of practices that are\nreasonable and necessary to protect the security of EHI in various actors’ specific operational\ncontexts. In assessing whether a practice meets the condition finalized in § 171.203(b), we\nwould consider whether and to what extent the practice directly addresses specific security\nrisks or concerns and whether it was tailored to those risks. We would also consider whether\nthe practice served any other purposes and if so, whether those purposes were merely\nincidental to an overriding security purpose or provided an objectively distinct, non-security\nrelated rationale for engaging in the practice. We also believe the ordinary meaning of\n“tailored”177\nprovides sufficient clarity that we expect the practices to be made or adapted to\n177\nSee, e.g., sense 1.b. of the entry for the verb “tailor” in the Merriam-Webster dictionary: “to make or adapt to suit\na special need or purpose” (https://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tailor, last accessed Feb. 6, 2020). See also, e.g.,\nsense 3 of the entry for the verb “tailor” in The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: “to make,\n\n\n\n\nserve the particular purpose or need for which they are deployed. With respect to the\nrequirement that a practice meet all conditions in § 171.203 at all relevant times in order to\nsatisfy the exception, we do not believe it would be particularly difficult, in context of a fact-\nspecific analysis, for an actor to demonstrate that each practice was made or adapted to serve\nthe particular purpose or need for which is was deployed. For example, where a practice meets\nthe condition finalized in § 171.203(a) by being a direct response to a known security incident\nor threat, it logically follows that the practice should also be made or adapted to the purpose of\nresponding to such incident or threat. In which case, the practice’s inherent characteristics\nwould support the actor’s ability to show that it meets the condition finalized in § 171.203(b).\n\nSimilarly, where an identity-proofing practice satisfies the condition finalized in § 171.203(b)\nby being directly related to the need to verify a person’s identity before granting access to\nEHI, it would be logical to expect the practice would also be tailored to address that need.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters recommended that actors should be permitted to develop and\nimplement security policies that exceed the minimum requirements of HIPAA with the intent\nto promote data security or to comply with State law or policies.\n\n*Response.* If its conditions are otherwise met, this exception would apply to security-\nbased practices that exceed the minimum conditions of the HIPAA Security Rule. As would\nbe the case with a practice implemented to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule\nrequirements, the fact that a practice was implemented to meet another applicable legal\nmandate would be considered in assessing whether a practice meets this exception. However,\na practice that is consistent with a law or regulation setting a minimum requirement for\nprotecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EHI might not meet this exception. For\nalter, or adapt for a particular end or purpose” (https://ahdictionary.com, last accessed Feb 6, 2020).\n\n\n\n\nexample, a practice that is consistent with a minimum legal condition related to the security of\nEHI might not meet this exception if it is not also tailored to avoid interfering with the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI to a greater extent than reasonable and necessary to appropriately\nmitigate the risk it addresses.\n\nWe have finalized this condition in § 171.203(b) without modification to the text of\nthis condition as proposed (84 FR 7603).\n\nCondition: The practice must be implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory\nmanner\nWe proposed (84 FR 7536 and 7537) that in order for a practice to qualify for this\nexception, the actor’s practice must have been implemented in a consistent and non-\ndiscriminatory manner. We explained that this condition would provide basic assurance that\nthe purported security practice is directly related to a specific security risk and is not being\nused to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI for other purposes to which this\nexception does not apply.\n\nAs an illustration solely of the non-discriminatory manner condition (84 FR 7536 and\n7537), we discussed a hypothetical example of a health IT developer of certified health IT that\noffers apps to its customers via an app marketplace. We stated that if the developer requires\nthat third-party apps sold (or made available) via the developer’s app marketplace meet certain\nsecurity requirements, those security requirements must be imposed in a non-discriminatory\nmanner. We noted that this would mean, for example, that if a developer imposed a\nrequirement that third-party apps include two-factor authentication for patient access, the\ndeveloper would need to ensure that the same requirement was imposed on, and met by, all\nother apps, including any apps made available by the developer itself. We also noted that such\na developer requirement must also meet the other conditions of the exception (e.g., the\n\n\n\n\ncondition that the practice be tailored to the specific security risk being addressed).\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments opposed to the condition that practices must be\nimplemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. We did receive one comment\nrecommending that we recognize under this exception risk-based cybersecurity practices that\nmay result in applying different security requirements to different exchange partners based on\nrisk posed.\n\n*Response.* We intend this exception, including but not limited to this specific\ncondition, to allow for recognition of risk-based security practices. Assessment of whether\npractices satisfy the conditions of this exception will be fact-based. We also recognize that\nobjectively reasonable practices applied on the basis of the cybersecurity risks posed by\nparticular system connections or data exchanges may result in practices that are tailored to this\nrisk and thus not necessarily identical across all connections, interchanges, and therefore all\nindividuals or entities with whom an actor engages. In context of this condition of the Security\nException, “consistent and non-discriminatory” should be understood to mean that similarly\nsituated actors whose interactions pose the same level of security risk should be treated\nconsistently with one another under the actor’s security practices. Inconsistent treatment\nacross similarly situated actors whose interactions pose the same level of security risk based\non extraneous factors, such as whether they are a competitor of the actor implementing the\nsecurity practices, would not be considered appropriate.\n\nWe have finalized this condition as proposed. It is codified in § 171.203(c).\n\nCondition applicable to practices that implement an organizational security policy\nWe discussed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7537) that an actor’s approach to\ninformation security management would reflect the actor’s particular size, organizational\nstructure, and risk posture. Because of this, we emphasized that actors should develop and\n\n\n\n\nimplement organizational policies that secure EHI. We proposed that, where an actor has\ndocumented security policies that align with applicable consensus-based standards, and where\nthe policies are implemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner, a practice’s\nconformity with such policies would provide a degree of assurance that the practice was\nreasonable and necessary to address specific security risks and thus should not constitute\ninformation blocking.\n\nWe stated (84 FR 7537) that a practice that went beyond an actor’s established policies\nor procedures by imposing security controls that were not documented would not qualify for\nthis exception under this condition (although the actor may be able to qualify under the\nalternative basis for practices that do not implement a security policy). We further stated that\nsuch practices would be suspect under the information blocking provision if there were\nindications that the actor’s security-related justification was a pretext or after-the-fact\nrationalization for its conduct or was otherwise unreasonable under the circumstances.\n\nWe reiterated (84 FR 7537) that, to the extent that an actor seeks to justify a practice\non the basis of its organizational security policies, such policies must be in writing and\nimplemented in a consistent and non-discriminatory manner. We emphasized that what a\npolicy requires will depend on the facts and circumstances. However, we proposed that to\nsupport a presumption that a practice conducted pursuant to the actor’s security policy was\nreasonable, the policy would have to meet conditions stated and discussed in Section VIII.D.3\nof the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7537). The details within paragraph (d) of § 171.203 were\nproposed in regulation text (84 FR 7603). The detailed requirements of the condition as\nproposed in § 171.203(d) were: if the practice implements an organizational security policy\nthe policy must—\n Be in writing;\n\n\n\n\n Have been prepared on the basis of, and directly respond to, security risks identified\nand assessed by or on behalf of the actor;\n Align with one or more applicable consensus-based standards or best practice\nguidance; and\n Provide objective timeframes and other parameters for identifying, responding to, and\naddressing security incidents.\n\nWe discuss each of these requirements (subparagraphs) within the condition applicable\nto practices that implement an organizational security policy (§ 171.203(d)) in more detail\nbelow.\n\nParagraph (d)(1): Security Policy in Writing\nWe proposed that the actor’s security policy must be in writing (84 FR 7537). This\nrequirement is applicable to practices that implement an organizational security policy and is\nconsistent with the HIPAA Security Rule.178\nThe importance of written security policies is\nalso consistent with consensus-based standard and best practice guidance.179\nComments. We received no comments opposed to this condition proposed in §\n171.203(d).\n\n*Response.* Within the condition (§ 171.203(d)) applicable to practices that implement\nan organizational security policy, we have finalized in § 171.203(d)(1) the requirement that\nthe policy must be in writing. We have finalized this condition as proposed.\n\nParagraph (d)(2): Security Risks identified and assessed\nWe proposed (84 FR 7537) that the actor’s security policy must be informed by an\nassessment of the security risks facing the actor. While we did not propose any requirements\n178\n45 CFR 164.316\n179\nSee SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations\n\n\n\n\nas to a risk assessment, we noted that a good risk assessment would use an approach\nconsistent with industry standards,180\nand would incorporate elements such as threat and\nvulnerability analysis, data collection, assessment of current security measures, likelihood of\noccurrence, impact, level of risk, and final reporting.181\nComments. We received no comments opposed to requiring a linkage between an\norganization’s security policy and a risk assessment. We did receive a couple of comments\nexpressing a concern that not all actors may yet be proficient in identifying and assessing the\nrisks associated with specific health IT functionalities, such as standards-based APIs.\n\n*Response.* Within the condition (§ 171.203(d)) applicable to practices that implement\nan organizational security policy, we have finalized § 171.203(d)(2) with a revision to the\nwording of the regulation text in comparison with that proposed (84 FR 7603). Specifically,\nwe have replaced “and respond directly to” that appeared in the regulation text with “and be\ndirectly responsive to” in the text finalized in § 171.203(d)(2). Thus, the finalized text in §\n171.203(d)(2) reads: “have been prepared on the basis of, and be directly responsive to,\nsecurity risks identified and assessed by or on behalf of the actor.”\n\nWe made this editorial revision because we believe it makes the resulting regulation\ntext easier to read. Although actors may have obligations under other existing law or\nregulations, such as the HIPAA Security Rule, to conduct security risk assessments, this\ncondition, which is applicable to security-based practices that implement an organizational\nsecurity policy, does not establish a set threshold for an actor’s proficiency in identifying,\nassessing, and responding to security risks. If any actor believes it may lack the technical or\n180\nSee OCR, Guidance on Risk Analysis, https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/guidance-\nrisk-analysis/index.html?language=es.\n\n181\nONC and OCR have jointly launched the HHS HIPAA Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool,\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/security-risk-assessment-tool.\n\n\n\n\nother expertise necessary to conduct a risk assessment appropriate to its operations and the\nEHI for which it is responsible, we would encourage that actor to seek additional information,\ntraining, or support from an individual or entity with the required expertise. As finalized in §\n171.203(d)(2), the requirement that risks have been identified and assessed expressly provides\nfor this to have been done either by the actor or on the actor’s behalf. We are sensitive to the\npossibility that some actors, including but not limited to small clinician practices, may not be\nin a position to meet the condition finalized in paragraph (d) of § 171.203 immediately or for\nall of their security-based practices, and we therefore reiterate that we have finalized in §\n171.203(e) an alternative condition that an actor may choose to meet in circumstances where it\nmay not be practical for them to meet the condition finalized in § 171.203(d).\n\nWe also reiterate that, while we do encourage actors to voluntarily conform their\npractices to the conditions of an exception suited to the practice and its purpose, an actor’s\nchoice to do so simply provides them an enhanced level of assurance that the practices do not\nmeet the definition of information blocking. Failure to meet an exception does not necessarily\nmean a practice meets the definition of information blocking. If subject to an investigation by\nHHS, each practice that implicates the information blocking provision and that does not meet\nany exception would be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nParagraph (d)(3): Consensus-based standards or best practice guidance\nWe proposed (84 FR 7537) that the actor’s policy must align with one or more\napplicable consensus-based standards or best practice guidance. We noted that at present,\nexamples of relevant best practices for development of security policies include, but are not\nlimited to: NIST-800-53 Rev. 5; the NIST Cybersecurity Framework; and NIST SP 800-100,\nSP 800-37 Rev. 2, SP 800-39, as updated and as interpreted through formal guidance. We\nnoted that best practice guidance on security policies is also developed by consensus standards\n\n\n\n\nbodies such as ISO, IETF, or IEC. We stated that HIPAA covered entities and business\nassociates may be able to leverage their HIPAA Security Rule compliance activities and can,\nif they choose, align their security policy with those parts of the NIST Cybersecurity\nFramework that are referenced in the HIPAA Security Rule Crosswalk to NIST Cybersecurity\nFramework to satisfy this condition. We noted that relevant consensus-based standards and\nframeworks provide actors of varying sizes and resources with the flexibility needed to apply\nthe right security controls to the right information systems at the right time to adequately\naddress risk.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed a concern that a small independent clinician\npractice that conducts a risk analysis consistent with its obligation under the HIPAA Security\nRule may lack the technical expertise or other organizational capabilities needed to develop a\ncustomized security policy that appropriately applies consensus-based standards to each risk\nidentified. This commenter recommended that we incorporate in § 171.203(d) regulation text a\nstatement that these conditions apply “subject to the actor’s sophistication and technical\ncapabilities.”\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the point highlighted by the commenter that, even within a\ngiven type of actor, specific individuals or organizations may have different operational\ncontexts that include variations in their technical capabilities, expertise, and other resources.\n\nWe do not, however, believe it is necessary to revise the regulation text as recommended in\norder to allow for assessment of whether the actor’s practices, such as its organizational\nsecurity policy, were objectively reasonable in the circumstances in which they were\nimplemented.\n\n*Comments.* A number of commenters requested that this exception allow providers to\nbe proactive when promoting the security of EHI rather than taking a reactive stance.\n\n\n\n\nCommenters contended that for novel threats, consensus-based standards and best practice\nguidance may not exist, making it impossible for an actor to meet the condition that the\norganizational security policy align with such standards.\n\n*Response.* With cybersecurity risk continuously evolving and the large number of\nthreat sources active in the modern cybersecurity landscape, we recognize that actors must\ncontinuously monitor, assess, and respond to security risks that can themselves represent an\nimpediment to EHI access, exchange, and use. Thus, this exception allows actors flexibility in\nselecting and tailoring their practices to mitigate specific security risks, provided each such\npractice otherwise meets the conditions of this exception, notably including that it be directly\nrelated and tailored to the specific security risk being addressed and be implemented in a\nconsistent and non-discriminatory manner. We also note that best security practices in security\nmitigation can take a proactive as well as a reactive approach. A documented policy that\nprovides explicit references to consensus-based standards and best practice guidance (such as\nthe NIST Cybersecurity Framework) offers an objective and robust means by which we can\nevaluate the reasonableness of a particular security control for the purpose of the exception.\n\nWe also recognize that, as a practical matter, some actors (such as small health care providers\nor those with limited resources) may have organizational security policies that are less robust\nor that otherwise fall short of the minimum conditions proposed. In such circumstances an\nactor can still benefit from this exception by demonstrating that the practice met the conditions\nof this exception for circumstances where no formal (organizational) security policy was\nimplemented (see our discussion under “conditions applicable to practices that do not\nimplement an organizational security policy” header, below within this section of this final\nrule preamble).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter noted that it could be a difficult for an actor to meet the\n\n\n\n\nstandard to that the actor’s organizational policy on security must align with one or more\nconsensus-based standards or best practice guidance because there are many emerging\nsecurity threats that occur that are new and unexpected.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe that it would be difficult for an actor’s organizational\npolicy on security to align with one or more consensus-based standards or best practice\nguidance documents. An actor’s written security policies should be based on consensus-based\nstandards or best practice guidance documents which specifically address security risks and\nthreats. A security policy should be clearly written and observed and refers to clear,\ncomprehensive, and well-defined plans, rules, and practices that regulate access to an actor's\ninformation systems and the EHI included in it. We believe a good policy serves as a\nprominent statement to the outside world about the actor’s commitment to security, and that\nsuch a policy should be based on objective consensus-based standards and should not be ad\nhoc or arbitrary.\n\nWe do agree that there are emerging and novel security threats that occur, and in those\nsituations which are not specifically addressed by an actor’s security policies, we included in\nthe exception as proposed an alternative condition (proposed in § 171.203(e)) to address those\nsituations in which those security risks can be addressed based on particularized facts and\ncircumstances.\n\nWithin the condition (§ 171.203(d)) applicable to practices that implement an\norganizational security policy, the actor’s policy must align with one or more applicable\nconsensus-based standards or best practice guidance. The finalized condition is codified in §\n171.203(d)(3).\n\nParagraph (d)(4): Objective timeframes and other parameters\nWe proposed that the actor’s security policy must provide objective timeframes and\n\n\n\n\ncommon terminology used for identifying, responding to, and addressing security incidents.\n\nWe noted examples of acceptable sources for development of a security response plan include:\nNIST Incident Response Procedure (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-\n2/final), US-CERT for interactions with government systems (https://www.us-\ncert.gov/government-users/reporting-requirements), and ISC-CERT for critical infrastructure\n(https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/) (84 FR 7537).\n\nAs a point of clarification, we noted that an actor’s compliance with the HIPAA\nSecurity Rule (if applicable to the actor) would be relevant to, but not dispositive of, whether\nthe actor’s policies and procedures were objectively reasonable for the purpose of the\nexception. We explained that an actor’s documentation of its security policies and procedures\nfor compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule may not offer a sufficient basis to evaluate\nwhether the actor’s security practices unnecessarily interfere with access, exchange, or use of\nEHI. We further noted that a documented policy that provides explicit references to\nconsensus-based standards and best practice guidance (such as the NIST Cybersecurity\nFramework) would offer an objective and robust means by which to evaluate the\nreasonableness of a particular security control for the purpose of the exception (84 FR 7537).\n\n*Comments.* We received no comments opposing this requirement of the condition\napplicable to practices that implement an organizational security policy.\n\n*Response.* Within the condition (§ 171.203(d)) applicable to practices that implement\nan organizational security policy, we have finalized in § 171.203(d)(4) the condition that the\nactor’s organizational security policy “provide objective timeframes and other parameters for\nidentifying, responding to, and addressing security incidents.” We have finalized this\ncondition as proposed.\n\nCondition applicable to practices that do not implement an organizational security\n\n\n\n\npolicy\nIn the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7537), we recognized that, as a practical matter, some\nactors (such as small health care providers or those with limited resources) may have\norganizational security policies that are less robust or that otherwise fall short of the minimum\nconditions proposed. We proposed that in these circumstances an actor could still benefit from\nthe exception by demonstrating that the practice at issue was objectively reasonable under the\ncircumstances, without regard to a formal policy. While we noted in the Proposed Rule (84 FR\n7537) that we expect that most security practices engaged in by an actor will implement an\norganizational policy, we recognized that EHI security may present novel and unexpected\nthreats that even a best-practice risk assessment and security policy cannot anticipate. We\nnoted that if a practice that does not implement an organizational policy is to qualify for this\nexception, however, it must meet certain conditions. We stated that the actor’s practice must,\nbased on the particularized facts and circumstances, be necessary to mitigate the security risk.\n\nImportantly, we proposed that the actor would have to demonstrate that it considered\nreasonable and appropriate alternatives that could have reduced the likelihood of interference\nwith access, exchange, or use of EHI and that there were no reasonable and appropriate\nalternatives that were less likely to interfere with access, exchange or use of EHI.\n\nWe noted (84 FR 7538) that an actor’s consideration of reasonable and appropriate\nalternatives will depend on the urgency and nature of the security threat in question. We\nfurther noted that we anticipate that an actor’s qualification for the exception would\naccommodate exigent circumstances. For example, we stated that we would not expect an\nactor to delay the implementation of a security practice in response to an emergency on the\nbasis that it has not yet been able to initiate a fully realized risk assessment process. However,\nwe also stated that we would expect that in these exigent circumstances, where the actor has\n\n\n\n\nimplemented a security practice without first considering whether there were reasonable and\nappropriate alternatives that were less likely to interfere with access, exchange or use of EHI,\nthe actor would expeditiously make any necessary changes to the practice based on the actor’s\nre-consideration of reasonable and appropriate alternatives that are less likely to interfere with\naccess, exchange or use of EHI. We proposed that the exception would apply in these\ninstances so long as an actor takes these steps and complies with all other applicable\nconditions.\n\n*Comments.* Commenters stated that the absence of a policy means that one is dealing\nwith an unexpected and evolving situation as best one can (e.g., a sustained and sophisticated\nattack). Commenters suggested we create a further “safety valve” for short-lived actions that\nare taken in good faith while a situation is being evaluated and understood and that we should\nrecognize the valid need to allow for due diligence as distinct from simply delaying access and\nsuch due diligence should not need the Security Exception to avoid implicating or being\njudged as engaged in information blocking. Commenters stated this is a core need for small\nmedical practices with limited resources.\n\n*Response.* We anticipate that the exception’s conditions as proposed and finalized\nwould accommodate exigent circumstances. For example, we would not expect an actor to\ndelay the implementation of a security measure in response to an emergency such as a\ncyberattack simply because it has not yet been able to implement a fully realized risk\nassessment process. We believe the exception as posed does provide a “safety valve” for\nsituations where an actor in direct response to exigent circumstances may have implemented\nin good faith a security practice without first considering whether there were reasonable and\nappropriate alternatives that were less likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI,\nbut where the initial-response practice may be in place for only a short while. Presumably,\n\n\n\n\nsuch initial-response practices are in place for only a short time precisely because, upon more\nfully identifying and assessing current risks in context or as follow-up to the exigent\ncircumstances, the actor will have concluded it carried a greater than necessary burden—\nincluding the burden of interference with access, exchange or use of EHI—and consequently\nmodified or replaced its initial-response practice with a less onerous alternative that was\nreasonable and appropriately tailored to the specific risk addressed.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter agreed that this exception allows for an actor to maintain\nflexibility in its approach to address security incidents or threats.\n\n*Response.* We agree that this exception provides an actor the flexibility to address\nsecurity incidents or threats based on particularized facts and circumstances which are\nnecessary to mitigate the security risk to EHI, provided that there are no reasonable and\nappropriate alternatives to the practice that address the security risk that are less likely to\ninterfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange or use of EHI.\n\nWe have finalized as proposed, in § 171.203(e), the requirements applicable to\npractices that meet the threshold conditions established in §§ 171.203(a), (b) and (c) and that\ndo not implement an organizational security policy.\n\n\n",

We proposed that in certain circumstances legitimate practical challenges\nbeyond an actor’s control may limit its ability to comply with requests for access, exchange,\n\n\n\n\nor use of EHI. In some cases, the actor may not have—and may be unable to obtain—the\nrequisite technological capabilities, legal rights, financial resources, or other means necessary\nto provide a particular form of access, exchange, or use. In other cases, the actor may be able\nto comply with the request, but only by incurring costs or other burdens that are clearly\nunreasonable under the circumstances (84 FR 7542).\n\nWe proposed that the exception would permit an actor to decline a request in certain\nnarrowly-defined circumstances when doing so would be infeasible (or impossible) and when\nthe actor otherwise did all that it reasonably could do under the circumstances to facilitate\nalternative means of accessing, exchanging, and using the EHI. We proposed a structured,\nfact-based approach for determining whether a request was “infeasible” within the meaning of\nthe exception.

We note that we\nhave changed the title of this exception from “Exception—Responding to requests that are\ninfeasible” (84 FR 7603) to “When will an actor’s practice of not fulfilling a request to access,\nexchange, or use electronic health information due to the infeasibility of the request not be\nconsidered information blocking?” Throughout this final rule preamble, we use “Infeasibility\nException” as a short form of this title, for ease of reference.

                      "text": "To qualify for the exception, we proposed that compliance with the request for access,\nexchange, or use of EHI must be infeasible. We proposed a two-step test that an actor would\nneed to meet in order to demonstrate that a request was infeasible. Under the first step of the\ninfeasibility test, we proposed that the actor would need to show that complying with the\nparticular request in the manner requested would impose a substantial burden on the actor.\n\nSecond, we proposed that the actor must also demonstrate that requiring it to comply with the\nrequest—and thus to assume the substantial burden demonstrated under the first part of the\ntest—would have been plainly unreasonable under the circumstances (84 FR 7542 and 7543).\n\nWe proposed that whether it would have been plainly unreasonable for the actor to assume the\nburden of providing access, exchange, or use will be highly dependent on the particular facts\nand circumstances. We proposed to rely primarily on the following key factors enumerated in\nproposed § 171.205(a)(1):\n The type of EHI and the purposes for which it may be needed;\n The cost to the actor of complying with the request in the manner requested;\n The financial, technical, and other resources available to the actor;\n Whether the actor provides comparable access, exchange, or use to itself or to\nits customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a\n\n\n\n\nbusiness relationship;\n Whether the actor owns or has control over a predominant technology,\nplatform, health information exchange, or health information network through\nwhich EHI is accessed or exchanged;\n Whether the actor maintains ePHI on behalf of a covered entity, as defined in\n45 CFR 160.103, or maintains EHI on behalf of the requestor or another person\nwhose access, exchange, or use of EHI will be enabled or facilitated by the\nactor’s compliance with the request;\n Whether the requestor and other relevant persons can reasonably access,\nexchange, or use the information from other sources or through other means;\nand\n The additional cost and burden to the requestor and other relevant persons of\nrelying on alternative means of access, exchange, or use (84 FR 7543).\n\nWe acknowledged in the Proposed Rule that there may be situations when complying\nwith a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI would be considered infeasible because an\nactor is unable to provide such access, exchange, or use due to unforeseeable or unavoidable\ncircumstances that are outside the actor’s control. As examples, we stated that an actor could\nseek coverage under this exception if it is unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI\ndue to a natural disaster (such as a hurricane, tornado or earthquake) or war. We emphasized\nthat, consistent with the requirements for demonstrating that practices meet all the conditions\nof a proposed exception, the actor would need to produce evidence and ultimately prove that\ncomplying with the request for access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner requested would\nhave imposed a clearly unreasonable burden on the actor under the circumstances (84 FR 7543\n\n\n\n\nand 7544).\n\nWe stated that certain circumstances would not constitute a burden to the actor for\npurposes of this exception and would not be considered in determining whether complying\nwith a request would have been infeasible. We proposed that it would not be considered a\nburden if providing the requested access, exchange, or use of EHI in the manner requested\nwould have (1) facilitated competition with the actor; or (2) prevented the actor from charging\na fee (84 FR 7544).\n\nWe requested comment on the proposed approach for determining whether a request is\n“infeasible” within the meaning of the exception. We encouraged comment on, among other\nissues, whether the factors we specifically delineated properly focus the infeasibility inquiry;\nwhether our approach to weighing these factors is appropriate; and whether there are\nadditional burdens, distinct from the immediate and direct financial and operational\nchallenges, that are similarly concrete and should be considered under the fact-based rubric of\nthe exception (84 FR 7544).\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments in support of our proposed approach for\ndetermining whether a request was “infeasible.” We also received several comments that\nexpressed various concerns and suggestions for improvement regarding our proposals. Several\ncommenters expressed concern that the language in the proposed exception, particularly\nregarding the “infeasibility” of a request, was too vague or ambiguous and that the inclusion\nof undefined terms could create uncertainty for actors regarding whether they meet the\nconditions under the exception. Commenters noted that such uncertainty could dissuade actors\nfrom taking advantage of the exception. Commenters requested additional examples and\nguidance to clarify the conditions under the exception.\n\nA few commenters questioned whether it would be considered information blocking if\n\n\n\n\nthey could not segment EHI to respond to a request for a patient’s EHI (e.g., when patient\nconsent to share EHI subject to 42 CFR Part 2 or a State privacy law has not been provided).\n\nThese commenters expressed concern about the ability of their technology to segment a\npatient’s EHI.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of our proposed approach for\ndetermining whether a request is “infeasible,” as well as the constructive feedback. We agree\nwith commenters that each exception should clearly explain the conduct that would and would\nnot be covered by each exception. We also reiterate that failure to meet the exception does not\nmean that an actor’s practice related to infeasible requests necessarily meets the information\nblocking definition. However, as we noted in the Proposed Rule, the broad definition of\ninformation blocking in the Cures Act means that any practice that is likely to interfere with\nthe access, exchange, or use of EHI implicates the information blocking provision. As a result,\npractices that do not meet the exception will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to\ndetermine, for example, the actor’s intent and whether the practice rises to the level of an\ninterference.\n\nWe have restructured this exception to provide further clarity. Toward that end, we\nhave eliminated the proposed two-step test that an actor would need to meet in order to\ndemonstrate that a request is infeasible (84 FR 7542 and 7543). Instead, we have finalized a\nrevised framework for this exception that provides two new conditions that must be met in\norder for an actor to be covered by the exception and a revised condition that provides an\nexception for those actors unable to meet the new Content and Manner Exception. When the\npractice by an actor meets one of the conditions in § 171.204(a) and the actor meets the\nrequirements for responding to requests in § 171.204(b) (which are discussed in more detail\nbelow), the actor is not required to fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI due to\n\n\n\n\nthe infeasibility of the request.\n\nThe first new condition is that the actor cannot fulfill the request for access, exchange,\nor use of EHI due to events beyond the actor’s control, namely a natural or human-made\ndisaster, public health emergency, public safety incident, war, terrorist attack, civil\ninsurrection, strike or other labor unrest, telecommunication or internet service interruption, or\nact of military, civil or regulatory authority (§ 171.204(a)(1)). This is consistent with our\nstatements in the Proposed Rule describing events that an actor could seek coverage for under\nthis exception if it is was unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI due to events\nbeyond its control (84 FR 7543). This new condition makes clear that such events are all that\nare necessary to meet this exception and no consideration of factors must be demonstrated and\nproven.\n\nThe second new condition is that the actor is not required to fulfill a request for access,\nexchange, or use of EHI if the actor cannot unambiguously segment the requested EHI from\nother EHI: (1) because of a patient’s preference or because the EHI cannot be made available\nby law; or (2) because the EHI is withheld in accordance with the Harm Exception in §\n171.201 (§ 171.204(a)(2)). For instance, an actor will be covered under this condition if the\nactor could not fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use EHI because the requested EHI\ncould not be unambiguously segmented from patient records created by federally assisted\nprograms (i.e., Part 2 Programs) for the treatment of substance use disorder (and covered by\n42 CFR part 2) or from records that the patient has expressed a preference not to disclose.\n\nThe revised condition in § 171.204(a)(3)(i) specifically aligns with our proposal (84\nFR 7543) in that an actor would not be required to fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use\nof EHI if the actor demonstrates, through contemporaneous written record or other\ndocumentation, its consideration of the following factors in a consistent and non-\n\n\n\n\ndiscriminatory manner, prior to responding to the request pursuant to paragraph (b) of this\nsection, that led to its determination that complying with the request would be infeasible under\nthe circumstances:\n The type of EHI and the purposes for which it may be needed;\n The cost to the actor of complying with the request in the manner requested;\n The financial and technical resources available to the actor;\n Whether the actor’s practice is non-discriminatory and the actor provides the same\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI to its companies or to its customers, suppliers,\npartners, and other persons with whom it has a business relationship;\n Whether the actor owns or has control over a predominant technology, platform,\nhealth information exchange, or health information network through which electronic\nhealth information is accessed or exchanged; and\n Why the actor was unable to provide access, exchange, or use of EHI consistent with\nthe Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301.\n\nWe note that the above provisions align with our proposal in the Proposed Rule that\nthe actor must provide the requestor with a detailed written explanation of the reasons why the\nactor cannot accommodate the request (84 FR 7544). The difference in the final language is\nthat we have not specified the level of detail required in the written record or other\ndocumentation, and have clarified that such a written record or other documentation must be\ncontemporaneous so that an actor cannot use a post hoc rationalization for claiming the\nrequest was infeasible under circumstances that were not considered at the time the request\nwas received.\n\nWe proposed in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7544) and have finalized in this final rule in\n\n\n\n\n§ 171.204(a)(3)(ii) the following factors that may not be considered in the determination: (1)\nwhether the manner requested would have facilitated competition with the actor; and (2)\nwhether the manner requested prevented the actor from charging a fee or resulted in a reduced\nfee. We note that we have clarified in the final rule that charging “a” fee includes a reduced\nfee as well. Our rationale for carving out these considerations is that the purpose of the\nInfeasibility Exception is to provide coverage to actors who face legitimate practical\nchallenges beyond their control that limit their ability to comply with requests to access,\nexchange, or use EHI. We do not believe that whether the manner requested would have\nfacilitated competition with the actor or prevented the actor from charging a fee or resulted in\na reduced fee qualify as the type of legitimate practical challenges beyond the actor’s control\nthat should be covered by the exception. Regarding the consideration of fees, the actor is able\nto charge fees for costs reasonably incurred, with a reasonable profit margin, for accessing,\nexchanging, or using EHI under the Fees Exception in § 171.302.\n\nWe have finalized in § 171.204(a)(3)(i)(F) the criterion that considers an actor’s ability\nto provide access, exchange, and use of EHI consistent with the Content and Manner\nException in § 171.301 in order to assure alignment of this exception with the Content and\nManner Exception. We further discuss the Content and Manner Exception in section\nVIII.D.2.a of this final rule.\n\nWe did not finalize three factors that were proposed in the context of the infeasibility\nanalysis: (1) whether the actor maintains electronic protected health information on behalf of a\ncovered entity, as defined in 45 CFR 160.103, or maintains electronic health information on\nbehalf of the requestor or another person whose access, exchange, or use of electronic health\ninformation will be enabled or facilitated by the actor’s compliance with the request; (2)\nwhether the requestor and other relevant persons can reasonably access, exchange, or use the\n\n\n\n\nelectronic health information from other sources or through other means; and (3) the\nadditional cost and burden to the requestor and other relevant persons of relying on alternative\nmeans of access, exchange, or use (see the proposed factors at 84 FR 7543). We removed the\nfirst factor because it was confusing and was not a strong indicator of whether a request was\ninfeasible. We removed the second and third factors because we proposed them with the\nintention that they would be indicators of whether the relative burden on the requestor was\ngreater than that on the actor. However, we have shifted away from this relative burden\nanalysis in the final rule. To illustrate, consideration does not have to be given as to whether\nother means are available for access, exchange, or use of EHI or the cost to the requestor for\nthat alternative means because of the new Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301) and its\nrelationship to this exception.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter recommended that claims of infeasibility based on the\nclassification of EHI as proprietary and claims of infeasibility rooted in discriminatory\npractices should not be included in the exception, as they do not support ONC’s policy goals\nof promoting competition and innovation in health IT and ultimately disadvantage customers\nand patients.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenter that claiming the EHI itself as proprietary is\nnot a justification for claiming this exception. As discussed in more detail in the Fees\nException, we emphasize that almost all of the patient EHI found in the U.S. health care\nsystem has been generated and paid for with either public dollars through Federal programs,\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid, or directly subsidized through the tax preferences for\nemployer-based insurance.\n\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule how use of IP rights for interoperability elements\ncan serve to interfere with access, exchange, and use of EHI. We also explained in the\n\n\n\n\nProposed Rule that the mere fact that EHI is stored in a proprietary format or has been\ncombined with confidential or proprietary information does not alter the actor’s obligations\nunder the information blocking provision to facilitate access, exchange, and use of the EHI in\nresponse to a request (84 FR 7517). We emphasize that actors who control proprietary\ninteroperability elements and demand royalties or license terms from competitors or other\npersons who are technologically dependent on the use of those interoperability elements\nwould also be subject to the information blocking provision, unless they meet all conditions of\nthe Licensing Exception (§ 171.303).\n\nWe note, however, that actors may seek coverage under the Infeasibility Exception (§\n171.204) or Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301) for certain issues related to IP. For\ninstance, an actor may claim to be unable to fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use EHI\nbecause the actor is not the owner of the IP rights and lacks requisite authority to provide the\nrequested access, exchange, or use of EHI. In such a situation, the actor could claim that the\nrequest is infeasible under the circumstances (see § 171.204(a)(3)). Under §\n171.204(a)(3)(i)(E), one factor that can be considered when determining whether a practice is\ninfeasible under the circumstances is whether the actor owns or has control over a\npredominant technology, platform, HIE, or HIN through which EHI is accessed or exchanged.\n\nThe actor could also seek coverage under the Content and Manner Exception. Under §\n171.301(b)(2), an actor may provide the EHI requested in an alternative manner if responding\nto the request in the manner requested would require the actor to license IP. As we have\nexplained throughout this final rule, each information blocking case, and whether the actor’s\npractice would meet all conditions of an exception, will depend on its own unique facts and\ncircumstances. We refer readers to the detailed discussions regarding the Content and Manner\nException (VIII.D.2.a) and Licensing Exception (VIII.D.2.c) in this preamble.\n\n\n\n\nWe also agree with the commenter that infeasibility rooted in discriminatory practices\nshould not be a justification for claiming this exception. It was never our intention to allow\nsuch conduct to be covered by this exception. In response to this comment, we have clarified\nthe factor in § 171.204(a)(3)(i)(D) to explicitly state that one consideration for determining\nwhether a request is infeasible under the circumstances is whether the actor’s practice is non-\ndiscriminatory and the actor provides the same access, exchange, or use to its companies or to\nits customers, suppliers, partners, and other persons with whom it has a business relationship.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern that this exception does not fully\nconsider potential conflicts between valid contracts, such as business associate agreements\n(BAAs), and subsequent requests for access, exchange, and use of EHI that are inconsistent\nwith those contracts. Commenters urged ONC to specify whether an actor can refuse a request\nto access, exchange, or use EHI as being infeasible due to such contractual restrictions and\nobligations.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. We reiterate, as we explained in the\nProposed Rule, that one means by which actors restrict access, exchange, or use of EHI is\nthrough formal restrictions, such as contract or license terms, EHI sharing policies,\norganizational policies or procedures, or other instruments or documents that set forth\nrequirements related to EHI or health IT (84 FR 7518). We emphasize that such restrictions\nare one of the forms of information blocking the Cures Act and our final rule seek to address.\n\nWe refer readers to the discussion of “Practices that May Implicate the Information Blocking\nProvision” in section VIII.C.6 of this final rule for a more detailed discussion of when\ncontracts and agreements will be considered an “interference” with access, exchange, or use of\nEHI.\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters encouraged ONC to add a provision to the exception\n\n\n\n\nthat would enable entities who have joined Trusted Exchange Framework and Common\nAgreement (TEFCA) to claim the Infeasibility Exception if a requestor or third party refused\nto join the TEFCA and instead demanded a one-off interface.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments, but have decided not to adopt this suggested\naddition at this time. The TEFCA is still new, the Common Agreement is not yet finalized,\nand it would be premature to establish special treatment for entities that join the TEFCA. We\nmay reconsider this suggestion at a later date. We note that this does not necessarily mean that\nactors in these situations will not be covered by the exception, as they could still show that a\nrequest for a one-off interface is infeasible under the circumstances (see § 171.204(a)(3)).\n\nHowever, not joining TEFCA is not de facto proof of infeasibility. We note that in addition to\nseeking coverage for infeasibility under the circumstances, the actor could also seek coverage\nfrom: (1) the Content and Manner Exception if the actor could not fulfill request to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in the manner requested (via a one-off interface), but could fulfill the\nrequest through an acceptable alternative manner (see § 171.301(b)); or (2) the Fees Exception\nor Licensing Exception if the actor chooses to provide the one-off interface as requested, but\ncharges fees/royalties related to developing or licensing the one-off interface, which could\ninclude fees or royalties that result in a reasonable profit margin (see § 171.302 and 303).\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed, in addition to demonstrating that a particular request was infeasible, that\nan actor would have to show that it satisfied additional conditions. Specifically, we proposed\nthat to qualify for the exception, the actor must have timely responded to all requests relating\nto access, exchange, and use of EHI. Further, we proposed that for any request that the actor\nclaims was infeasible, the actor must have provided the requestor with a detailed written\nexplanation of the reasons why the actor could not accommodate the request. We proposed\n\n\n\n\nthat the actor’s failure to meet any of these conditions would disqualify the actor from the\nexception and could also be evidence that the actor knew that it was engaging in practices that\ncontravened the information blocking provision (84 FR 7544).\n\nWe proposed that the duty to timely respond and provide reasonable cooperation\nwould necessarily be assessed from the standpoint of what is objectively reasonable for an\nindividual or entity in the actor’s position. We emphasized that we will look at the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each case to determine whether the practice is objectively\nreasonable (84 FR 7544).\n\nWe encouraged comment on these conditions and related considerations. Specifically,\nwe requested comment regarding potential obstacles to satisfying these conditions and\nimprovements we could make to the proposed process (84 FR 7544).\n\n*Comments.* Many commenters, primarily provider organizations, expressed concern\nthat the proposed response requirements could create burden on providers, hospitals, and\nclinical data registries. Commenters explained that each time a requester makes a request that\nan actor deems infeasible, the actor would be required to timely respond and provide a\ndetailed written explanation of its reasons for denial. A commenter also recommended that, in\nthe event a request is infeasible and a written explanation is necessary, that such explanation\nneed not contain detailed technical information.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and have revised the response condition in\nthis exception to address commenters’ concerns and establish a set timeframe for responding\nto requests (§ 171.204(b)). We removed the use of the term “timely” and restructured the\nprovision to more clearly explain ONC’s expectations for responding to requests. Under the\nresponse condition, if an actor does not fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI for\nany of the reasons in § 171.204(a), the actor must, within ten business days of receipt of the\n\n\n\n\nrequest, provide to the requestor in writing the reason why meeting the request was infeasible.\n\nOur decision to finalize a 10-business day response timeframe was informed by our\nknowledge of the industry, stakeholder commenters, and a desire to create consistent\ntimeframes across exceptions, such as alignment with the 10-business day response timeframe\nin the Licensing Exception (see § 171.303(a)(1)).\n\nIn instances when an actor is unable to respond within 10 business days, the actor may be\nunable to avail themselves of the requirements of the exception. As part of an information\nblocking investigation, ONC and OIG may consider documentation or other writings maintained\nby the actor around the time of the request that provide evidence of the actor’s intent. Additional\ndocumentation would not permit the actor to avail themselves of this exception, but ONC or OIG\ncould examine the actor’s intent using this documentation when assessing the information\nblocking claim.\n\nWe have decided not to specify the level of detail or specific type of information (such\nas technical information) that must be contained in a written response. We believe it would be\nimprudent to create such boundaries for the written response given that the facts and\ncircumstances will vary significantly from case to case. Instead, the finalized provision allows\nactors to determine what content is necessary to include in the written response in order to\nexplain the reason the request is infeasible. We note that we have revised the requirement for\nthe written response from the Proposed Rule. In the Proposed Rule an actor was required to\nprovide a “detailed written explanation of the reasons why the actor cannot accommodate the\nrequest” (84 FR 7544) whereas we have finalized the requirement that the actor must provide\n“in writing the reason(s) why the request is infeasible” (§ 171.204(b)). We believe this revised\nrequirement will alleviate burden on actors by providing them discretion to decide the\nappropriate level of detail to include in their written responses. It also places a greater\n\n\n\n\nemphasis on establishing that the request was infeasible to meet.\n\nReasonable Alternative\nWe proposed that, if the actor could not meet the request for EHI, the actor must work\nwith the requesting party in a timely manner to identify and provide a reasonable alternative\nmeans of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI, as applicable (84 FR 7544).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters, primarily provider organizations, were supportive of the\nproposed requirement to provide a reasonable alternative. We also received a range of\ncomments related to improving ONC’s proposals regarding the provision of a reasonable\nalternative, including comments requesting more examples and guidance as to what would be\nconsidered a “reasonable alternative.” Another commenter requested that ONC provide\ngreater deference to the actor to determine the appropriate format/functionality for sharing the\nrequested EHI when a comparable functionality, distinct from the format/functionality\nrequested, is made available and enables access, exchange, or use of EHI on equivalent terms.\n\nOne commenter requested ONC place guardrails around requests for information sharing, such\nthat if an actor is able to share data in an industry-accepted format, the requesting organization\ncannot make an information blocking claim if that format does not meet their preferred,\nspecific data transmission standard.\n\nA few commenters requested that ONC remove the requirement that an actor both\n“identify” and “provide” a reasonable alternative means of accessing EHI, and instead require\nonly that an actor “identify” a reasonable alternative. One commenter requested that ONC\nclarify that the proposed requirement to identify a reasonable alternative means of accessing,\nexchanging, or using EHI is only necessary where any such alternative exists. The commenter\nnoted that there could be instances in which no reasonable alternative exists, and the request is\nin effect impossible to comply with. One commenter requested that ONC clarify that,\n\n\n\n\nregarding the provision of a reasonable alternative, an actor must only work with the requestor\nin a timely manner to identify and provide a reasonable alternative means of accessing,\nexchanging, or using the EHI as applicable. One commenter expressed concern that this\nexception could be used to send patients to other sources to get their health information\nbecause that approach would be less burdensome than providing the information to the patient\ndirectly. The commenter recommended that ONC preclude the use of this exception for patient\naccess requests.\n\nSome provider, hospital, and clinical data registry commenters expressed concern\nregarding the potential burden on the actor related to identifying and providing a reasonable\nalternative means of accessing, exchanging or using the EHI. Other commenters, primarily\nhealth IT developers, expressed concern regarding the potential impact and burden on health\nIT developers, HINs, and HIEs of complying with a request to access, exchange, or use EHI,\nespecially when the request requires custom development. Commenters explained that if a\nsystem, even a large system, were required to comply with many custom forms of integration,\ncollectively they would cause a significant burden to both business and budget. Some\ncommenters also noted that the proposed exception seems imbalanced, favoring the requester\nof the EHI over the actor providing the EHI.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the support for our proposal, as well as the array of\nconstructive comments. We first note that, in many instances, the exceptions, including the\nfinalized third condition of this exception (§ 171.204(a)(3)), favor the request for EHI because\nthe overall information blocking paradigm is to eliminate interference with access, exchange,\nand use of EHI. We have removed the “reasonable alternative” requirement from this\nexception and instead have finalized the new Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301 that\nestablishes the content (i.e., the EHI) required in the response and the manner in which the\n\n\n\n\nactor may respond to the request for access, exchange, or use of EHI. This new exception\nimproves on the “reasonable alternative” requirement in the Proposed Rule by clarifying\nactors’ obligations for providing access, exchange, or use of EHI in all situations and creating\nactionable technical procedures.\n\nWe believe the Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301 is responsive to the above\ncomments, will reduce burden on actors, and is principled and tailored in a manner that will\npromote basic fairness and encourage parties to work cooperatively to implement efficient\nsolutions to interoperability challenges. We refer readers to the Content and Manner\nException and the discussion of such exception in this preamble in sections VIII.C and\nVIII.D.2.a. With regard to the comment suggesting that no reasonable alternative may exist,\nwe believe that the new exception will address this concern. However, if the actor still could\nnot meet the new exception, the actor could avail itself of the third condition in this exception\nand demonstrate that the request was infeasible under the circumstances.\n\n\n",

We stated in the\nProposed Rule that this exception would apply to the unavailability of health IT occasioned by\nboth planned and unplanned maintenance and improvement. We noted that planned\nmaintenance or improvements are often carried out at regular intervals and address routine\nrepairs, updates, or new releases while unplanned maintenance or improvements typically\n\n\n\n\nrespond to urgent or time-sensitive issues. We proposed to codify the exception’s regulation\ntext in § 171.207 (84 FR 7605).\n\nTo ensure that the actor’s practice of making health IT, and in turn EHI, unavailable\nfor the purpose of carrying out maintenance or improvements is reasonable and necessary, we\nproposed conditions that would need to be satisfied at all relevant times a practice to be\nrecognized as excepted from the definition of information blocking under this proposed\nexception.\n\n*Comments.* We received numerous comments supporting the establishment of this\nexception. We did not receive comments opposing the establishment of this exception. Many\nof the comments received requested clarification or recommended revisions to specific points\nwithin the proposed exception. The comments requesting clarification or making\nrecommendations are summarized below.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. We have established the proposed exception\nwith modifications from the regulation text proposed in the Proposed Rule. We have retitled\nthe exception from “Exception—Maintaining and improving health IT performance”\n\n(proposed § 171.207, at 84 FR 7605) to “Health IT Performance Exception — When will a\npractice that is implemented to maintain or improve health IT performance and that is likely to\ninterfere with the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information not be considered\ninformation blocking?” (§ 171.205 as finalized). For ease of reference and discussion, we use\n“Health IT Performance Exception” as a short title for the finalized exception throughout this\npreamble. Unless we are directly quoting the Proposed Rule or accurate re-statement of\nProposed Rule content requires otherwise, we use “Health IT Performance Exception” in this\nsection of this preamble when discussing this exception as proposed as well as the finalized\nexception. As stated in section VIII.D of this preamble (under the heading “modifications”),\n\n\n\n\nwe changed the titles of all of the information blocking exceptions to questions for additional\nclarity. We revised the wording of the finalized § 171.205 introductory text in comparison\nwith that proposed in § 171.207 so that it is consistent with the finalized title of the exception\n(and § 171.205). Consistent with the restructuring of part 171 that is also described in section\nVIII.D of this preamble (under the heading “modifications”), this exception has been\nredesignated from § 171.207 in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7605) to § 171.205 as finalized.\n\nCommenters’ requests for clarification and suggested revisions on specific points are\ndiscussed below. Other revisions we have made to the regulation text finalized in § 171.205 in\ncomparison to that proposed in § 171.207 are also discussed below.\n\nUnavailability of health IT must be for no longer than necessary to achieve the\nmaintenance or improvements for which the health IT was made unavailable\nWe proposed that any unavailability of health IT must be for a period of time no\nlonger than necessary to achieve the maintenance or improvement purpose for which the\nhealth IT is made unavailable or its performance degraded (84 FR 7550 and 7551). We\nprovided as an illustrative example that a health IT developer of certified health IT that has the\nright under its contract with a large health system to take its system offline for four hours each\nmonth to conduct routine maintenance would not qualify for this exception if an information\nblocking claim was made about a period of unavailability during which no maintenance was\nperformed.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments from a variety of stakeholders on the proposed\nrequirement that any unavailability of health IT would need to be for a period of time no\nlonger than necessary to achieve the maintenance or improvements for which the health IT\nwas made unavailable. Some commenters agreed that temporary unavailability of health IT\n“for a period of time no longer than necessary” created an appropriate standard for both\n\n\n\n\nplanned and unplanned downtimes. Other commenters indicated they did not support this\nstandard, stating concerns that the requirement that the health IT be made unavailable “for a\nperiod of time no longer than necessary” would be too difficult to assess without more specific\ncriteria such as defined time periods. Some commenters suggested we modify our language to\nallow for greater flexibility in maintenance downtime situations.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized within the condition for maintenance and improvements\nto health IT in § 171.205(a)(1) the requirement proposed in § 171.201(a)(1), with\nmodifications to the regulation text that are described below (immediately preceding the\npreamble discussion of the next subparagraph of § 171.205(a)).When an actor choosing to\nconform its practice to the health IT performance exception implements a practice that makes\nhealth IT under that actor’s control temporarily unavailable, or temporarily degrades the\nperformance of health IT, in order to perform maintenance or improvements to the health IT,\nthe actor’s practice must be (§ 171.205(a)(1)) implemented for a period of time no longer than\nnecessary to complete the maintenance or improvements for which the health IT was made\nunavailable or the health IT’s performance degraded. We believe that establishing specific\ntimeframes applicable to various maintenance and improvement purposes would be\nimpractical at this time due to the wide variety of system architectures and operational\ncontexts in which health IT to which part 171 is applicable is currently, or may in the future\nbe, deployed. We have finalized the “no longer than necessary” requirement of this condition,\nwhich we believe provides substantial flexibility to consider the particular circumstances of\neach case, and a variety of factors including but not limited to the service level agreements in\nplace for the specific health IT at issue, the type of maintenance or improvements, the\ntechnical resources available to the actor, or best practices or other industry benchmarks\nrelevant to the particular maintenance or improvements.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Noting our use of the phrase “as soon as possible” in the Proposed Rule’s\npreamble discussion of this condition (84 FR 7551), specifically in an example where an actor\ntakes health IT offline in response to a software failure, some commenters requested we\nclarify how we interpret that phrase. A commenter described practices such as procedures that\nphased restoration of full functionality across a complex system, to manage system loads or\nconfirm the original failure is fully resolved, and asked if we would interpret this exception’s\nproposed conditions as excluding such procedures. Some comments from members of the\ndeveloper community suggested that we modify our proposed language from “for a period of\ntime no longer than necessary” to “a reasonable period of time.”\n\n*Response.* The “no longer than necessary” standard provides actors substantial\nflexibility to address the particular circumstances of each case, allowing for consideration of a\nvariety of factors including but not limited to the service level agreements in place for the\nspecific health IT at issue, the type of maintenance or improvements, the technical resources\navailable to the actor, or best practices or other industry benchmarks relevant to the particular\nmaintenance or improvements. In response to comments requesting we clarify how we\ninterpret “as soon as possible” and how it would apply to specific types of practices, we first\nask readers to note that in this final rule preamble for the Health IT Performance Exception we\nuse the phrase “as soon as possible” only in summarizing and responding to these comments.\n\nWe see how this phrase could be read as implying that we might uniformly expect restarts in a\nshorter time or more abrupt manner than might be consistent with best practices for ensuring\nthe affected component(s) or production environment are restored to stable, reliable operating\nstatus. We do not, however, interpret the finalized condition as uniformly mandating\nimmediate full restarts of any or every system. In determining whether an actor’s practice\nmade health IT under its control unavailable, or degraded the health IT’s performance, for\n\n\n\n\nlonger than was necessary in the particular circumstances, we would consider a variety of\nfactors such as (but not limited to) the service level agreements in place for the specific health\nIT at issue, the type of maintenance or improvements, the technical resources available to the\nactor, or best practices or other industry benchmarks relevant to the particular maintenance or\nimprovements.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters recommended that this exception apply to downtime\nnecessary for testing whether a maintenance or improvement activity, such as deploying a new\nor updated application into a particular production environment for the first time, will operate\nin that environment as it is intended to operate or without adversely affecting other functions\nof the system.\n\n*Response.* We interpret “minimum time necessary” to complete a maintenance or\nimprovement purpose, objective, or activity to include reasonable and necessary practices,\nsuch as confirmatory testing and phased restart protocols, to ensure that a newly deployed or\nnewly updated application functions in a particular production environment as it is intended to\nperform and does not adversely affect system stability or the performance of critical functions\nor components of that system. In determining whether an actor’s practice affected health IT’s\navailability or performance for longer than was necessary in the particular circumstances, we\nreiterate that we would consider a variety of factors such as (but not limited to) the service\nlevel agreements in place for the specific health IT at issue, the type of maintenance or\nimprovements, the technical resources available to the actor, or best practices or other industry\nbenchmarks relevant to the particular maintenance or improvements.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters recommended that we recognize there may be\ncircumstances where an instance of downtime may exceed service level agreements but still\nbe no longer than necessary to address the issue. These commenters suggested such violations\n\n\n\n\nof service level agreements and other provisions of contracts between the parties should\nremain to be resolved through contractual mechanisms and not automatically considered\ninformation blocking on basis of exceeding the terms of the agreements. One commenter\nsuggested actors who make their health IT temporarily unavailable under this exception be\nheld to industry standards for necessary timeframes to complete any maintenance or\nimprovements.\n\n*Response.* For purposes of determining whether a period of health IT unavailability or\nperformance degradation is (or was) no longer than necessary to accomplish its purpose, we\nnote that service level agreements and industry practices would be relevant information to be\nconsidered but not necessarily dispositive. For example, a period of health IT unavailability or\nperformance degradation could be within the parameters of applicable service level\nagreements but still be longer than necessary to accomplish the maintenance or improvement\npurpose for the health IT was made unavailable or its performance degraded. For a contrasting\nexample, a period of health IT unavailability or performance degradation could be outside the\nparameters of applicable service level agreements—a contractual matter for the parties to\nresolve through other appropriate channels—without being “longer than necessary” in the\ntotality of applicable circumstances and, therefore, without necessarily constituting\ninformation blocking as defined in § 171.103.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested we clarify whether this exception would\napply to practices that degrade some aspects of a health IT system’s performance, without\nmaking it entirely unavailable, for purposes of conducting maintenance and improvement of\nthe health IT system or some of its components.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the feedback. We agree that there may be circumstances\nwhere the minimum disruption of an overall health IT system’s availability needed to\n\n\n\n\naccomplish particular maintenance or improvement purposes may be less than total. We do\nnot intend that this exception would apply only to complete unavailability of health IT. We\nintend the exception to apply to reasonable and necessary practices that disrupt EHI access,\nexchange, or use not only for the shortest time but also to the least extent practicable to\naccomplish their specific maintenance or improvement purposes under the particular\ncircumstances. Accordingly, we have modified the language of § 171.205(a)(1) as finalized to\nexpressly include temporary performance degradation as well as temporary unavailability of\nhealth IT affected by maintenance and improvement practices.\n\nDiscussion of finalized text of § 171.205(a)(1)\nThe regulation text finalized in § 171.205(a)(1) has been modified in comparison to\nthe regulation text proposed in § 171.207(a)(1) in several ways. The finalized regulation text\nexpressly includes “or the health IT’s performance degraded,” for the reasons stated in\nresponse to comments (above). In the text of this provision, finalized at § 171.205(a)(1), we\nhave also replaced the verb “to achieve” with the verb “to complete.” Reflecting on the\ncomments received, we have reviewed the dictionary definition of “achieve” and now believe\nthat our use of “achieve” in the regulation text proposed in in § 171.207(a)(1) may have\ncontributed to commenters’ concerns about whether we would interpret time for confirmatory\ntesting of system performance or phased restart protocols as falling within the “minimum time\nnecessary” for any particular maintenance or upgrade.\n\nWe believe “complete” less ambiguously expresses our intent that this requirement of\nthis condition encompasses the minimum time necessary, in the totality of the particular\ncircumstances, to fully complete the maintenance or improvement activity, including any\nconfirmatory testing or other protocols necessary to ensure an orderly and reliable restoration\nof normal operating status. We have also revised the wording of § 171.205(a) as finalized so\n\n\n\n\nthat it is consistent with the title and introductory text of § 171.205 as finalized.182\nWe made\nmodifications to the titles and introductory text of all of the finalized exceptions for reasons\ndescribed in section VIII.D of this preamble (under the heading “modifications”). As\nfinalized, § 171.205(a)(1) requires, in order to meet the condition in § 171.205(a), that when\nan actor implements a practice that makes health IT under that actor’s control temporarily\nunavailable, or temporarily degrades the performance of health IT, in order to perform\nmaintenance or improvements to the health IT, the actor’s practice must be implemented for a\nperiod of time no longer than necessary to complete the maintenance or improvements for\nwhich the health IT was made unavailable or the health IT’s performance degraded.\n\nUnavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be implemented in\na consistent and non-discriminatory manner\nWe proposed (in proposed § 171.207(a)(2)) that any unavailability of health IT\noccasioned by the conduct of maintenance or improvements must be implemented in a\nconsistent and non-discriminatory manner (84 FR 7551). We explained that this condition\nprovides a basic assurance that when health IT is made unavailable for the purpose of\nperforming maintenance or improvements the unavailability is not abused by the actor that\ncontrols the health IT. However, we indicated that this condition would not require that actors\nconduct all planned maintenance or improvements simultaneously, or require that every health\nIT contract provide the same promises in regard to planned maintenance or improvements. We\nfurther noted that a recipient of health IT could agree to a longer window for unavailability in\nexchange for a reduced fee for system maintenance, which would not contravene this\ncondition of this exception.\n\n182\nAs noted above in this section of this preamble, titles of all the finalized exceptions have been revised to be more\nclear and easy to understand.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters expressed support for requiring practices be\nimplemented in a non-discriminatory manner to meet the conditions of the Health IT\nPerformance Exception. One commenter supported the requirement but stated that they\nbelieved practices applied selectively against an actor or third-party application\ninappropriately accessing interoperability resources should be exempt from this condition.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate the opportunity to clarify two points. First, we want to\nreiterate that there is an important distinction between conduct of individuals or entities (or the\nbehavior of applications) that poses a security risk and conduct or behavior that may merely\nadversely affect performance of a health IT system or its core functions. If an actor or an\napplication is making or attempting unauthorized access to systems or to EHI, the actor with\ncontrol of the system subject to that security risk should take prompt action to address that\nrisk. As stated in the finalized § 171.205(d), the Health IT Performance Exception expressly\ndoes not apply to security-related practices. If the unavailability of health IT for maintenance\nor improvements is initiated by an actor in response to a security risk to electronic health\ninformation, the actor does not need to satisfy the conditions of § 171.205, but must comply\nwith all applicable conditions of § 171.203 at all relevant times if they wish to seek the added\nassurance of conforming their practices to an exception to the information blocking provision.\n\nSecond, we recognize there are circumstances where an application’s behavior does not pose a\nsecurity risk but does adversely impact the performance of a health IT system’s overall or core\nfunctions performance. We decline to modify § 171.205(a)(2) in the manner the commenter\nrecommended in order to address adverse impacts on health IT performance. Instead, in\nresponse to this and other comments, we have finalized in § 171.205(b) an alternative\ncondition that expressly provides for the finalized Health IT Performance Exception to apply\nto practices implemented to mitigate a third-party application’s negative impact on an actor’s\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT’s performance.\n\nUnavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements must be agreed\nIn order to benefit from this exception, we proposed that the unavailability of health IT\ndue to maintenance or improvements initiated by a health IT developer of certified health IT,\nHIE, or HIN, must be agreed to by the individual or entity to whom the health IT is supplied\n(84 FR 7551). We noted that the availability of health IT is typically addressed in a written\ncontract or other written agreements, that puts the recipient of the health IT on notice about the\nlevel of EHI and health IT unavailability that can be expected for users of the health IT. By\nsuch agreements, the recipient of the health IT willfully agrees to that level of planned and\nunplanned unavailability (typically referred to in health IT contracts as “downtime”). We\nproposed that in circumstances where health IT needs to be taken offline for maintenance or\nimprovements on an urgent basis and in a way that is not expressly permitted under a health\nIT contract an actor could satisfy the proposed condition so long as the maintenance or\nimprovements are agreed to by the recipient of the health IT. We proposed that this could be\nachieved by way of an oral agreement such as reached between the parties by telephone, but\nwe noted that because an actor must demonstrate that it satisfies the conditions of this\nexception, it would be best practice for an actor to ensure the agreement was in writing or, at\nminimum, contemporaneously documented.\n\nWe proposed that this condition would only apply when the unavailability of health IT\nis caused by a health IT developer of certified health IT, HIE, or HIN because it is the supplier\nof the health IT and thus controls if and when health IT is intentionally taken offline for\nmaintenance or improvements. We proposed that this condition would not apply when health\nIT is made unavailable for maintenance or improvements at the initiative of a recipient (or\ncustomer) of health IT, noting that when it is a customer of health IT who initiates\n\n\n\n\nunavailability, the unavailability would not need to be the subject of an agreement with the\nsupplier of that health IT, nor anyone else, in order for the customer of health IT to benefit\nfrom this exception.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters from the provider community recommended advance\nnotice of downtime. Several commenters from the provider community suggested that planned\ndowntimes should be documented, scheduled, and executed within a predefined window of\ntime. One commenter recommended that actors create a public website that displays planned\nand unplanned system downtime and allow other actors to subscribe to notifications of these\ndowntimes. One commenter suggested we explicitly prohibit an entity from regularly\nscheduling extensive time periods where query and response services are unavailable. Another\ncommenter suggested we make allowances within the conditions of this exception for an actor\nwho may fall slightly out of compliance with terms agreed to regarding downtime in a service\nlevel agreement if the impact is de minimis and the actor was acting in good faith. One\ncommenter contended that the information blocking provisions should not regulate the level of\nservice provided by health IT developers to their customers. We also received several\ncomments from members of the HIE and HIN community that recommended against any\nrequirement to include specific details such as dates and times for maintenance because such a\nrequirement could result in HIEs and HINs having to undertake the process of amending\nthousands of legal agreements.\n\n*Response.* We do not believe it is necessary to dictate the availability or health IT or\nother contractually defined details of the business relationship between parties for the\npurposes of this exception. Parties to a health IT contract can determine and communicate\ntheir respective service level needs and capabilities or commitments in legally enforceable\ncontracts. Contractual provisions can establish specific details of service levels, planned\n\n\n\n\ndowntime, unplanned downtime, and communications regarding planned and unplanned\ndowntime, that are practical and appropriate to the context of a particular contract. In the event\nparties do not honor such contract provisions, remedies are available to the parties outside and\nindependent of part 171. We also agree with commenters’ observations that any specific\nrequirements, such as those recommended by some other commenters, could require\namending contracts in ways that could create significant burden and costs for actors. Thus, we\ndid not modify this exception in response to commenters’ recommendations that we require\nservice level or other contractual agreements between parties conform to specific prescribed\ntimeframes, scheduling (including specifically or query and response services), notice, and\nscope of planned downtimes expectations in order for maintenance and improvement health IT\ndowntimes to meet the information blocking exception for maintenance and improvement.\n\nSimilarly, we have not modified the exception in response to recommendations from some\ncommenters that we require display of planned and unplanned downtime on publicly available\nwebsites. We are not persuaded such measures would generally render benefits commensurate\nwith the time and effort that would be needed for actors to implement and maintain them.\n\n*Comments.* Two commenters disagreed with our proposed requirement that temporary\nunavailability initiated by a health IT developer of certified health IT, HIE, or HIN must be\nagreed to by the individual or entity to whom the health IT developer of certified health IT,\nHIE, or HIN supplied the health IT. Both commenters recommended removing the “agreed\nupon with user” provision we proposed and recommended that ONC eliminate the\nrequirement for prior agreement of planned downtime in order to meet the conditions of this\nexception. These commenters suggested that we instead allow for unilateral notice to\norganizations at least 10 days prior to scheduled maintenance.\n\n*Response.* We continue to believe that unplanned downtime must be done with the\n\n\n\n\nagreement of the individual or entity to which the health IT is supplied. This condition\nprotects health care providers and other uses or health IT under the specific circumstance of\nhealth IT being made temporarily unavailable due to unplanned maintenance or\nimprovements. It also reduces the potential for downtime purportedly for purposes of health\nIT maintenance or improvement to be a pretext for information blocking and thus makes it\nless likely that this exception will be abused. However, the conditions of this exception\nfinalized in § 171.205 can be met by unplanned downtime in the absence of contemporaneous\nagreement so long as it is consistent with an existing service level agreement. We also note\nthat specific agreement by all users to temporary unavailability is not required in all instances\nof unplanned downtime not already covered by an existing service level or other contractual\nagreement, such as downtime resulting from events beyond the actor’s control that prevent it\nfrom meeting the requirement, and practices that are consistent with the conditions of the\nPreventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201), Security Exception (§ 171.203), or Infeasibility\nException (§ 171.204).\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters from the developer community expressed\nappreciation for the opportunity to comment on throttling, arguing that it is a reasonable\napproach to maintain access to functionality. Many of these commenters stated that, when\napplied with the agreement of health IT users, strategies such as throttling or metering certain\nhealth IT functions should not be considered information blocking. One commenter suggested\nthat throttling should not be considered information blocking if the health IT developer or\nhealth care provider is forced to throttle access so as not to negatively impact hospital\noperations. The commenter recommended that when requests for EHI from third-party\napplications created an unreasonable and significant burden on health IT and the installed\ninfrastructure, the two contracting parties could mutually agree that the third-party application\n\n\n\n\nwas poorly designed and could be throttled or even denied access. Another commenter\nsuggested that the practice of throttling should only occur if that portion of the health IT\naffected by an application is impacting highly critical functions such as inpatient or\nemergency department care delivery and documentation. The commenter stated that it was\nimportant to distinguish between the practice of throttling generally and the practice of\nthrottling as a response to impact on critical functions because the practice of throttling\ngenerally could be applied too broadly.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate commenters’ input. We recognize that in some circumstances\nit may be appropriate for actors to take action (e.g., deny access, throttle, or meter) to limit the\nnegative impact on the performance of health IT that may result from the technical design,\nfeatures, or behavior of a third-party application. This would include, but not be limited to,\nthird-party applications that a patient might choose to use to access their EHI. The regulation\ntext finalized in § 171.205 has been expanded, in comparison to the text proposed in §\n171.207 (84 FR 7605), to include paragraph (b), which we have titled “assured level of\nperformance.” As finalized, § 171.205(b) establishes a condition expressly applicable to\nactions taken against a third-party application that is negatively impacting the health IT’s\nperformance. The specific requirements for action against a third-party application to meet the\ncondition finalized in § 171.205(b) and thus be excepted from the definition of information\nblocking parallel the requirements finalized in § 171.205(a), the condition applicable to\npractices that make health IT temporarily unavailable, or its performance degraded, for\npurposes of maintenance and improvement.\n\nTo meet the Health IT Performance Exception under the assured level of performance\ncondition, an action against a third-party application (§ 171.205(b)) must be: (1) for a period\nof time no longer than necessary to resolve any negative impacts; (2) implemented in a\n\n\n\n\nconsistent and non-discriminatory manner; and (3) consistent with existing service level\nagreements, where applicable. For example, if the service level agreement stated how and to\nwhat extent negative impacts should be addressed (e.g., over-capacity), then it is expected that\nsuch provisions of an existing service level agreement would be followed unless they violated\none of the other requirements of the (§ 171.205(b)) assured level of performance condition\n(e.g., resulted in discriminatory application or lasted longer than necessary to resolve the\nnegative impacts). We believe this approach will help to address situations where actions such\nas throttling become necessary to protect the overall performance of health IT.\n\nInteraction with the Preventing Harm and Security Exceptions\nWe proposed that when health IT is made unavailable for maintenance or\nimprovements aimed at preventing harm to a patient or other person, or securing EHI, an actor\nmust comply with the conditions specified in the proposed Harm Exception or proposed\nSecurity Exception, respectively, in order for these particular practices to be excepted from the\ndefinition of information blocking in § 171.103.\n\n*Comments.* We received a few comments that expressed concern that our maintenance\nexception, as proposed, did not address unplanned downtime without notice in the instance of\na potential threat to security of EHI.\n\n*Response.* Unplanned downtime or other practices reasonable and necessary in\nresponse to exigent threats to EHI security should be implemented consistent with the\nconditions for the Security Exception as finalized in § 171.203. We expressly stated in the\nproposed regulation text at § 171.207(c), and have finalized in § 171.205(d), that if the\nunavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements is initiated by an actor in\nresponse to a security risk to EHI, the actor does not need to satisfy the conditions of the\nHealth IT Performance Exception, but must comply with all conditions of § 171.203 at all\n\n\n\n\nrelevant times for such practices to be excepted from the definition of information blocking in\n§ 171.103. We believe this paragraph of the finalized Health IT Maintenance Exception’s\nregulation text (finalized in § 171.205(d)) provides ample clarity that this exception is not\nintended to apply to unplanned downtime implemented specifically in response to emergent\nsecurity threats. We have finalized this approach to the relationship between the Health IT\nPerformance Exception and Security Exception as proposed, because we continue to believe it\nensures that the Health IT Performance Exception cannot be used to avoid compliance with\nconditions applicable under the Security Exception when the practice leading to unplanned\ndowntime is implemented specifically in response to a risk to security of EHI.\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments from stakeholders in the developer\ncommunity that it would be impossible for certified health IT developers, HIEs, or HINs to\nmeet the conditions of this exception as proposed in the event of downtime as a result of\nsomething like a natural disaster because those parties would be unable to secure agreement\nfrom entities and individuals prior to uncontrollable downtime.\n\n*Response.* The Infeasibility Exception finalized in § 171.204 has been revised, in\ncomparison to the proposed regulation text in the Proposed Rule, to expressly address\nuncontrollable events. In cases of natural or human-made disaster, public health emergency,\npublic safety, incident war, terrorist attack, civil insurrection, strike or other labor unrest,\ntelecommunication or internet service interruption, or act of military, civil or regulatory\nauthority, an actor can avail itself of the Infeasibility Exception. We determined these\nsituations should be addressed in the Infeasibility Exception rather than the Health IT\nPerformance Exception in part because the breadth of circumstances where access, exchange,\nor use of EHI may be interfered with due to these uncontrollable events is more consistent\nwith the intent and function of the Infeasibility Exception. Thus, we have not modified the\n\n\n\n\nHealth IT Maintenance Exception (§ 171.205) to address uncontrollable events of the type\nexpressly addressed by the finalized Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204).\n\nWe have finalized the substance of the relationship between the Health IT\nMaintenance Exception and the Preventing Harm and Security Exceptions as proposed. We\nhave also finalized as proposed the provisions of the Health IT Maintenance Exception\nspecific to “practices that prevent harm” and ”security-related practices,” but have\nredesignated them within the structure of the Health IT Maintenance Exception as finalized in\n§ 171.205 in comparison to the structure proposed at § 171.207 (84 FR 7605). Specifically,\nthe “practices that prevent harm” provision is finalized in paragraph (c) of the finalized\nHealth IT Maintenance Exception in § 171.205 instead of paragraph (b) as was the case in the\nProposed Rule (84 FR 7605). Likewise, the “security-related practices” provision is finalized\nin paragraph (d) of the finalized Health IT Maintenance Exception in § 171.205 instead of\nparagraph (c) as was the case in the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7605). Both of these provisions\nwere moved down to accommodate the addition of the “assured level of performance”\ncondition as paragraph (b) of § 171.205 as finalized.\n\nThe paragraph of the Health IT Maintenance Exception finalized in § 171.205(c),\nspecific to “practices that prevent harm,” continues to provide that if the unavailability of\nhealth IT for maintenance or improvements is initiated by an actor in response to a risk of\nharm to a patient or another person, the actor does not need to satisfy the requirements of this\nsection, but must comply with all conditions of § 171.201 at all relevant times to qualify for an\nexception. Likewise, the paragraph of the Health IT Maintenance Exception finalized in §\n171.205(d), specific to “security-related practices,” continues to provide that if the\nunavailability of health IT for maintenance or improvements is initiated by an actor in\nresponse to a security risk to electronic health information, the actor does not need to satisfy\n\n\n\n\nthe requirements of this section, but must comply with all conditions of § 171.203 at all\nrelevant times to qualify for an exception.\n\nRequest for Comment\nWe requested comments on the exception in general, and on whether the proposed\nconditions would impose appropriate limitations on actor-initiated health IT maintenance or\nimprovement activities that lead to temporary unavailability of EHI.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments generally opposed to the establishment of\nthis exception. One commenter recommended that if a patient is affected by a practice that\ncould be recognized under this exception, such as unavailability of health IT for an app\nregistration, the patient should be provided an opportunity to access the EHI through another\nmeans, such as the patient portal.\n\n*Response.* The Health IT Performance Exception is applicable to a variety of specific\npractices making health IT unavailable. It does not recognize only downtime or performance\ndegradation of an actor’s entire health IT system. An actor who takes down one means of EHI\naccess to conduct health IT maintenance or improvement could provide alternative access to\nEHI, in circumstances where this may be practical, and remain in compliance with the\nrequirements for their practices to be excepted under § 171.205 from the definition of\ninformation blocking in § 171.103. However, we stress that an actor conducting maintenance\nor improvement of health IT in the actor’s control is not required to provide an alternative\nelectronic health information access mechanism during the downtime in order for the Health\nIT Performance Exception to apply to the actor’s maintenance or improvement practices. We\nare aware that actors’ operational contexts and existing health IT capabilities vary\nsubstantially throughout the health IT ecosystem. In a variety of circumstances where\ndowntime or performance degradation may be reasonable and necessary to maintain or\n\n\n\n\nimprove health IT performance, an actor may not have the capability needed to meet a\nrequirement that EHI must always be immediately available in response to every patient\nrequest. For example, in some circumstances it may be impossible to achieve a particular\nmaintenance or improvement purpose within a specific system without temporarily rendering\nall EHI in the system unavailable to all functions, services, and other components of the\nsystem (such as APIs and portals) through which EHI is ordinarily accessed, exchanged, or\nused.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "\n\nIn this final rule, we have established a new exception in § 171.301 (referred to as the\nContent and Manner Exception) under section 3022(a)(3) of the PHSA as a means to identify\nreasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. Although we\ndid not propose this exception in the Proposed Rule, it is related to our proposals and requests\nfor comment in the Proposed Rule regarding the proposed EHI definition (84 FR 7513) and\nthe proposed requirement to identify and provide a reasonable alternative means for\naccessing, exchanging, or using EHI as part of the proposed Infeasibility Exception (84 FR\n7544). We discuss below the connection between these proposals and requests for comment\nin the Proposed Rule and the conditions in the Content and Manner Exception.\n\nWe note that a failure to meet the Content and Manner Exception does not mean that\nan actor’s practice meets the information blocking definition. However, as we noted in the\n\n\n\n\nProposed Rule, the broad definition of information blocking in the Cures Act means that any\npractice that is likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI implicates the\ninformation blocking provision (see 84 FR 7515). As a result, practices that do not meet the\nContent and Manner Exception will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine,\nfor example, the actor’s intent and whether the practice rises to the level of an interference.\n\nWe discuss the comments received regarding the proposals related to the EHI definition (84\nFR 7513) and the requirement to identify and provide a reasonable alternative means for\naccessing, exchanging, or using EHI under the Infeasibility Exception (84 FR 7544) below.\n\n*Comments.* As discussed in more detail section VIII.C.3, we received many comments\nexpressing concerns regarding the breadth of the proposed EHI definition and requesting\nflexibility in the implementation of the information blocking provision. Many commenters\nstated that it would be difficult for actors to provide the full scope of EHI as it was proposed to\nbe defined, particularly as soon as the final rule was published. Some commenters opined that\nwe were trying to do too much too fast. Commenters requested that we provide flexibility for\nactors to adjust to the scope of the EHI definition, as well as the exceptions. Commenters\nasserted that such an approach would permit them to adapt their processes, technologies, and\nsystems to enable the access, exchange, and use of EHI as required by the Cures Act and this\nfinal rule. Some commenters suggested that EHI under the information blocking provision\nshould be limited to ePHI as defined in 45 CFR 160.103, while others requested that ONC\nconsider constraining the EHI covered by the information blocking provision to only the data\nincluded in the USCDI.\n\nWe also received a range of comments requesting clarification and concerning\nimprovements to our proposal in the Infeasibility Exception that, for any request that the actor\nclaims is infeasible, the actor must work with the requesting party in a timely manner to\n\n\n\n\nidentify and provide a reasonable alternative means of accessing, exchanging, or using the\nEHI, as applicable (proposed in § 171.205(d), 84 FR 7604). Commenters, primarily provider\norganizations, were supportive of the proposed condition. Some commenters requested\nclarification and additional examples about what manner of response would constitute a\n“reasonable alternative” and when it would be acceptable to enable requestors to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in an alternative manner. One commenter requested that ONC place\nguardrails around requests for information sharing, such that if an actor is able to share data in\nan industry-accepted format, the requesting organization cannot make an information blocking\nclaim if that format does not meet the organization’s preferred, specific data transmission\nstandard. One commenter requested that ONC clarify that the proposed requirement to\nidentify a reasonable alternative means of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI is only\nnecessary where any such alternative exists. The commenter noted that there could be\ninstances in which no reasonable alternative exists, and the request is in effect impossible to\ncomply with.\n\nA few commenters requested that ONC remove the requirement that an actor both\n“identify” and “provide” a reasonable alternative means of accessing EHI, and instead require\nonly that an actor “identify” a reasonable alternative. One commenter expressed concern that\nthis exception could be used to send patients to other sources to get their health information\nbecause that approach would be less burdensome than providing the information to the patient\nin the manner requested. The commenter recommended that ONC preclude the use of this\nexception for patient access requests.\n\nSome provider, hospital, and clinical data registry commenters expressed concern\nregarding the potential burden on the actor related to identifying and providing a reasonable\nalternative means of accessing, exchanging or using the EHI. Other commenters, primarily\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT developers, expressed concern regarding the potential impact and burden on health\nIT developers, HINs, and HIEs of complying with a request to access, exchange, or use EHI,\nespecially when the request requires custom development. Some commenters also noted that\nthe proposed exception seems imbalanced, favoring the requester of the EHI over the actor\nproviding the EHI.\n\n*Response.* The Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301 addresses the two groups\nof comments noted above: (1) comments expressing concerns regarding the breadth of the\nproposed EHI definition (proposed in § 171.102, 84 FR 7601) and requesting flexibility in the\nimplementation of the information blocking provision; and (2) comments requesting\nclarification concerning and improvement to our proposal in the Infeasibility Exception\nregarding the provision of a reasonable alternative (proposed in § 171.205(d), 84 FR 7604). In\nresponse to these comments, we have removed the reasonable alternative provision from the\nInfeasibility Exception and we have finalized the Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301\nwhich describes the content (i.e., the EHI) required to be provided in an actor’s response to a\nrequest to access, exchange, or use EHI and the manner in which an actor must fulfill the\nrequest in order to satisfy the exception. We believe this new exception will address the broad\nrange of comments we received about the content of an actor’s response to and manner for\nfulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI, and will provide the clarity and\ntransparency sought by commenters. We also believe, as discussed in more detail below, that\nthis new exception provides market participants the ability to reach and maintain market\nnegotiated terms for the access, exchange, and use of EHI.\n\nContent\nThe first condition of this exception (“content condition”) in § 171.301(a) establishes\nthe content an actor must provide in response to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in\n\n\n\n\norder to meet this exception. As discussed in section VIII.C.3 of this preamble, we have\nfocused the scope of the EHI definition in this final rule to ePHI as defined in 45 CFR 160.103\nto the extent that it would be included in a designated record set as defined in 45 CFR\n164.501, with limited exception. We also address commenter concerns regarding the scope of\nthe EHI definition and the pace at which we are implementing the information blocking\nprovision through the Content and Manner Exception. Specifically, section 171.301(a)(1)\nstates that for up to May 2, 2022, an actor must respond to a request to access, exchange, or\nuse EHI with, at a minimum, the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the United\nStates Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard adopted in § 170.213. Section\n171.301(a)(2) states that on and after May 2, 2022, an actor must respond to a request to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI with EHI as defined in § 171.102.\n\nWe explained in section VIII.C of this final rule that we have finalized a new\nparagraph in the information blocking definition in § 171.103 that aligns with the content\ncondition described above. That new paragraph, which is finalized in § 171.103(b), states that,\nuntil May 2, 2022, EHI for purposes of part 171 is limited to the EHI identified by the data\nelements represented in the USCDI standard adopted in § 170.213. We have included a\ndetailed discussion in section VIII.C of our rationale for including the content condition in the\nContent and Manner Exception and for including paragraph (b) in § 171.103. That discussion\nincludes an explanation of how those provisions address the commenters’ concerns detailed\nabove. We refer readers to the discussion in section VIII.C.\n\nManner\nThe second condition of this exception (“manner condition”) in § 171.301(b)\nestablishes the manner in which an actor must fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use EHI\nin order to meet this exception. This condition is similar to our proposal in the Infeasibility\n\n\n\n\nException in the Proposed Rule that, for any request the actor claims is infeasible, the actor\nmust have worked with the requesting party in a timely manner to identify and provide a\nreasonable alternative means of accessing, exchanging, or using the EHI, as applicable (see\nproposed § 171.205(d), 84 FR 7604). We explained in the Proposed Rule that this proposed\ncondition would minimize the risk that the Infeasibility Exception could protect improper\nrefusals to enable access, exchange or use of EHI, including discriminatory blanket refusals as\nwell as other practices, such as improper delays for access or exchange that would present\ninformation blocking concerns (84 FR 7544).\n\nAfter review of comments, further consideration of proposed conditions, and taking\ninto account the revised structure of the exceptions, we determined that the concept of\nproviding a “reasonable alternative” fits better in the Content and Manner Exception than in\nthe Infeasibility Exception. As such, we removed the “reasonable alternative” requirement\nfrom the Infeasibility Exception and incorporated the general concept into the Content and\nManner Exception. We believe this approach improves on the “reasonable alternative”\nrequirement in the Proposed Rule by clarifying actors’ obligations for providing access,\nexchange, or use of EHI in all situations; creating actionable technical procedures; and\naligning the requirement for providing an alternative with the Fees and Licensing Exceptions.\n\nUnder § 171.301(b)(1), an actor must fulfill a request described in the content\ncondition (paragraph (a) of the exception) in any manner requested, unless the actor is\ntechnically unable to fulfill the request or cannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor to\nfulfill the request (§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)). If an actor fulfills a request described in the content\ncondition in any manner requested: (1) any fees charged by the actor in relation to its\nresponse are not required to satisfy the Fees Exception in § 171.302; and (2) any license of\ninteroperability elements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the request is not\n\n\n\n\nrequired to satisfy the Licensing Exception in § 171.303 (§ 171.301(b)(1)(ii)).\n\nSection 171.301(b)(2) provides requirements for fulfilling a request to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in an alternative manner than the manner requested. If an actor does not\nfulfill a request described in the content condition of this exception in any manner requested\nbecause it is technically unable to fulfill the request or cannot reach agreeable terms with the\nrequestor to fulfill the request, the actor must fulfill the request in an alternative manner in\norder to satisfy the exception. Section 171.301(b)(2)(i) states that the actor must fulfill the\nrequest without unnecessary delay in the following order of priority, starting with the first\nparagraph and only proceeding to the next consecutive paragraph if the actor is technically\nunable to fulfill the request in the manner identified in a paragraph. That order of priority is as\nfollows: (1) using technology certified to standard(s) adopted in part 170 that is specified by\nthe requestor (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(A)); (2) using content and transport standards specified by\nthe requestor and published by the Federal Government or a standards developing\norganization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)183\n(§\n171.301(b)(2)(i)(B)); and (3) using an alternative machine-readable format, including the\nmeans to interpret the EHI, agreed upon with the requestor (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(C)). Section\n171.301(b)(2)(ii) requires that any fees charged by the actor in relation to fulfilling the\nrequest must satisfy the Fees Exception in § 171.302. Similarly, § 171.301(b)(2)(iii) requires\nthat any license of interoperability elements granted by the actor in relation to fulfilling the\nrequest is required to satisfy the Licensing Exception in § 171.303.\n\nWe chose this approach because we believe actors should, first and foremost, attempt\nto fulfill requests to access, exchange, or use EHI in the manner requested. This principle is\n183\nSee https://www.ansi.org/.\n\n\n\n\ncentral to our information blocking policies (e.g., it was part of the proposed Infeasibility\nException) and will help ensure that EHI is made available where and when it is needed. Our\napproach acknowledges, however, that there may be instances when an actor should not be\nrequired to respond in the manner requested.\n\nFirst, if an actor is technically unable to fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use\nEHI in the manner requested, the actor is allowed to fulfill the request in an alternative manner\n(§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)). We emphasize that we use “technically unable” in this context to mean\nthat actors cannot fulfill a request to access, exchange, or use EHI due to technical limitation.\n\nFor example, if an individual requested their EHI via an API and the actor could not fulfill the\nrequest via the API, but the individual then requested the EHI be provided via email and the\nactor was technically able to do so, we expect that the actor would fulfill the request in that\n“manner requested.” This standard sets a very high bar, and would not be met if the actor is\ntechnically able to fulfill the request, but chooses not to fulfill the request in the manner\nrequested due to cost, burden, or similar justifications. If, for instance, under the alternative\nmanner, fulfilling the request would prove costly for the actor, the actor would be able to\ncharge a fee that results in a reasonable profit margin under the Fees Exception in § 171.302\nor license any requisite interoperability elements and make reasonable royalties under the\nLicensing Exception in § 171.303. If the burden on the actor for fulfilling the request is so\nsignificant that the actor chooses not to fulfill the request at all, the actor could seek coverage\nunder the Infeasibility Exception in § 171.204. We believe this framework for utilizing this\nexception, which works in harmony with the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204), Fees\nException (§ 171.302), and Licensing Exception (§ 171.303), is principled and tailored in a\nmanner that will promote basic fairness and encourage parties to work cooperatively to\nimplement efficient solutions to interoperability challenges.\n\n\n\n\nSecond, we establish that an actor is not required to fulfill a request to access,\nexchange, or use EHI in the manner requested if the actor cannot reach agreeable terms with\nthe requestor to fulfill the request (§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)). We also establish that if an actor\nfulfills a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in any manner requested, the fees or\nlicenses associated with fulfilling such requests will not be limited by the conditions in the\nFees Exception or Licensing Exception. These provisions will allow actors to first attempt to\nnegotiate agreements in any manner requested with whatever terms the actor chooses and at\nthe “market” rate—which supports innovation and competition. We then allow flexibility for\nactors to still satisfy the exception by fulfilling the request in an alternative manner if the actor\ncannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor to fulfill the request. For instance, under the\nexception, actors who cannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor to fulfill the request\nare not required to license their IP to proprietary technology in order to satisfy the exception.\n\nIn contrast, § 171.301(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) require that any fees charged or licenses\ngranted by the actor in relation to fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in an\nalternative manner must satisfy the Fees Exception in § 171.302 and the Licensing Exception\nin § 171.303. We recognize that it is possible that responding in an alternative manner may\nrequire licensing of interoperability elements. However, we do not believe that, in most cases,\nlicensing certified technology (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(A)) or standards-based technology (§\n171.301(b)(2)(i)(B)) would involve the type of licensing of proprietary interoperability\nelements that concerned the majority of commenters because the standards in §\n171.301(b)(2)(i)(a) and (B) are “open” standards. Therefore, it is our understanding that a\nhealth IT developer of certified health IT would not normally be required to license its IP in\norder to meet the requirements for fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in those\nalternative manners. On the other hand, the technology/software that the developer uses to\n\n\n\n\nfulfill a request in any manner requested could constitute the developer’s IP, depending on the\nrequest. We emphasize that this exception does not require developers to open-source their\ntechnology/software.\n\nFor instance, if a health IT developer of certified health IT enables access to EHI using\nHL7 (which is an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization) FHIR Release 2 (R2)\nStandard, that means the developer will provide EHI in the format specified in FHIR R2. In\nthis example, the actual software code that is used by the developer to convert the EHI from\nthe developer’s proprietary format to FHIR R2 is the developer’s IP and is not required to be\nprovided to the requestor. We also note that our experience and knowledge of the health IT\nlandscape indicate that the market is increasingly moving toward open standards, and we\nbelieve this movement will further decrease the need to license IP in the future. We believe\nthis framework and approach are supportive of innovation and address commenter concerns\nregarding their ability to protect their IP.\n\nWe included in § 171.301(b)(2)(i) that an actor must fulfill the request without\nunnecessary delay in order to make clear that actors seeking coverage under this exception by\nresponding in an alternative manner will be held to same unnecessary delay or “timeliness”\nconsiderations as all actors are in determining whether there is an interference under the\ninformation blocking provision. The fact that an actor responds in an alternative manner does\nnot entitle that actor to any additional time to respond to a request to access, exchange, or use\nof EHI that the actor would not be afforded if responding in any manner requested. As such,\nany unnecessary delays related to responding in an alternative manner could disqualify an\nactor from meeting the alternative manner condition in the same way that an unnecessary\ndelay in responding to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in any manner requested\ncould constitute an interference. We refer readers to the discussion of “Limiting or Restricting\n\n\n\n\nthe Interoperability of Health IT” in section VIII.C.6.c.ii.\n\nUnder § 171.301(b)(2)(i)(A), if an actor does not fulfill a request described in the\ncontent condition of this exception in any manner requested because it is technically unable\nto fulfill the request or cannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor to fulfill the request,\nthe actor must fulfill the request in an alternative manner. Specifically, the actor must attempt\nto fulfill the request using technology certified to standards adopted in part 170 specified by\nthe requestor. This manner of response is given precedence because it advances a certified,\nstandards-based approach that supports the Promoting Interoperability Programs (previously\nMedicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs) administered by the Centers for Medicare\n& Medicaid Services (CMS), other Federal and State programs that use certified health IT,\nand other Federal Departments (Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs). In addition,\nthe certification criteria under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (the Program) include\nrobust oversight, including technical and interoperability requirements, ONC-Authorized\nCertification Body (ONC-ACB) in-the-field surveillance expectations, and cost transparency\nand other disclosure requirements. To illustrate how this would work, if the requestor only\nrequests the EHI using the C-CDA 2.1 content standard, then the actor would not have to also\nuse the Direct transport standard to provide the EHI. However, if the requestor requests the\nEHI through the use of both standards, then the actor would be expected to respond in such a\nmanner if the actor has certified health IT that supports both standards.\n\nIf the actor is technically unable to respond using technology certified to standards\nadopted in part 170 specified by the requestor, then the actor may respond using content and\ntransport standards specified by the requestor and published by the Federal Government or a\nstandards developing organization accredited by the ANSI (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(B)). We chose\nto specify that standards published by a standards developing organization accredited by ANSI\n\n\n\n\nwould qualify for this manner of response because ANSI oversees the development of\nvoluntary consensus standards in the United States and it accredits standards that are\ndeveloped by representatives of other standards organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies\nthat the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institute’s\nrequirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process. Voluntary consensus\nstandards developed by an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization carry a high\ndegree of acceptance both in United States and internationally. ANSI has broad membership\nacross government agencies, industry, academia, and international bodies and is the official\nUnited States representative to the International Organization of Standards (ISO). This manner\nof response also advances interoperability through standards-based exchange, even if the\nstandard is not certified under the Program.\n\nAs noted above, the “manner” of response specific in § 171.301(b)(2)(i)(B) includes\ntwo distinct components: (1) content standard; and (2) transport standard. The content\nstandard deals with whether the information is in an appropriate format and is universally\nunderstood. This standard includes the structure (i.e., syntax) and terminology (i.e., semantics)\nof the EHI. Examples of content standards include: US Fast Healthcare Interoperability\nResources (FHIR) Core IG; Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA 2.1); HL7\nV2.5.1; HL7 v2.7 (which is a standard that is not part of certification from an ANSI-accredited\nstandards developing organization); and Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide. The\ntransport standard is the method to connect two or more parties without a focus on the data\nthat is transported from one party to another. Put another way, the transport standard is the\nmethod by which information moves from one point to another. Examples of transport\nstandards include: Direct Project Standard, ONC Applicability Statement for Secure Health\nTransport, Version 1.0 (incorporated by reference in § 170.299) (§ 170.202(a)); and Simple\n\n\n\n\nObject Access Protocol (SOAP) based exchange specifications such as “Nationwide Health\nInformation Network Messaging Platform Specification.”184\nUnder the manner condition, an\nactor could proceed to the next consecutive “manner” under § 171.301(b)(2)(i) if the actor was\ntechnically unable to respond with either the content standard or the transport standard\nrequested.\n\nLast, if an actor is technically unable to fulfill a request for access, exchange, or use of\nEHI using a content and transport standard specified by the requestor and published by the\nFederal Government or a standards developing organization accredited by ANSI, only then\ncan the actor respond using an alternative machine-readable format, including the means to\ninterpret the EHI, agreed to by the actor and requestor (§ 171.301(b)(2)(i)(C)). This option to\nrespond using an agreed upon alternative machine-readable format is a flexible option for\nactors who cannot meet the “manner” requirements in § 171.301(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B), but still\nwant to be responsive to the requestor and seek coverage under this exception. Examples of\nalternative machine readable formats include CSV, public domain standards, public advisory\nstandards, and other community efforts used to represent the data.\n\nWe emphasize two key components of § 171.301(b)(2)(i)(C). First, the alternative\nmachine-readable format must include the means to interpret the EHI. The goal with this\nrequirement is to ensure that, if an actor fulfills a request for access, exchange, or use of EHI\nusing an alternative machine-readable format, the EHI provided through that format will be\nusable by the requestor. As an example, the format used for the EHI Export functionality (§\n170.315(b)(10)) discussed earlier in this final rule could be used to fulfill such a request.\n\n184\nSee ONC, Connecting Health and Care for the Nation, A Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap, FINAL\nVersion 1.0, https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hie-interoperability/nationwide-interoperability-roadmap-\nfinal-version-1.0.pdf; ONC, 2015 Interoperability Standards Advisory,\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/default/files/2015interoperabilitystandardsadvisory01232015final_for_public_co\nmment.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nSecond, the alternative machine-readable format must be agreed upon with the requestor. This\ncondition ensures that, even if the actor is technically unable to meet the requirements in §\n171.301(b)(2)(i)(A) and (B), the actor is still providing the requestor the opportunity to access,\nexchange, or use the EHI in a manner that is amenable to the requestor.\n\n\n",

                  "text": "We proposed in the Proposed Rule to establish an exception at § 171.204 (84 FR 7589)\nto the information blocking provision that would permit the recovery of certain costs\nreasonably incurred for the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We interpreted the definition of\ninformation blocking to include any fee that is likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI. We noted that this interpretation may be broader than necessary to address\ngenuine information blocking concerns and could have unintended consequences on\ninnovation and competition. Specifically, unless we establish an exception, actors may be\nunable to recover costs that they reasonably incur to develop technologies and provide\nservices that enhance interoperability. This could undermine the ultimate goals of the\ninformation blocking provision by diminishing incentives to invest in, develop, and\ndisseminate interoperable technologies and services that enable more robust access, exchange,\nand use of EHI. Therefore, we proposed to establish an exception that would permit the\nrecovery of certain costs that we believe are unlikely to present information blocking concerns\nand would generally promote innovation, competition, and consumer welfare, provided certain\nconditions are met. We emphasized that actors can make a reasonable profit under this\nexception, provided that all applicable conditions are met (84 FR 7538 through 7541).\n\nWe proposed that the exception would be subject to strict conditions to prevent its\n\n\n\n\npotential abuse. Specifically, we explained our concern that a broad or insufficiently tailored\nexception for the recovery of costs could protect rent-seeking, opportunistic fees, and\nexclusionary practices that interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI. We explained\nthat these practices fall within the definition of information blocking and reflect some of the\nmost serious concerns that motivated its enactment (see 84 FR 7538 and section VIII.B of this\npreamble). For example, in the Information Blocking Congressional Report,185\nwe cited\nevidence of wide variation in fees charged for health IT products and services. While we\ncautioned that the issue of fees is nuanced, and that variations in fees could be attributable in\npart to different technology architectures, service models, capabilities, service levels, and\nother factors, we concluded that these factors alone could not adequately explain all of the\nvariation in prices that we had observed. Based on these and other indications, we concluded\nthat some actors were engaging in opportunistic pricing practices or, in some cases, charging\nprices designed to deter connectivity or exchange with competing technologies or services. In\nthe time since we published the Information Blocking Congressional Report, these practices\nhave persisted and, in certain respects, become more pronounced. In a national survey of HIE\nexecutives published in 2017, 47 percent of respondents reported that EHR developers\n“often/routinely” charge high fees for exchange that are unrelated to cost, and another 40\npercent reported that they “sometimes” do. 186\nMeanwhile, we have continued to receive\ncredible evidence of rent-seeking and other opportunistic behaviors, such as fees for data\nexport and data portability that are not plausibly related to any time, materials, or other costs\nthat a developer would reasonably incur to provide these services. And, while some practices\n185\nONC, Information Blocking Congressional Report (April 2015),\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/reports/info_blocking_040915.pdf.\n\n186\nJulia Adler-Milstein and Eric Pfeifer, Information Blocking: Is It Occurring And What Policy Strategies Can\nAddress It?, 95 Milbank Quarterly 117, 124–25 (Mar. 2017), available at\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12247/full.\n\n\n\n\ndescribed in the Information Blocking Congressional Report have become less prevalent (such\nas the charging of per-transaction fees), other practices have emerged that are equally\nconcerning (84 FR 7538).\n\nAs just one illustration, some EHR developers have begun conditioning access or use\nof customer EHI on revenue-sharing or royalty agreements that bear no plausible relation to\nthe costs incurred by the EHR developer to grant access to the EHI. We have also heard of\ndiscriminatory pricing policies that have the obvious purpose and effect of excluding\ncompetitors from the use of interoperability elements. Many of the industry stakeholders who\nshared their perspectives with us in listening sessions prior to the Proposed Rule, including\nseveral health IT developers of certified health IT, condemned these practices and urged us to\nswiftly address them (84 FR 7538).\n\nIn light of these concerns, we proposed that this exception would apply only to the\nrecovery of certain costs and only when the actor’s methods for recovering such costs comply\nwith certain conditions at all relevant times. In general, these conditions would require that the\ncosts the actor recovered were reasonably incurred, did not reflect costs that are speculative or\nsubjective, were appropriately allocated, and based on objective and verifiable criteria.\n\nFurther, the exception would not apply to certain fees, such as those based on the profit or\nrevenue associated with the use of EHI (either being earned by the actor, or that could be\nrealized by another individual or entity) that exceed the actor’s reasonable costs for providing\naccess, exchange, or use of the EHI (84 FR 7539 through 7541).\n\nFinally, the exception would provide additional conditions applicable to fees charged\nin connection with: (1) the certified APIs described in § 170.404 (84 FR 7594); and (2) the\nEHI export criterion proposed in § 170.315(b)(10) (84 FR 7590) to support single patient EHI\nexport and to support the export of all EHI when a health care provider chooses to migrate\n\n\n\n\ninformation to another health IT system. We emphasized that access to EHI that is provisioned\nby supplying some form of physical media, such as paper copies (where the EHI is printed\nout), or where EHI is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not be a practice that implicated\nthe information blocking provision provided that the fee(s) charged for that access complied\nwith the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)) (84 FR 7539).\n\nClarification\nWe clarify that the Fees Exception we have finalized in this rule in no way supports or\nencourages the sale of EHI. We emphasize that this exception permits the recovery of certain\ncosts reasonably incurred for the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We note that many\nindividuals and entities who are considered “actors” under the information blocking provision\nare also subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and therefore prohibited from selling PHI unless\ncertain conditions are met, and in particular, receiving remuneration for a disclosure of PHI in\naccordance with 45 CFR 164.502(a)(5)(ii). This exception to the information blocking\ndefinition in no way affects existing HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance responsibilities of\nentities subject to the HIPAA Rules.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in general support of the proposed\nexception. Commenters appreciated ONC’s goal of addressing rent-seeking, opportunistic\nfees, and exclusionary practices that interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI.\n\nSome commenters suggested that ONC should take additional steps and measures to ensure\nthat the requirements under this exception are clear. A couple of commenters recommended\nthat fees and costs of information exchange should be made publicly available. Another\ncommenter suggested that ONC develop a process for actors to routinely report their use of\nthis exception, including specific timeframes for actors to submit information to ONC and for\nONC to determine whether the exception can be applied under specific circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of and feedback on this exception.\n\nWe appreciate the suggestions for improved transparency under this exception. We believe\nactors should have discretion to decide if they would like to enhance transparency by making\nfees and costs of information exchange publicly available. We believe that choosing not to\ndisclose fees, on its own, would not likely implicate the information blocking provision.\n\nFurther, while we wholeheartedly support the goal of enhanced transparency and commend\ncommenters’ desire to enhance transparency in the final rule, we believe their suggestions\ncould create additional burden for actors and such burden could outweigh the benefits of the\nmeasures they suggest. We will continue to consider steps to further promote transparency\nregarding our information blocking policies in future rulemakings.\n\nWe appreciate the comment that we should develop a process for letting actors know\nwhether this exception could be applied under certain circumstances. We may consider\ndeveloping materials in the future regarding the application of the exceptions should the need\narise. However, we believe the final rule clearly describes the conditions actors must meet in\norder to be covered by each exception, and informational materials are not necessary at this\ntime.\n\nRequirement that costs be reasonably incurred\nIn the Proposed Rule, we stated that, regardless of the type of cost at issue, a basic\ncondition of the proposed exception was that any costs the actor seeks to recover must have\nbeen reasonably incurred to provide the relevant interoperability elements for the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI. Whether a cost was reasonably incurred will ultimately depend on\nthe particular facts and circumstances. We requested comment on considerations that may be\nrelevant to assessing the reasonableness of costs incurred for purposes of this exception (84\nFR 7539).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested additional clarity in the final rule regarding\nvarious terms and concepts in the proposed exception. Commenters noted that many terms and\nconcepts regarding the reasonableness of fees, and which fees would or would not be\nconsidered “reasonably incurred” under the exception, were ambiguous and overly broad.\n\nSome commenters were concerned that such ambiguity and vagueness could undercut ONC’s\noverall intent to prevent rent-seeking and opportunistic fees and could create a loophole that\nwould enable actors to use the exception to continue to charge unreasonably high fees. Some\ncommenters requested additional examples of “costs reasonably incurred” under the\nexception. One commenter asked that ONC outline different cost categories (such as\ndevelopment costs, deployment costs, usage costs) and indicate which of those costs would or\nwould not fall under the exception. A couple of commenters requested that ONC explicitly\nstate that fees the actor pays to a developer for “Release of Information” (ROI) services and\ntechnology would be considered “costs reasonably incurred.”\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. Actors may choose to satisfy the conditions\nof this exception to be certain that the fees they charge for the access, exchange, or use of EHI\ndo not implicate the information blocking provision. We reiterate that failure to meet the\nexception does not mean that an actor’s practice related to charging fees meets the information\nblocking definition. However, as we explained in the Proposed Rule, we interpret the broad\ndefinition of information blocking in section 3022(a) of the PHSA to encompass any fee that\nis likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI (84 FR 7521). Fees that do not\nmeet this exception may implicate the information blocking provision and will have to be\nassessed on a case-by-case basis to determine, for example, the actor’s intent and whether the\npractice rises to the level of an interference. Consistent with the conditions of this exception,\nan actor seeking the significant protection afforded by this exception will have to assess the\n\n\n\n\nfees they charge in light of the costs incurred.\n\nWe emphasize that our intention with this exception is not to set any particular fees\nrelated to products or services for accessing, exchanging, or using EHI, but rather to allow the\nmarket to define the appropriate price for such products or services so long as certain methods\nare followed and certain criteria are met. We believe this approach is appropriate for this\nexception in light of the considerable diversity in the types of costs actors might incur and the\nrange of factors that could bear on the reasonableness of those costs. For example, the costs of\ndeveloping software may vary with the purposes it is intended to serve, the settings in which it\nwill be deployed, the types and scope of capabilities included, and the extent to which these\ndevelopment efforts build on existing development efforts and know-how. Additionally, the\ncosts of providing services, including the implementation of technology in production\nenvironments, may vary based on the technology design or architecture, individual customer\nneeds, local implementation conditions, and other factors. An analysis of the approach for\nrecovering costs will also account for different distribution and service models under which\nthe costs are calculated. For these reasons, we have decided not to specify cost categories,\nsuch as development costs, deployment costs, usage costs, or ROI services and technology\ncosts. However, we note that if an actor meets all necessary conditions of the finalized\nexception, the actor could recover such categories of cost under the exception.\n\nWe have taken a few distinct steps to clarify this exception and address the overall\nconcern from commenters regarding the clarity of this exception. First, we have restructured\nthe exception for clarity. We have changed the title of the exception from “Exception—\nRecovering costs reasonably incurred” to “When will an actor’s practice of charging fees for\naccessing, exchanging, or using electronic health information not be considered information\nblocking?” Throughout this final rule preamble, we use “Fees Exception” as a short form of\n\n\n\n\nthis title, for ease of reference. As stated in Section VIII.D of this final rule preamble, we have\nchanged the titles of all of the exceptions to questions to improve clarity. We have also edited\nthe wording of the introductory text in § 171.302, in comparison to that proposed (84 FR\n7603), so that it is consistent with the finalized title in § 171.302. We believe these\nconforming changes in wording of the introductory text also improve clarity in this section.\n\nWe have also divided the exception into three conditions in § 171.302—(a) Basis for\nfees condition; (b) Excluded fees condition; and (c) Compliance with the Conditions of\nCertification condition. We explain upfront in the introductory sentence of the exception that,\npursuant to these conditions, an actor may charge fees, including fees that result in a\nreasonable profit margin, for the access, exchange, or use of EHI without implicating the\ninformation blocking provision. We believe this framework provides actors with a clear\nroadmap for voluntarily satisfying the conditions of the exception. We discuss the substantive\nchanges we have made to these provisions in the discussion of each condition later in this\nsection of the preamble.\n\nWe also note that we have further clarified the fees allowed under this exception by\nfocusing the scope of the EHI definition (discussed in section VIII.C.3 of this preamble) and\nadding paragraph (b) to the information blocking definition in § 171.103 (discussed in section\nVIII.C of this preamble). By changing the definition of EHI to electronic protected health\ninformation (ePHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 included in a designated record set as\ndefined in 45 CFR 164.501, we have focused the scope of information covered by the\ninformation blocking provision. In addition, under the finalized information blocking\ndefinition, for up to 18 months after the six-month delayed compliance date of the information\nblocking section of this final rule (part 171) (a total of 24 months after the publication date of\nthis final rule), EHI for purposes of the information blocking definition is limited to the EHI\n\n\n\n\nidentified by the data elements represented in the USCDI standard adopted in § 170.213 (see\n(§ 171.103(b)).\n\nBasis for Fees Condition\nTo qualify for this exception, we proposed that the method by which the actor seeks to\nrecover its costs must meet certain conditions. We proposed that this would require that the\nactor base its recovery of costs on objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied\nfor all substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests. We proposed\nthat any differences in prices or price terms would have to be based on actual differences in\nthe costs that the actor incurred or other reasonable and non-discriminatory criteria. We\nfurther proposed to require that the method by which the actor recovers its costs must be\nreasonably related to the actor’s costs of providing the type of access, exchange, or use to, or\nat the request of, the person or entity to whom the fee is charged (84 FR 7539).\n\nWe also proposed that the costs must be reasonably allocated among all customers to\nwhom the technology or service is supplied, or for whom the technology is supported. A\nreasonable allocation of costs would require that the actor allocate its costs in accordance with\ncriteria that are reasonable and between only those customers that either cause the costs to be\nincurred or benefit from the associated supply or support of the technology (84 FR 7539).\n\nWe proposed that the exception would not apply if the method by which the actor\nrecovers its costs is based, in any part, on whether the requestor or other person is a\ncompetitor, potential competitor, or will be using the EHI in a way that facilitates competition\nwith the actor. The use of such criteria would be suspect because it suggests the fee the actor is\ncharging is not based on its reasonable costs to provide the services and may have the purpose\nor effect of excluding or creating impediments for competitors, business rivals, or other\npersons engaged in developing or enabling the use of interoperable technologies and services\n\n\n\n\n(84 FR 7539).\n\nLast, we stated that the method by which the actor recovers its costs must not be based\non the sales, profit, revenue, or other value that the requestor or other persons derive or may\nderive from the access to, exchange of, or use of EHI, including the secondary use of such\ninformation, that exceeds the actor’s reasonable costs for the access, exchange, or use of EHI\n(84 FR 7539).\n\nWe requested comment on the proposed conditions and other issues we should\nconsider in assessing whether the methodology by which an actor distributes costs and charges\nfees should be considered reasonable and necessary for purposes of the exception. In\nparticular, we noted that we were considering whether to introduce specific factors and\nmethods for assessing when profit will be reasonable. We requested comment on whether the\npro-competitive or efficiency-adding aspect of an actor’s approach to providing access,\nexchange, or use of EHI should be taken into account when assessing the reasonableness of\nprofits. We asked commenters to consider whether there are specific use cases for which\nactors’ profits should be limited or prohibited for purposes of meeting the exception (84 FR\n7539).\n\nWe also asked commenters to consider alternate approaches to the exception that\nwould also achieve the goal of allowing actors to recover certain types of costs that would\npromote innovation, competition and consumer welfare and that are unlikely to present\ninformation blocking concerns. In assessing other potential approaches to this exception, we\nencouraged commenters to contemplate such considerations as enforceability, potential burden\non the parties, and overall effectiveness in meeting the above stated goals (84 FR 7539).\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments regarding our proposed approach for cost\nrecovery and profits. Some commenters supported our proposed approach. A couple of\n\n\n\n\ncommenters recommended that we prohibit all profits under the exception to ensure that actors\ncannot continue rent-seeking and exclusionary pricing practices. Several commenters\nrequested clarification regarding the profits that would be allowed under the exception and\nexpressed concern that the regulation text does not clearly state that profits are allowed under\nthe exception. Several other commenters, primarily health IT developers, disagreed with the\nproposed cost recovery approach and limits on profits, expressing concern that ONC’s\nproposals will serve as a barrier to innovation, competition, and interoperability. Some\ncommenters stated that ONC’s proposals regarding fees and profits go beyond the\ncongressional intent in the Cures Act and questioned whether ONC has regulatory authority to\nregulate costs and profits.\n\nWe received some comments that recommended we take a different approach for\nassessing whether an actor’s costs recovered are reasonable. Commenters recommended using\nan approach that distinguishes, as appropriate, between: (1) pure cost or expense recovery,\nwith no provision for margin or profit; (2) “cost-based pricing” or “cost plus accounting,”\nwhere margin or profit is allowed; and (3) “market-based pricing,” where there are no\nrestrictions on pricing. A couple of commenters recommended that where a cost-based pricing\nmechanism is required, the method for assessing the cost basis should be reasonably\nassociated with the complexity or cost of providing the capabilities. Such methods could\ninclude reasonable heuristics, estimates, or other commonly used methods.\n\nCommenters recommended that we distinguish “basic access” (with no profits or\nlimited profits) from “value-added” access, exchange, or use (which would allow for increased\nprofits). A couple of commenters recommended that allowed fees for “basic access” be on a\npure direct cost recovery basis only. Those commenters recommended that the cost to develop\nand/or map to standards should not be part of the cost basis for fees for “basic access;” rather\n\n\n\n\nany such costs should be a part of the fees for the health IT. The commenters recommended\nthat when the outputs of value-added services are incorporated into, or from, an essential part\nof the legal medical record, or are routinely used for decision making, they constitute part of\nthe set to which basic access is required. The commenters also recommended that we\ndistinguish between intellectual property (IP) rights that are essential to access EHI and IP\nrights that allow for value-added services.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of our proposals and for the\nthoughtful comments on this aspect of the exception. We appreciate that commenters were\nconcerned both about the elimination of rent-seeking, opportunistic fees, and exclusionary\npricing practices that interfere with the access, exchange, and use of EHI as well as the\nimportance of finalizing policies that support and promote innovation. We have finalized the\nproposed approach for determining whether the basis for fees charged is acceptable under this\nexception, with some clarifications and updates detailed below.\n\nAs we discussed in the Proposed Rule, we believe our approach will provide actors\nthat seek to meet this exception certainty that charging fees to recover certain costs reasonably\nincurred for the access, exchange, or use of EHI will not implicate the information blocking\nprovision, provided the actor’s practice meets the conditions of the exception. We reiterate\nthat an actor who seeks to comply with the conditions of this exception will not be prevented\nfrom making a reasonable profit in connection with the access, exchange, or use of EHI,\nprovided that all applicable conditions are met. We emphasize that our intention with this\nexception is not to set any particular costs that would be considered “reasonably incurred,” but\nrather to allow the market to define the appropriate price so long as certain methods are\nfollowed and certain criteria are met as established by the conditions. To be responsive to\ncomments, we have added text in the introductory sentence of this exception that clarifies that\n\n\n\n\nfees that result in a reasonable profit margin will be covered by this exception so long as they\nare in compliance with the conditions in the exception (§ 171.302).\n\nWe also appreciate the comments that encouraged us to prohibit all profits under this\nexception. We considered this approach, but believe that actors should be able to make a\nreasonable profit margin, subject to the conditions in this exception. The allowance of a\nreasonable profit margin is necessary to incentivize innovation and allow innovators to earn\nreturns on the investments they have made to develop, maintain, and update innovations that\nultimately improve health care delivery and benefit patients. We believe the finalized\napproach strikes the appropriate balance of addressing the rent-seeking and exclusionary\npricing practices noted by the commenters while enabling and supporting innovation.\n\nHowever, to be responsive to these comments related to limiting profits, we added a provision\nin § 171.302(a)(1)(iv) that the fees an actor charges must be based on costs not otherwise\nrecovered for the same instance of service to a provider and third party. The intent of this\nprovision is that the exception will not apply to practices where an actor charges twice for the\nsame exact service. For example, the exception likely would not apply where an actor charges\na hospital for providing a third party that the hospital contracts with access to certain EHI, and\nthen charges that same third party an additional fee for access to the same EHI. This condition\ncreates a necessary guardrail to address potential misuse of this exception that could result in a\nwindfall for certain actors who charge fees for the same services multiple times.\n\nWe have also modified other aspects of this final rule that address commenter concerns\nregarding this exception. First, as discussed previously in this section and in more detail in\nsection VIII.C.3 of this preamble, we have focused the scope of the EHI definition. This\nchange addresses commenters’ concerns regarding potential ambiguity regarding the types of\ninformation for which profits could be realized. Actors seeking certainty about their practices\n\n\n\n\nrelated to charging fees only need to comply with this exception if their practices interfere\nwith the access, exchange, and use of EHI. We emphasize that we are not limiting the fees\nand/or profits related to the access, exchange, or use of information outside the scope of EHI.\n\nWe refer readers to section VIII.C.3 of this preamble for a detailed discussion of focused\nscope of the EHI definition.\n\nSecond, under the finalized information blocking definition, for up to 18 months after\nthe six-month delayed compliance date of the information blocking section of this final rule\n(part 171) (a total of 24 months after the publication date of this final rule), EHI for purposes\nof part 171 is limited to the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the USCDI\nstandard adopted in § 170.213 (see (§ 171.103(b)). The fees an actor charges during that time\nwill only be limited pursuant to the conditions in this exception for that subset of EHI.\n\nWe note that we revised § 171.302(a)(1)(i) for clarity by limiting the requirement to\n“objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied for all similarly situated classes of\npersons and requests” instead of “objective and verifiable criteria that are uniformly applied\nfor all substantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests.” We believe\nthe final standard achieves the same goal as the proposed standard and provides a clearer\ncondition for the regulated community to follow. We updated § 171.302(a)(2)(ii) by removing\nthe illustrative language regarding the “secondary use of such information” and by removing\nthe proposed language about exceeding the actor’s reasonable costs for providing access,\nexchange, or use of EHI (see 84 FR 7539). The provision finalized in § 171.302(a)(1)(ii)—\nthat an actor’s fees must be reasonably related to the actor’s costs of providing the type of\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI to, or at the request of, the person or entity to whom the fee is\ncharged—achieves the same purpose of limiting fees to those necessary to recover the costs\nreasonably incurred.\n\n\n\n\nWe removed the “secondary use” language because it seemed superfluous to include in\nthe regulation text; however, we emphasize that we maintain that the fees an actor charges\nmust not be based on the sales, profit, revenue or other value that the requestor or other\npersons derive or may derive from the subsequent use of EHI. Our policy on this point has not\nchanged from the Proposed Rule. Practices that use this method to recover costs will not\nbenefit from this exception and may implicate the information blocking provision. Last, we\nnote that we have added “or entities” to follow “person” to align with the language in §\n171.302(a)(1)(ii).\n\nWe note, with regard to the “basis for fees” and “excluded fees” conditions (§\n171.302(a) and (b), respectively), that each provision under these conditions was proposed in\nthe Proposed Rule with the exception of two new provisions: (1) the fees an actor charges\nmust be based on costs not otherwise recovered for the same instance of service to a provider\nand third party (§ 171.302(a)(1)(iv)); and (2) the fees an actor charges must not be based on\nany costs that led to the creation of IP, if the actor charged a royalty for that IP pursuant to §\n171.303 and that royalty included the development costs for the creation of the intellectual\nproperty (§ 171.302(a)(2)(vi)). We discuss each of these additions in the discussion below.\n\nRegarding the conditions that were included in the proposed exception, we note that some of\nthe conditions were in different subsections of the proposed exception and/or have been\nupdated for clarity and consistency with other sections of this final rule. We describe all the\nsubstantive changes to these provisions in this preamble, but refer readers to the proposed\nexception to review the full scope of structural changes and clarifications we have made (see\n84 FR 7603).\n\n*Comments.* We received some comments regarding the scaling of fees and the\nproposed condition that the method by which the actor recovers its costs must be reasonably\n\n\n\n\nallocated among all customers to whom the technology or service is supplied or for whom the\ntechnology is supported. Some commenters stated that the notion that costs can be evenly\ndivided among clients is flawed. Commenters requested that ONC allow a fee scale as\nopposed to a blanket fee structure. Commenters noted that a sliding scale structure would\nensure that smaller entities would not be limited by a restrictive pricing application that\nthreatens their operating costs, which may exist on a slim margin. A couple of commenters\nrequested that ONC recognize that for many organizations, especially non-profits, it is\ncommon and appropriate for fees to scale with the size of a member/participant organization.\n\nSeveral HIEs and HINs expressed concern that the proposed condition regarding the\nreasonable allocation of costs could have the unintended effect of prohibiting the fee structure\nof many public HIEs/HINs. Commenters noted that many HIEs/HINs choose to charge fees to\nonly a subset of their participants. However, as proposed, the condition that costs be\nreasonably allocated among all customers could undercut this ability. Commenters\nemphasized that the ability to offer free services to smaller providers, particularly as\nHIEs/HINs work to engage providers across the care continuum, is an important flexibility for\nsuch organizations. Commenters requested that HIE/HIN membership/participation costs and\nsubscription fees not be considered restricted fees under the information blocking provision.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments. We maintain that the\ncondition regarding reasonable allocation of costs in § 171.302(a)(iii) is necessary to ensure\nthat actors do not allocate fees in an arbitrary or anti-competitive manner. The final condition\nrequires that an actor allocate its costs in accordance with criteria that are reasonable and\nbetween only those customers that either cause the costs to be incurred or benefit from the\nassociated supply or support of the technology. We have finalized this condition with a\nmodification discussed below.\n\n\n\n\nWe agree with commenters that there may be situations when it would be reasonable\nfor an actor to allocate costs differently for different classes of customers. In response to these\ncomments, we have revised the condition in § 171.302(a)(1)(iii) so that the fees an actor\ncharges must be reasonably allocated among all similarly situated customers to whom the\ntechnology or service is supplied, or for whom the technology is supported. This addition\naddresses commenters’ concerns by providing actors with the discretion to allocate costs\ndifferently for different classes of customers, while ensuring that any differences in cost\nallocation are based on actual differences in the class of customer. For instance, under this\nprovision, fees must be reasonably allocated among all similarly situated large hospital\nsystems (above a certain established size threshold) to whom a technology or service is\nsupplied, or for whom the technology is supported. However, the allocation of fees for the\nsame technology or service could be quite different for a small, non-profit, rural health clinic.\n\nWe also note that we have replaced “customers” with “persons or entities” in §\n171.302(a)(1)(iii) in order to align the language with § 171.302(a)(1)(i) and (ii). We believe\naligning the provisions within § 171.302(a) will strengthen the exception and provide actor’s\nwith clarity regarding what is necessary to meet the exception.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments, primarily from providers and provider\norganizations, regarding the potential financial burden the proposed exception will place on\nactors. Commenters recommended that ONC carefully consider the downstream financial\nimpact of new requirements, especially that providers, including providers without certified\nhealth IT and who do not participate in CMS programs, will bear the brunt of the financial\nburden of these policies. More specifically, commenters expressed concern regarding potential\nrecordkeeping and administrative burden caused by this exception. Commenters explained\nthat actors may need to retain extensive records to document all of the costs that the actor\n\n\n\n\nincurred so that it can prove that its fees only constitute those costs plus a reasonable profit.\n\nFurther, commenters stated that the administrative burden required to assess and monitor this\nexception would be significant and not sustainable. Commenters explained that cost\naccounting is challenging for even very large and well-resourced organizations and there is\nconcern that the exception will result in unintended negative consequences for many actors.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. We reiterate that actors may choose to satisfy\nthe conditions of this exception to be certain that the fees they charge for the access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI do not implicate the information blocking provision. We also reiterate that failure to\nmeet the exception does not mean that an actor’s practice related to charging fees meets the\ninformation blocking definition. However, as we explained in the Proposed Rule, we interpret the\nbroad definition of information blocking in section 3022(a) of the PHSA to encompass any fee\nthat is likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI (84 FR 7521). Fees that do not\nmeet this exception may implicate the information blocking provision and will have to be\nassessed on a case-by-case basis to determine, for example, the actor’s intent and whether the\npractice rises to the level of an interference. This exception, as well as the other finalized\nexceptions, strike a balance by identifying, as the Cures Act requires, activities that interfere with\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI but which are reasonable and necessary.\n\nWe believe the overwhelming benefits of the information blocking provision and the\nexceptions to the information blocking definition—which enable patients to access, exchange,\nand use their EHI where and when it is needed—far outweigh the potential burden on actors.\n\nWe believe the revisions we have made to this exception, the addition of paragraph (b) in the\ninformation blocking definition (see § 171.103(b)) and the discussion in section VIII.C of this\npreamble), the addition of the Content and Manner Exception, as well as the revisions we have\nmade to the other exceptions and relevant terms will have the overall effect of reducing\n\n\n\n\nburden on actors. The fact the information blocking section of this rule (part 171) has a 6-\nmonth delayed compliance date from the publication date of this final rule will also relieve the\nburden on actors and give them time to prepare for administrative changes.\n\n*Comments.* We received comments about the interplay and potential overlap between\nthe proposed Fees Exception and Licensing Exception. Some commenters suggested that we\ncombine the two exceptions for clarity. Some commenters requested clarification as to\nwhether an actor may charge both a fee to recover reasonable costs associated with EHI\nservices and a reasonable royalty for licensing interoperability elements. One commenter\nexpressed concern that the overlap between the two exceptions creates the potential for actors\nto recover the same costs twice. The commenter explained that licensing of IP is intended to\nrecoup the costs of development of that IP, so where the IP is an interoperability element, the\ncosts reasonably incurred for its development should be incorporated into the royalty rate. The\ncommenter recommended that we should be clearer that, in these circumstances, only a single\nrecovery is permitted.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the thoughtful feedback and agree that the\ndistinction between the Fees Exception and the Licensing Exception (§ 171.303) must be\nclear. We emphasize that both exceptions deal with the fees actors may charge regarding the\naccess, exchange, or use of EHI and under both exceptions actors use interoperability\nelements (as defined in § 171.102) to facilitate the access, exchange, or use of EHI. The\nexception for recovering costs reasonably incurred enables actors to recover their costs to\ndevelop technologies and provide services that enhance interoperability. On the other hand,\nthe exception for licensing interoperability elements specifically addresses circumstances\nwhen it is necessary for an actor to license interoperability elements in order fulfill a request to\naccess exchange, or use EHI. The Licensing Exception deals with the requisite licensing\n\n\n\n\nconditions. We believe there should be a distinction made between these two exceptions, and\nhave therefore decided not to combine the two exceptions.\n\nWe agree with the commenter that actors should not be able to recover the same costs\ntwice and have added a provision in § 171.302(a)(2)(vi) that the fees an actor charges must not\nbe based on any costs that led to the creation of IP, if the actor charged a royalty for that IP\npursuant to § 171.303 and that royalty included the development costs for the creation of the\nintellectual property.\n\nExcluded Fees Condition\nWe proposed that certain costs should be explicitly excluded from the exception\nregardless of the method for recovering the costs (84 FR 7540).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments regarding the overall proposed approach of\nexcluding certain costs from this exception.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the structure of this exception to exclude certain fees\nwith the changes described in the discussions above and below. We note that we have\nsubstituted the “or” that preceded the final excluded fee in the proposed exception (see 84 FR\n7603) with an “and” in the final exception. This is not a substantive change, as our intent has\nalways been that the exception does not apply to each of “excluded fees.” This revision\nclarifies that point.\n\nCosts Due to Non-standard Design or Implementation Choices\nWe proposed that this exception would not permit the recovery of any cost that the\nactor incurred due to the health IT being designed or implemented in non-standard ways that\nunnecessarily increase the complexity, difficulty or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using\nEHI. To the extent that such costs can be reasonably avoided, we stated that we believe that\nactors should internalize the costs of such behaviors, which do not benefit consumers, and\n\n\n\n\nwhich create unnecessary impediments to access, exchange, and use of EHI. We requested\ncomments on the proposed exclusion of these types of costs from the exception (84 FR 7540).\n\n*Comments.* We received several comments regarding the proposed exclusion of costs\ndue to non-standard design or implementation choices from this exception. A couple of\ncommenters expressed support for the proposal. A couple of other commenters disagreed with\nthe proposal and recommended that actors should be able to recover all reasonable\nimplementation costs independent of design decisions. One commenter requested additional\nclarity about what “non-standard” means. A couple of commenters noted that requestors may\nprefer information in a non-standard manner to meet their business purposes, due to their own\nconstraints, or for other reasons.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support of this proposal, as well as the\nconstructive feedback. We emphasize that the problematic nature of non-standard\nimplementation choices was identified by Congress in the Cures Act. Section 3022(a)(2)(B) of\nthe PHSA states that information blocking may include implementing health IT in non-\nstandard ways that are likely to substantially increase the complexity or burden of accessing,\nexchanging, or using EHI. Due to Congress’s clear objective to restrict these practices, along\nwith our continued concern that these practices will lead to unnecessary complexity and\nburden related to the access, exchange, or use of EHI, we have finalized the proposed\nprovision regarding non-standard design and implementation choices. We have updated §\n171.302(a)(2)(iii) to address comments indicating that requestors may prefer information in a\nnon-standard manner to meet their business purposes, due to their own constraints, or for other\nreasons. We agree with commenters that in those situations—when the requestor requests\naccess, exchange or use of EHI in the non-standard way—the exception should allow the actor\nto charge fees for the reasonable costs associated with the requested non-standard design or\n\n\n\n\nimplementation. We emphasize, however, and make clear in § 171.302(a)(2)(iii), that such\nfees related to non-standard design or implementation are only covered by the exception when\nthe requestor agreed to the fee associated with the non-standard design or implementation to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI. We note that this provision was proposed as an “excluded cost”\nbut has been finalized within the “Basis for fees condition” for clarity and to align with the\nrevised structure of this exception.\n\nWe also note that the new Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301 further\naddresses commenter concerns because it provides actors with clear procedures regarding the\nmanner in which they may provide access, exchange, or use of EHI if they are technically\nunable to respond in the manner requested or the manner requested requires the actor to\nlicense intellectual property and the actor cannot reach agreeable terms with the requestor\n(discussed in section VIII.D.2.a of this preamble). If an actor meets that exception, its practice\nwould not implicate the information blocking provision. For instance, if a requestor requested\nthat the actor provide EHI in a non-standard manner, but the actor is technically unable to\nprovide the EHI in the manner requested, the actor’s response to the request would not\nimplicate the information blocking provision if it provides the EHI via an alternative manner\nin accordance with § 171.301(b). The actor could also potentially seek coverage under the\nInfeasibility Exception if the request is infeasible and the actor meets all the conditions in §\n171.204.\n\nRegarding the comment concerning additional clarity about what “non-standard”\nmeans, we explained and provided examples in the Proposed Rule of practices related to\nimplementing health IT in non-standard ways that substantially increase the complexity or\nburden of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI, and therefore implicate the information\nblocking provision (84 FR 7521). In addition, the Cures Act specifically describes information\n\n\n\n\nblocking practices to include implementing health IT in nonstandard ways that are likely to\nsubstantially increase the complexity or burden of accessing, exchanging, or using electronic\nhealth information (see section 3022(a)(2)(B) of the PHSA). Therefore, the Proposed Rule\ndiscussion regarding non-standard ways of implementing health IT also applies for purposes\nof the Fees Exception. As explained in the Proposed Rule, non-standard implementation of\nhealth IT may arise where an actor chooses not to adopt, or to materially deviates from,\nrelevant standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria adopted by the\nSecretary under section 3004 of the PHSA (84 FR 7521). Even where no federally adopted or\nidentified standard exists, if a particular implementation approach has been broadly adopted in\na relevant industry segment, deviations from that approach will be suspect unless strictly\nnecessary to achieve substantial efficiencies. For further discussion regarding our rationale for\nthis provision, as well as specific, non-exhaustive examples of conduct that would be likely to\ninterfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI, we refer readers to the Proposed Rule (84\nFR 7521).\n\nSubjective or Speculative Costs\nWe proposed to limit this exception to the recovery of costs that an actor actually\nincurred to provide the relevant interoperability element or group of elements (which may\ncomprise either products or services). We proposed that the exception would not permit the\nrecovery of certain types of costs that are subjective or speculative. We noted two important\nexamples of this limitation. First, we proposed that an actor would not be permitted to recover\nany costs associated with intangible assets (including depreciation or loss of value), other than\nthe actual development or acquisition costs of such assets. For example, an actor could not\ncharge a customer a fee based on the purported “cost” of allowing the customer to use the\nactor’s patented technology, computer software, databases, trade secrets, copyrighted works,\n\n\n\n\nand the like. We noted that the customer’s use of the asset could be considered a “cost” in the\nsense that, were it not for the information blocking provision, the actor could charge a royalty\nor other fee for the use of its intangible assets. For this reason we proposed to permit an actor\nto license most interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, subject\nto certain conditions. For purposes of this more general exception, however, we explained that\nit would be inappropriate to permit an actor to charge a fee based on these considerations,\nwhich are inherently subjective and could invite the kinds of rent-seeking and opportunistic\npricing practices that fall squarely within the definition of information blocking. We proposed\nthat an actor’s practices could qualify for both this exception (Fees Exception) and the\nLicensing Exception (finalized in § 171.303). In that case, the actor could recover costs under\nboth exceptions (84 FR 7540).\n\nSecond we stated the exception would not apply to “opportunity costs,” such as the\nrevenues that an actor could have earned had it not provided the interoperability elements. We\nclarified that the exclusion of opportunity costs would not preclude an actor from recovering\nits reasonable forward-looking cost of capital (84 FR 7540).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on our proposals regarding subjective or\nspeculative costs.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized this provision as proposed with some modifications for\nclarity. We have modified the provision regarding intangible assets in § 171.301(a)(2)(iv) by\nremoving the parenthetical that noted that such costs include the depreciation or loss of value.\n\nThe parenthetical was illustrative and was not necessary in the regulation text, as it is just one\nof the many types of intangible assets on which a fee must not be based. We have also\nmodified the provision regarding opportunity costs in § 171.301(a)(2)(v) by clarifying that the\nspecific opportunity costs on which a fee must not be based are those unrelated to the access,\n\n\n\n\nexchange, or use of EHI instead of the proposed qualifying language of “except for the\nreasonable forward-looking cost of capital” (see 84 FR 7603). We believe this finalized\nlanguage is clearer than the proposed language. In addition, it is more precise than the\nproposed language because it creates a connection to the information blocking definition. We\nnote that we proposed these provisions as “excluded costs” (see 84 FR 7603) but have\nfinalized them within the “Basis for fees condition” for clarity.\n\nFee Prohibited by 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)\nWe also proposed that the exception would not apply to fees prohibited by 45 CFR\n164.524(c)(4). We noted in the Proposed Rule that the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits a covered\nentity to impose a reasonable, cost-based fee if the individual requests a copy of the PHI (or\nagrees to receive a summary or explanation of the information). The fee may include only the\ncost of: (1) labor for copying the PHI requested by the individual, whether in paper or\nelectronic form; (2) supplies for creating the paper copy or electronic media (e.g., CD or USB\ndrive) if the individual requests that the electronic copy be provided on portable media; (3)\npostage, when the individual requests that the copy, or the summary or explanation, be mailed;\nand (4) preparation of an explanation or summary of the PHI, if agreed to by the individual\n(45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)). The fee may not include costs associated with verification;\ndocumentation; searching for and retrieving the PHI; maintaining systems; recouping capital\nfor data access, storage, or infrastructure; or other costs not listed above even if such costs are\nauthorized by State law (84 FR 7540).\n\n*Comments.* We received a couple of comments regarding copying fees allowed under\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule. One commenter stated that reasonable, cost-based fees for certain\ncosts, consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule individual access provisions, should not be\nallowed under the exception. One commenter requested that ONC harmonize the exception\n\n\n\n\nwith the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions that govern the charging of fees for electronic copies\nof medical records.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. We have decided to finalize the provision\nas proposed, which harmonizes this part of the exception (§ 171.302) with those provisions of\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule. The exception does not apply to fees prohibited by 45 CFR\n164.524(c)(4). Consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s individual access fee\nimplementation specification, an actor can charge a reasonable, cost-based fee related to\ncertain costs (described above) if a patient requests a copy of her records.\n\nIndividual Electronic Access\nWe proposed that the exception would not apply if the actor charged a fee based in any\npart on the electronic access by an individual or their personal representative, agent, or\ndesignee to the individual’s EHI. We stated that such fees are distinguished from the cost-\nbased fees that a covered entity is permitted to charge individuals for the provision of copies\nof ePHI under the HIPAA Privacy Rule access provisions (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)), and similar\nallowable costs under State privacy laws, which would not be excluded from the costs\nrecoverable under the exception. We clarified that access to EHI that is provisioned by\nsupplying some form of physical media, such as paper copies (where the EHI is printed out),\nor where EHI is copied onto a CD or flash-drive, would not be a practice that implicated the\ninformation blocking provision provided that the fee(s) charged for that access complied with\nthe HIPAA Privacy Rule access provisions (45 CFR 164.524(c)(4)) (84 FR 7540).\n\nWe stated that a fee based on electronic access by an individual or their personal\nrepresentative, agent, or designee to the individual’s EHI, in contrast, would arise if an actor\nsought to impose on individuals, or their personal representatives, agents, or designees, a fee\nthat operated as a toll to electronically access, exchange, or use EHI. For example, a health\n\n\n\n\ncare provider that charges individuals a fee in order for the individuals to receive access to\ntheir EHI via the health care provider’s patient portal or another internet-based method, would\nnot be able to benefit from this exception. Similarly, where an individual authorizes\n(approves) a consumer-facing app to receive EHI on the individual’s behalf, the exception\nwould not apply to practices where an actor charges the app or its developer a fee to access or\nuse APIs that enable an individual’s access to the individual’s EHI. We explained that this\nwould be true whether the actor is a supplier of the API technology or an individual or entity\nthat has deployed the API technology, such as a health care provider (84 FR 7540).\n\n*Comments.* Commenters expressed overwhelming support for our proposal regarding\nindividual electronic access. Commenters from across stakeholder groups emphasized that\npatients have a fundamental right to access their data and should be able to access, exchange,\nand use their EHI at no charge. Commenters emphasized that the EHI belongs to the patient,\nand neither health care providers, EHR developers, nor payers should profit from the sale of\nEHI, as that will only serve to limit data transfer, increase health care costs, and adversely\naffect patient care.\n\nCommenters strongly supported our proposal (within the API Condition of\nCertification) that API fees should not be a barrier in allowing patient access to their EHI (see\nproposed § 170.404 and 84 FR 7487 through 7491). They stressed that neither individuals nor\napp developers (i.e., API Users) should be charged a fee for API uses that are associated with\nthe access, exchange, and use of EHI by patients or their applications, technologies, or\nservices. Several commenters supported our efforts to bolster patient access, noting that the\ncapacity to offer a patient access to EHI, through an API, without cost, is well-supported in the\nProposed Rule. One commenter requested that we differentiate between an individual\nelectronically accessing EHI and third parties, at the direction of the individual, electronically\n\n\n\n\naccessing EHI.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for the support and have finalized this provision as\nproposed with a slight modification to the text in § 171.302(b)(2) and clarification of the\nmeaning of electronic access, which we have codified in § 171.302(d). We have reordered the\nlanguage for clarity and, in order to clarify the terms “agent” and “designee,” we have\nreplaced them with “another person or entity designated by the individual.” These other\nindividuals or entities (e.g., a third-party app) receive access to EHI at the direction of the\nindividual and individuals control whether the third-party receives access to the individual’s\nEHI. This modification is merely a clarification of our proposal and is not a substantive\nchange as we clearly stated in the Proposed Rule that, as summarized above, this exception\nwould not apply to practices where an actor charges the app or its developer a fee to access or\nuse APIs that enable access to the individual’s EHI. Fees can be a method of interfering with\nthe access, exchange, and use of EHI, as we have emphasized in the Proposed Rule and this\nfinal rule. When it comes to an individual’s electronic access to their EHI, we believe that any\nfee, whether direct or indirectly passed on through a fee charged to a third-party app that the\nindividual has chosen to facilitate access to their EHI, could interfere with an individual’s\naccess and use of their EHI. ONC’s implementation of the Cures Act is predicated on an\nunderstanding that access to EHI should not be treated as a commodity that should be traded\nor sold. ONC takes this approach because we view patients as having an overwhelming\ninterest in EHI about themselves, and because we understand that the true value of EHI can\nonly be realized if it is available where and when it is needed, including providing electronic\naccess to patients. Patients have already effectively paid for their health information, either\ndirectly or through their employers, health plans, and other entities that negotiate and purchase\nhealth care items and services on their behalf. We have codified this provision in §\n\n\n\n\n170.302(b)(2) to not permit “[a] fee based in any part on the electronic access of an\nindividual’s EHI by the individual, their personal representative, or another person or entity\ndesignated by the individual.”\n\nFor purposes of the Fees Exception, we define electronic access to mean an internet-based\nmethod that makes EHI available at the time the EHI is requested and where no manual effort is\nrequired to fulfill the request (§ 171.302(d)). We discussed the meaning of “electronic access” in\nthe Proposed Rule (see 45 FR 7540). We have defined “electronic access” in § 171.302(d) in this\nfinal rule consistent with the Proposed Rule, including distinguishing it from the methods and\nefforts we cited in the Proposed Rule that we did not consider electronic access and for which a\nfee could be charged (see 45 FR 7540). We have chosen “internet-based method” in lieu of the\nproposed “web-based delivery” because it more technically aligns with the concept we were\nattempting to convey in the Proposed Rule. Such methods would be, as described in part in the\nProposed Rule, access via an API, patient portal, or other internet-based means. To note, the\n2015 Edition “view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty” certification criterion uses this same\nconcept of “internet-based” to convey that “patients (and their authorized representatives) must\nbe able to use internet-based technology to view, download, and transmit….” In terms of\nfulfilling a request without manual effort, we clarify that it entails the completion of the process\nwhere there is no manual effort involved to meet the request at the time of the request. To\nillustrate the inverse, we recognize that there are times that manual effort may be involved in\ncollating or assembling EHI from various systems in response to a request. In such instances, this\nprovision (§ 170.302(b)(2)) would not apply to the costs of those efforts because the efforts\nwould not fall under the definition of “electronic access.”\n\nWe reaffirm that this exception would not apply to an actor that charges individuals a\nfee in order for the individuals to receive access to their EHI using an internet-based delivery\n\n\n\n\nmethod, including where an individual uses consumer-directed technology (e.g., patient-\nchosen apps, personal health apps, standalone/untethered personal health records (PHR),\nemail) to request and/or receive their EHI. This includes sharing it with an entity designated\nby the individual (e.g., allowing individuals to donate/share EHI with a biomedical research\nprogram of the individual’s choice). Practices that involve an actor charging an individual (or\nthe individual’s personal representative or another person or entity designated by the\nindividual) a fee to access, exchange, or use their EHI would be inherently suspect and would\nbe extremely likely to implicate the information blocking provision. We emphasize that\npractices that do not meet this condition, or any other conditions in the Fees Exception, would\nbe subject to case-by-case review (unless another exception applies). We further refer readers\nto our discussion of “interfere with” or “interference,” including examples of practices that\nwould likely interfere with access, exchange, and use of EHI (section VIII.C.6).\n\nExport and Portability of EHI Maintained in EHR Systems\nWe explained in the Proposed Rule that the definition of information blocking\nspecifically mentions transitions between health IT systems and the export of complete\ninformation sets as protected forms of access, exchange, and use (see section 3022(a)(2)(C)(i)\nof the PHSA). We noted that in our experience, health care providers frequently encounter\nrent-seeking and opportunistic pricing practices in these and other contexts in which they are\nattempting to export EHI from their systems for use in connection with other technologies or\nservices that compete with or could reduce the revenue opportunities associated with an EHR\ndeveloper’s own suite of products and services. We explained that most EHI is currently\nmaintained in EHRs and other source systems that use proprietary data models or formats; this\nputs EHR developers in a unique position to block the export and portability of EHI for use in\ncompeting systems or applications, or to charge rents for access to the basic technical\n\n\n\n\ninformation needed to facilitate the conversion or migration of data for these purposes. We\nemphasized that our concerns are compounded by the fact that EHR developers rarely disclose\nin advance the fees they will charge for data export and data portability services (see 80 FR\n62719; 80 FR 16880 and 81).\n\nFor these reasons, we proposed that fees charged for the export, conversion, or\nmigration of data from an EHR technology would not qualify for this exception unless they\nalso meet two additional conditions. First, we proposed that health IT developers of certified\nhealth IT would, for purposes of the exception, be precluded from charging a fee to perform\nan export of EHI via the capability of health IT certified to the proposed 2015 Edition “EHI\nexport” certification criterion for the purposes of supporting single patient EHI export upon a\nvalid request from that patient or a user on the patient’s behalf, or supporting the export of all\nEHI when health care provider chooses to transition or migrate information to another health\nIT system. We stated that, as part of the “Assurances” Condition of Certification, health IT\ndevelopers that produce and electronically manage EHI would need to be certified to the\ncriterion and provide the functionality to its customers. We stated that fees or limitations\nassociated with the use of the “EHI export” certification criterion (as distinguished from\ndeployment or other costs reasonably incurred by the developer) would not receive protection\nunder the exception and may be suspect under the information blocking provision (84 FR\n7541).\n\nWe clarified that the condition would not preclude a developer from charging a fee to\ndeploy the “EHI export” certification criterion in a health care provider’s production\nenvironment, or to provide additional services in connection with this capability other than\nthose reasonably necessary to enable its intended use. For example, we explained that this\ncondition would not preclude a developer from charging a fee to perform an export of EHI via\n\n\n\n\nthe capability of health IT certified to the proposed § 170.315(b)(10) for a third-party analytics\ncompany. We noted in the Proposed Rule that, because the certification criterion provides\nonly a baseline capability for exporting data, we anticipated that health IT developers of\ncertified health IT will need to provide other data portability services to facilitate the smooth\ntransition of health care providers between different health IT systems. We proposed that such\nfees may qualify for protection under the exception, but only if they meet the other conditions\ndescribed above and in proposed § 171.205(a).\n\nSecond, we proposed that the exception would not apply to a fee to export or convert\ndata from an EHR technology unless such fee was agreed to in writing at the time the\ntechnology was acquired, meaning when the EHR developer and the customer entered into a\ncontract or license agreement for the EHR technology (84 FR 7541).\n\n*Comments.* A commenter requested clarification regarding the proposal to exclude\nfrom the exception costs related to fees to export or convert data from an EHR technology,\nunless such fee was agreed to in writing at the time the technology was acquired. The\ncommenter asked that ONC clarify if this provision is applicable to export or the conversion\nof EHI from certified health IT or if it is applicable to any export or conversion of EHI from\nany health IT. The commenter also requested that ONC clarify if this provision is prospective\nin nature, meaning it would only apply to agreements entered into after the effective date of a\nfinal rule. The commenter recommended that ONC change the focus of this proposal so that it\nonly requires that the parties agree in writing that fees of a particular nature may be charged\nfor the export of EHI.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment. In response to the comment, we clarify that\nthis exclusion from the exception is not limited to the export of EHI from certified health IT.\n\nInstead, this provision applies to the export or conversion of any EHI from an actor’s\n\n\n\n\ntechnology(ies). As we discuss elsewhere in this Final Rule, we interpret the information\nblocking provision broadly such that practices of a health IT developer of certified health IT\nthat do not pertain specifically to certified health IT may implicate the information blocking\nprovision. Consistent with this interpretation of the information blocking provision, the\nexception will not protect practices where an actor charges fees to export or convert data from\nany EHR technology, unless such fee was agreed to in writing at the time technology was\nacquired. Further, we clarify that if a fee to export or convert data is not subject to this\nexclusion in § 171.302(b)(4) because it was agreed to in writing, it still must meet the other\napplicable conditions in § 171.302 to be covered by the Fees Exception.\n\nWithout this exclusion, actors may seek to take advantage of the exception and enable\nrent-seeking or opportunistic pricing practices. Thus, we have decided not to limit the\ncondition so that it only requires that the parties agree in writing that fees of a particular nature\nmay be charged for the export of EHI as suggested by the commenter. Only requiring the\nparties to agree to the fee in writing (without applying the other conditions in this exception),\nmay allow an actor to charge an unreasonable fee or engage in a practice that is likely to\ninterfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI. While a party may agree to pay a fee under\nspecific circumstances, that agreement does not change the fact that the fee must be\nreasonably related to the actor’s costs or may otherwise interfere with the access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI.\n\nWe have finalized these provisions as proposed with a slight modification. We\nchanged the condition from “A fee to export or convert data from an EHR technology, unless\nsuch fee was agreed to in writing at the time the technology was acquired” (see 84 FR 7603)\nto “A fee to export or convert data from an EHR technology that was not agreed to in writing\nat the time the technology was acquired” (§ 171.302(b)(4)). We made this change for clarity\n\n\n\n\nbased on the change we made to the introductory language in the exception, that a practice\nwill not be considered information blocking when the practice meets the conditions in\nparagraph (a), does not include any of the excluded fees in paragraph (b), and, as applicable,\nmeets the condition in paragraph (c). This modification does not change the substance of this\ncondition in any way.\n\nCompliance with the Conditions of Certification\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that health IT developers of certified health IT subject\nto the API Condition of Certification may not charge certain types of fees and are subject to\nmore specific cost accountability provisions than apply generally under this proposed\nexception. We noted that the failure of developers to comply with these additional\nrequirements would impose impediments to consumer and other stakeholder access to EHI\nwithout special effort and would be suspect under the information blocking provision. We\nproposed, therefore, that a health IT developer of certified health IT subject to the API\nCondition of Certification must comply with all requirements of that condition for all practices\nand at all relevant times in order to qualify for the exception (84 FR 7541).\n\nWe also stated that a health care provider that acts as an API Data Provider should be\nsubject to the same constraints. We noted that the API Condition of Certification prohibits a\nhealth IT developer from charging a usage fee to patient-oriented apps. We noted that\ninformation blocking concerns would arise if a provider were to charge such a fee,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the provider is not subject to the certification requirements. For\nthis reason, we proposed that, if the actor is an API Data Provider, the actor would only be\npermitted to charge the same fees that an API Technology Supplier would be permitted to\ncharge to recover costs consistent with the permitted fees specified in the Condition of\nCertification (84 FR 7541).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments on these proposals.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the first provision detailed above as proposed with a\nslight modification for clarity. The final provision in § 171.302(c) states: Notwithstanding any\nother provision of this exception, if the actor is a health IT developer subject to the Conditions\nof Certification in § 170.402(a)(4), § 170.404, or both of this subchapter, the actor must\ncomply with all requirements of such conditions for all practices and at all relevant times. We\nadded “or both” into the final language because a health IT developer could be subject to both\n§ 170.402(a)(4) and § 170.404 and in such instances would be covered by this provision.\n\nWe have removed the second provision detailed above regarding a health care provider\nthat acts as an API Data Provider (see the Proposed Rule at 84 FR 7603) for clarity, as not all\nof the permitted fees specified in the API Condition of Certification (§ 170.404) are applicable\nfor API Data Providers.\n\nApplication of the Exception to Individual Practices\nWe stated in the Proposed Rule that the conditions of this exception, including those\ngoverning the methodology and criteria by which an actor calculates and distributes its costs,\nmust be satisfied for each and every fee that an actor charges to a customer, requestor, or other\nperson for accessing, exchanging, or using EHI. All applicable conditions of the exception\nmust be met at all relevant times for each practice (84 FR 7541).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on this proposed policy.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized this policy as proposed.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed in the Proposed Rule in § 171.206 to establish an exception to the\n\n\n\n\ninformation blocking provision that would permit actors to license interoperability elements\non reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms, provided that certain conditions are\nmet. We proposed that the information blocking provision would be implicated if an actor\nwere to refuse to license or allow the disclosure of interoperability elements to persons who\nrequire those elements to develop and provide interoperable technologies or services—\nincluding those that might complement or compete with the actor’s own technology or\nservices (84 FR 7544). Moreover, we proposed that the information blocking provision would\nbe implicated if the actor licensed such interoperability elements subject to terms or conditions\nthat have the purpose or effect of excluding or discouraging competitors, rivals, or other\npersons from engaging in these pro-competitive and interoperability-enhancing activities.\n\nThus, we proposed the Licensing Exception would apply in both vertical and horizontal\nrelationships and provided an example emphasizing that point in the Proposed Rule (see 84\nFR 7544).\n\nWe noted in the Proposed Rule that some licensees do not require interoperability\nelements to develop products or services that can be interoperable with the actor’s health IT.\n\nWe explained that there may be firms that simply want to license the actor’s technology for\nuse in developing their own interoperability elements. Their interest would be for access to the\ntechnology itself – not for the use of the technology to interoperate with either the actor or its\ncustomers to enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI. We emphasized that in such cases,\nthe actor’s licensing of its intellectual property (IP) in such a context would not implicate the\ninformation blocking provision (in other words, would not be in scope for information\nblocking). For a non-exhaustive list of examples of situations that would implicate the\ninformation blocking provision, see the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7544-45).\n\nIn our experience, contractual and IP rights are frequently used to extract unreasonable\n\n\n\n\nrents for access to EHI or to prevent competition from developers of interoperable\ntechnologies and services. These practices frustrate access, exchange, and use of EHI and\nstifle competition and innovation in the health IT sector. As a case in point, we noted in the\nProposed Rule that even following the enactment of the Cures Act, some health IT developers\nhad been selectively prohibiting—whether expressly or through commercially unreasonable\nterms—the disclosure or use of technical interoperability information required for third-party\napplications to access, exchange, and use EHI maintained in EHR systems. We noted that\nsuch practices limit health care providers’ use of the EHI maintained on their behalf to the\nparticular capabilities and use cases that their EHR developer happens to support. More than\nthis, by limiting the ability of providers to choose what applications and technologies they can\nuse with their EHR systems, we indicated that these practices close off the market to\ninnovative applications and services that providers and other stakeholders need to deliver\ngreater value and choice to health care purchasers and consumers (84 FR 7545).\n\nDespite these serious concerns, we recognized in the Proposed Rule that the definition\nof information blocking may be broader than necessary and could have unintended\nconsequences. We proposed that it is generally appropriate for actors to license their IP on\nRAND terms that do not interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI provided certain\nconditions were met. We explained that these practices would further the goals of the\ninformation blocking provision by allowing actors to protect the value of their innovations and\nearn returns on the investments made to develop, maintain, and update those innovations. We\nexplained that this would protect future incentives to invest in, develop, and disseminate\ninteroperable technologies and services. Conversely, we explained that if actors cannot (or\nbelieve they cannot) protect and commercialize their innovations, they may not engage in\nthese productive activities that improve access, exchange, and use of EHI (84 FR 7545).\n\n\n\n\nWe proposed that the exception would be subject to strict conditions to ensure, among\nother things, that actors license interoperability elements on RAND terms and that actors do\nnot impose collateral terms or engage in other practices that would impede the use of the\ninteroperability elements or otherwise undermine the intent of the exception (84 FR 7545). We\nacknowledged that preventing IP holders from extracting rents for access to EHI may differ\nfrom standard IP policy. We proposed that absent specific circumstances, IP holders are\ngenerally free to negotiate with prospective licensees to determine the royalty to practice their\nIP, and this negotiated royalty frequently reflects the value the licensee would obtain from\nexercising those rights. However, in the context of EHI, we proposed that a limitation on rents\nis essential due to the likelihood that rents will frustrate access, exchange, and use of EHI,\nparticularly because of the power dynamics that exist in the health IT market (84 FR 7545).\n\nWe also emphasized that actors are not required to seek the protection under this (or\nany other) exception. We explained that if an actor does not want to license a particular\ntechnology in accordance with the exception, it may choose to comply with the information\nblocking provision in another way, such as by developing and providing alternative means of\naccessing, exchanging, and using EHI that are similarly efficient and efficacious (84 FR\n7545).\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments in support of this proposed exception. One\ncommenter highlighted the significance of the exception, noting that data is often locked in\nproprietary software systems, at times preventing providers from being able to connect and\nexchange information. Some commenters requested additional examples and that ONC issue\nguidance to assist actors in understanding how they can determine whether a request to license\nis valid, when this exception would apply, and what steps actors would be required to take to\nattain coverage under the exception. A couple of commenters suggested that there should be a\n\n\n\n\ndistinction between requests to license interoperability elements to facilitate a patient’s\ntreatment or individual access versus requests that are simply for the requestor’s own business\npurposes, such as commercializing a competing product. A couple of commenters requested\nadditional provisions in the final rule to improve transparency regarding licensing of\ninteroperability elements. Commenters recommended that ONC require regulated actors who\nengage in RAND licensing of interoperability elements to publish either standard licensing\nrate offers or actual licenses.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their support for this exception as well as the\nconstructive feedback. We may consider developing materials in the future regarding the\napplication of the exceptions should the need arise. However, we believe the final rule clearly\ndescribes the conditions actors must meet in order to be covered by each exception, and\ninformational materials are not necessary at this time.\n\nWe appreciate the comments that recommended that there should be a distinction\nbetween requests for licensing of interoperability elements to facilitate a patient’s treatment or\nindividual access versus requests that are simply for the requestor’s own business purposes.\n\nWe emphasize that we made such a distinction in the Proposed Rule and we reiterate that\ndistinction here in the final rule. In order for an actor to consider licensing its interoperability\nelements under this exception, the requestor would need to have a claim to the underlying,\nexisting EHI for which the interoperability element would be necessary for access, exchange,\nor use (see the Privacy Exception discussion in VIII.D.1.b). An actor will not implicate the\ninformation blocking provision and does not need to seek coverage under this exception in\ncircumstances where the entity requesting to license or use the interoperability element is not\nseeking to use the interoperability element to interoperate with either the actor or the actor’s\ncustomers in order for EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used. For instance, an actor would\n\n\n\n\nnot need to consider licensing its interoperability elements in accordance with this exception\nto a firm that requested a license solely for that firm’s use in developing its own technologies\nor business when no EHI is sought to be accessed, exchanged, or used. In other words, if there\nis no nexus between a requestor’s need to license an interoperability element and existing EHI\non one or more patients, an actor does not need to consider licensing the interoperability\nelement requested in accordance with this exception. For example, if a developer of certified\nhealth IT included proprietary APIs in its product to support referral management, it would\nnot need to license the interoperability element(s) associated with those referral management\nAPIs simply because a requestor “knocked on the actor’s door” and asked for a license with\nno EHI involved. The license request from a requestor must always be based on a need to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI at the time the request is made – not on the requestor’s\nprospective intent to access, exchange, or use EHI at some point in the future.\n\nWe appreciate the recommendation that ONC should require regulated actors who\nlicense interoperability elements to publish either standard licensing rate offers or actual\nlicenses. However, we have decided not to finalize such a requirement because we believe\nactors should have discretion to decide whether to publish their licensing rates and/or licenses.\n\nWe believe this exception will still effectively regulate the licensing of interoperability\nelements even if it does not require the publication of such rates and licenses. Nonetheless, we\ncommend commenters’ desire to enhance transparency in the final rule and will continue to\nconsider steps to further promote transparency regarding our information blocking policies in\nfuture rulemakings.\n\nWe note that we have changed the title of this exception from “Exception—Licensing\nof interoperability elements on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms” to “When will an\nactor’s practice to license interoperability elements in order for electronic health information\n\n\n\n\nto be accessed, exchanged, or used not be considered information blocking?” Throughout this\nfinal rule preamble, we use “Licensing Exception” as a short form of this title, for ease of\nreference. As stated in Section VIII.D of this final rule preamble, we have changed the titles of\nall of the exceptions to questions to improve clarity. We have also edited the wording of the\nintroductory text in § 171.303, in comparison to that proposed (84 FR 7602), so that it is\nconsistent with the finalized title in § 171.303. We believe these conforming changes in\nwording of the introductory text also improve clarity in this section.\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments requesting greater clarity and precision\nregarding key terms within the proposed exception in order to clarify the scope and\napplication of the exception.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments and agree with commenters that it is\nessential that our final policies are clear, administrable, and actionable. Accordingly, we have\nmade several updates to this exception as well as to terms and concepts that apply broadly\nthroughout the information blocking section. Notably, we have: (1) revised the definition of\ninteroperability element (see section VIII.C.3.b); (2) clarified the process and timeframe for\nnegotiating a license (see the discussion later in this section of the preamble); (3) removed the\n“RAND” framework, which commenters noted was confusing (see the discussion later in this\nsection of the preamble); and (4) clarified the relationship between this exception and the Fees\nException (see § 171.302 and the discussion later in this section of the preamble).\n\n*Comments.* A few commenters requested clarification regarding whether the\ninformation blocking provision, and particularly this exception, applies to all licensing\nagreements already in effect; only licensing agreements that were entered into following the\neffective date of the Cures Act; or only those licensing agreements entered into after the\neffective date of ONC’s final rule. Commenters recommended that licensing agreements that\n\n\n\n\nwere entered into prior to the effective date of the final rule should be considered valid and\neffective. Commenters also recommended that all negotiations and licensing agreements\nentered into after the effective date of ONC’s final rule should comply with the requirements\nof the final rule. Commenters requested that if ONC plans to enforce provisions of the final\nrule retroactively, ONC should allow actors to review and renegotiate licensing agreements\nfor compliance with the terms at the request of the licensee.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these comments. We emphasize that actors are\nexpected to be in full compliance with the information blocking provision when this rule\nbecomes effective. We note that the information blocking section of this final rule (part 171)\nwill not become effective until 6 months after the publication date of the final rule. We believe\nthis delayed compliance date will provide actors with adequate time to assess their existing\nlicensing contracts or agreements and make appropriate changes and amendments to comply\nwith this final rule.\n\nOIG and ONC are coordinating timing of the compliance date of the information blocking\nsection of this final rule (45 CFR part 171) and the start of information blocking enforcement. We\nare providing the following information on timing for actors. Enforcement of information\nblocking CMPs in section 3022(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA will not begin until established by future\nnotice and comment rulemaking by OIG. As a result, actors would not be subject to penalties\nuntil CMP rules are final. At a minimum, the timeframe for enforcement would not begin sooner\nthan the compliance date of this final rule and will depend on when the CMP rules are final.\n\nDiscretion will be exercised such that conduct that occurs before that time will not be subject to\ninformation blocking CMPs.\n\nWe are aware that some actors may currently have in place licensing agreements that\ncontravene the information blocking provision and do not meet the requisite conditions for\n\n\n\n\nthis exception. We expect actors in these situations to take immediate steps to come into\ncompliance with the information blocking provision by amending their contracts or\nagreements to eliminate or void any clauses that contravene the information blocking\nprovision. We emphasize that an existing license is no excuse or justification for information\nblocking. One of the ways we have heard that actors interfere with the access, exchange, and\nuse of EHI is through formal restrictions, such as discriminatory licensing agreements, and\nthis final rule, as well as this exception, seek to address those very circumstances and\nsituations.\n\n*Comments.* One commenter expressed concern about this exception on privacy and\nsecurity grounds. The commenter noted that a proliferation of EHI to a multitude of entities\nwho have not and cannot be vetted is likely to increase the risks to the privacy and security of\nsuch data and create secondary and tertiary markets for such data without clear regulation and\noversight.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment and understand that the secondary use of data\ncreates privacy and security challenges in the health care industry and beyond. We refer\nreaders to section VIII.C.6 of this preamble for a detailed discussion of how we are addressing\nthis issue in this rule.\n\n\n",

We noted that the request could be made to “license” or “use” the interoperability\nelements because a requestor may not always know that “license” is the legal mechanism for\n“use” when making the request (84 FR 7546).\n\nIn order to meet this condition, we proposed that the actor would be required to\n\n\n\n\nrespond to the requestor within 10 business days from the receipt of the request by: (1)\nnegotiating with the requestor in a RAND fashion to identify the interoperability elements that\nare needed; and (2) offering an appropriate license with RAND terms, consistent with its other\nobligations under the exception. We emphasized that, in order to qualify for the proposed\nexception, the actor would only be required to negotiate with the requestor in a RAND fashion\nand to offer a license with RAND terms. We proposed that the actor would not be required to\ngrant a license in all instances. We did not propose a set timeframe for when the negotiations\nmust be resolved (84 FR 7546).\n\nWe requested comment on whether 10 business days is an appropriate amount of time\nfor the actor to respond to the requestor. We noted that we considered proposing response\ntimeframes ranging from 5 business days to 15 business days. We also considered proposing\ntwo separate timeframes for: (1) negotiating with the requestor; and (2) offering the license.\n\nWe stated that if commenters prefer a different response timeframe or approach than\nproposed, we requested that commenters explain their rationale with as much detail as\npossible. In addition, we requested comment on whether we should create set limits for: (1)\nthe amount of time the requestor has to accept the actor’s initial offer or make a counteroffer;\n(2) if the requestor makes a counteroffer, the amount of time the actor has to accept the\nrequestor’s counteroffer or make its own counteroffer; and (3) an allowable number of\ncounteroffers in negotiations (84 FR 7546).\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments regarding the proposed framework and\ntimeframe for responding to requests to license or use interoperability elements. Some\ncommenters were supportive of our proposal and stated that 10 business days is an appropriate\namount of time for the actor to respond to the requestor. Other commenters disagreed with the\nproposed timeframe, explaining that 10 business days is insufficient time to begin a license\n\n\n\n\nnegotiation. Commenters suggested various alternate timeframes ranging from 20 to 90\nbusiness days. One commenter requested that ONC consider differentiating the timeline\nexpected for making an offer predicated on an interoperability element being available as an\nexisting capability, as opposed to an interoperability element requiring new formal licensure\nor requiring one off “custom” or “spec” development. Another commenter recommended that\nthe process be divided into a series of steps with a requirement that a request for information\nbe acknowledged and negotiations begin within 10 business days and completed within 20\nbusiness days. One commenter recommended that the 10-day timeframe be for beginning\nnegotiations with the intent to furnish a quotation for a license. Some commenters stated that\ntimeframes should not be set, as the license negotiation process is highly variable based on the\nspecific requestor and circumstances. One commenter expressed concern that the proposed\nexception would increase the administrative burden on covered entities, particularly regarding\nthe response timeframe and the actor’s inability to review and/or vet the appropriateness of a\nrequest before responding.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments. To be responsive to\ncomments, we have updated the response and license negotiation framework and timeframe.\n\nThe finalized provision in § 171.303(a) states that, upon receiving a request to license an\ninteroperability element for the access, exchange, or use of EHI, the actor must: (1) begin\nlicense negotiations with the requestor within 10 business days from receipt of the request (§\n171.303(a)(1)); and (2) negotiate a license with the requestor, subject to the licensing\nconditions in paragraph (b) of the exception, within 30 business days from receipt of the\nrequest (§ 171.303(a)(2)). We note that the expectation in (2) above is that the actor will\nnegotiate with the requestor in good faith. If it is determined that the negotiation is not in good\nfaith, the actor would not qualify for this exception. These provisions create a clear and\n\n\n\n\nadministrable timeline for actors to follow that is informed by stakeholder comments and will\nreduce potential burden on actors. Further, it provides actors with appropriate flexibility for\nnegotiating a good faith license, taking into consideration the potential complexity and\nvariability associated with negotiations for licensing interoperability elements.\n\nIn instances when an actor is unable to negotiate a good faith license subject to the\nrequirements in § 171.303(a)(2), the actor may not meet the conditions of this exception. As part\nof an information blocking investigation, ONC and OIG may consider documentation or other\nwritings maintained by the actor around the time of the request that indicate why the actor was\nunable to meet the conditions. This would not permit the actor to be covered by this exception,\nbut discretion in determining whether to enforce the information blocking provision may be\nexercised.\n\nWe note that we have revised paragraph § 171.303(a) by changing “a request to license\nor use” to “a request to license” for clarity. We emphasize, however, that this change does not\nalter the meaning or application of the provision. We reiterate, as we proposed, that the\nrequest could be made to “license” or “use” the interoperability elements because a requestor\nmay not always know that “license” is the legal mechanism for “use” when making the\nrequest (see 84 FR 7546). We believe it is unnecessary to include “or use” in the regulation\ntext because actors should know that a request to “use” would be synonymous with a request\nto “license” and would thus be covered by this exception. Further, the inclusion of “or use”\ncould be confusing since “use” is a defined term in the context of “access, exchange, or use”\nof EHI, but would carry different meaning in the context of “using” an interoperability\nelement, as opposed to “using” EHI.\n\n\n",

                      "text": "We proposed to require, as a condition of this exception, that any terms upon which an\n\n\n\n\nactor licenses interoperability elements must be reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND).\n\nWe recognized in the Proposed Rule that strong legal protections for IP rights can promote\ncompetition and innovation. Nevertheless, IP rights can also be abused in ways that undermine\nthese goals. We explained that we believe this potential for abuse is heightened when the IP\nrights pertain to functional aspects of technology that are essential to enabling interoperability.\n\nWe emphasized that to the extent that the interoperability elements are essential to enable the\nefficient access, exchange, or use of EHI by particular persons or for particular purposes, any\npractice by the actor that could impede the use of the interoperability elements for that\npurpose—or that could unnecessarily increase the cost or other burden of using the elements\nfor that purpose—would give rise to an obvious risk of interference with access, exchange, or\nuse of EHI under the information blocking provision (84 FR 7546).\n\nWe explained that our goal was to balance the need for IP protections with the need to\nensure that this proposed exception does not permit actors to abuse their IP or other\nproprietary rights in inappropriate ways that would block the development, adoption, or use of\ninteroperable technologies and services. The abuse of IP rights in such ways is incompatible\nwith the information blocking provision, which protects the investments that taxpayers and the\nhealth care industry have made to adopt technologies that will enable the efficient sharing of\nEHI to benefit consumers and the health care system. We emphasized that while actors are\nentitled to protect and exercise their IP rights, to benefit from the exception to the information\nblocking provision they must do so on terms that do not undermine these efforts and prevent\nthe appropriate flow of EHI. We proposed that these requirements would apply to both price\nterms (such as royalties and license fees) and other terms, such as conditions or limitations on\naccess to interoperability elements or the purposes for which they can be used (see 84 FR\n7546).\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* Several health IT developers strongly disagreed with the framework and\nconditions of this exception. These commenters stated that compulsory licensing of health IT\non RAND terms is inconsistent with the usual use of RAND with regards to standards\ndevelopment. The commenters opined that the proposed exception is a significant overstep\nthat exceeds Congressional intent in the Cures Act and would have a detrimental effect on\ninnovation in the industry. Commenters stated that IP rights would not be adequately protected\nunder the exception, as the exception would allow unprecedented access to IP, and requested\nthat ONC better protect IP rights in the final rule. One commenter recommended that ONC\nmake clear that there are other ways for actors to be in compliance with the information\nblocking provision besides licensing interoperability elements to all.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these comments. Responsive to these comments, we have\nremoved all references to “RAND.” However, we have finalized the majority of the\nsubstantive conditions for the licensing of interoperability elements under this exception (§\n171.303(b)) as proposed (i.e., the sections on scope of rights, reasonable royalty, non-\ndiscriminatory terms, collateral terms, and non-disclosure agreement), with slight\nmodifications discussed below.\n\nIn response to comments regarding compulsory licensing, we emphasize that we do not\nview this exception as constituting compulsory licensing. Each exception is voluntary and actors\nmay choose whether or not they want to seek coverage under an exception. The exceptions\noperate to the benefit of actors and are intended to provide actors with certainty that certain\npractices that would normally constitute information blocking will not be considered information\nblocking, provided the actor’s practice meets the conditions of the exception. The fact that a\npractice to license interoperability elements does not meet the conditions of an exception does not\nmean that the practice would necessarily constitute information blocking. As a result, practices\n\n\n\n\nthat do not meet the exception will have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in order to assess\nthe specific facts and circumstances and to determine, for example, the actor’s intent and whether\nthe practice rises to the level of an interference.\n\nIn addition, under the Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301), we establish that an\nactor is not required to respond to a request to access, exchange, or use EHI in the manner\nrequested if the actor would be required to license IP and cannot reach agreeable terms for the\nlicense with the requestor (§ 171.301(b)(1)(ii)). This provision allows actors who do not want\nto license their IP to respond in an alternative manner that does not require the licensing of\nproprietary IP. Further, if the actor chooses to respond in the manner requested, and such\nmanner requires the licensing of an interoperability element(s), the actor could license the\ninteroperability elements(s) with whatever terms the actor chooses, so long as the actor is able\nto reach agreeable terms with the requestor. We refer readers to the discussion in the Content\nand Manner Exception in VIII.D.2.a, which highlights how the Content and Manner\nException supports an actor’s ability to protect their IP.\n\nWe understand and appreciate that health IT developers and other entities have\ninvested significant resources to innovate and our policies aim to support these innovations\nand advancements regarding the access, exchange, and use of EHI. We stress that this\nexception was drafted with innovation in mind and operates to benefit health IT developers\nand other actors by allowing them to obtain remuneration for their IP. The Cures Act did not\ncreate a specific carve out to the information blocking provision for IP rights, but did provide\nHHS with the authority to establish reasonable and necessary exceptions that do not constitute\ninformation blocking. We interpret the definition of information blocking in the Cures Act\n(section 3022(a) of the PHSA) to encompass any fee that materially discourages or otherwise\ninhibits the access, exchange, or use of EHI, so long as the actor has the requisite intent in the\n\n\n\n\nstatute. Thus, without clarifying this exception, an actor could implicate the information\nblocking provision whenever it charged any royalty to license its interoperability elements.\n\nWe believe this broad interpretation of the information blocking provision would have a\ndetrimental effect of innovation, competition, and consumer welfare. As such, we established\nthis exception to provide assurances to actors that licensing of interoperability elements for\naccess, exchange, or use will not be considered information blocking, so long as the actor’s\npractice meets all conditions in the exception. We reiterate that the actor would also need to\nhave the requisite intent, as set forth in the statute. We emphasize that actors are able to make\nreasonable profits from the licensing of interoperability elements, so long as such profits\ncomply with the “reasonable royalty” provision in this exception in § 171.303(b)(2). We also\nnote that the non-disclosure agreement provision in § 171.303(b)(5) establishes additional IP\nprotections.\n\nWe emphasize that, in the context of information blocking, control of interoperability\nelements is often a proxy for control of access, exchange and use of EHI. For example, where\nEHI is stored in a proprietary format, the EHI cannot be accessed or used if information about\nthe proprietary format does not accompany the EHI. Similarly, when EHI is stored\nelectronically, a technological solution must exist to make the EHI available for use by others.\n\nWe clarify that health IT developers are not required to license all of their IP. As discussed\nearlier in this section, an actor would not need to seek coverage under this exception if the\nactor’s practice is not likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of actual EHI. Thus,\nan essential element of the information blocking provision is that there is actual EHI at stake.\n\nFurther, as discussed above, there would also need to be a nexus between a requestor’s need to\nlicense an interoperability element and the existing EHI. If there is not such a nexus, the actor\nwould not need to seek coverage under this exception (see the Privacy Exception discussion in\n\n\n\n\nVIII.D.1.b).\n\nWe clarify that, if an actor licenses an interoperability element to one requestor, the\nactor must license that same interoperability element to future similarly situated requestors\nwith the same terms. Once an actor has granted a license for a particular interoperability\nelement, an actor cannot choose to license an interoperability element to one requestor and\nthen refuse or use different terms to license the same interoperability element to a second\nsimilarly situated requestor, even if the actor offers to provide the EHI via an alternative\nmanner in accordance with the Content and Manner Exception in § 171.301. In other words,\nan actor cannot pick and choose who can license a given interoperability element or who gets\nfavorable license terms based on the actor’s relationship with the requestor.\n\n*Comments.* A couple of commenters noted that there is a wide-spectrum of\nperspectives among stakeholders of common license agreement terms such as limitations on\nliability and indemnification, which may make reasonableness and non-discriminatory aspects\nchallenging to interpret.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate these concerns and understand that there is the potential for\nsignificant variability in the terms included in license agreements, particularly for licensing\ninteroperability elements. We believe the conditions adopted in this final exception are clear,\nequitable, and implementable. We emphasize that each information blocking case will turn on\nits own unique facts and circumstances. This fact-based approach is appropriate for this\nexception particularly due to the potential variability in interoperability elements and licensing\nterms noted by the commenters.\n\nScope of rights\nTo qualify for the proposed exception, we proposed that the actor must license the\nrequested interoperability elements with all rights necessary to access and use the\n\n\n\n\ninteroperability elements for the following purposes, as applicable:\n All rights necessary to access and use the interoperability elements for the\npurpose of developing products or services that are interoperable with the actor’s\nhealth IT or with health IT under the actor’s control and/or any third party who\ncurrently uses the actor’s interoperability elements to interoperate with the actor’s\nhealth IT or health IT under the actor’s control. These rights would include the\nright to incorporate and use the interoperability elements in the licensee’s own\ntechnology to the extent necessary to accomplish this purpose.\n\n All rights necessary to market, offer, and distribute the interoperable products and\nservices described above to potential customers and users, including the right to\ncopy or disclose the interoperability elements as necessary to accomplish this\npurpose.\n\n All rights necessary to enable the use of the interoperable products or services in\nproduction environments, including using the interoperability elements to access\nand enable the exchange and use of EHI (84 FR 7546 and 7547).\n\nWe requested comment on whether these rights are sufficiently inclusive to support\nlicensees in developing interoperable technologies, bringing them to market, and deploying\nthem for use in production environments. We also requested comment on the breadth of these\nrequired rights and if they should be subject to any limitations that would not interfere with\nthe uses we have described above (84 FR 7547).\n\n*Comments.* We received a couple of comments regarding the scope of rights under this\nexception. One commenter recommended that ONC specify that actors can require that\nlicensees of the proprietary IP embodied in an interoperability element use that IP only for the\nlicensed purpose, or ONC should allow actors to decline to license that IP at all. One\n\n\n\n\ncommenter suggested that we broaden the scope of rights regarding the development of\nproducts or services that are interoperable so that interoperability does not need to be tied to\nthe actor’s health IT, health IT under the actor’s control, or any third party who currently uses\nthe actor’s interoperability elements to interoperate with the actor’s health IT or health IT\nunder the actor’s control.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments. We have streamlined\nthe “scope of rights” section of this exception for clarity and to align with the overarching goal\nthroughout the information blocking section of enabling the access, exchange, and use of EHI.\n\nThe finalized “scope of rights” section in § 171.303(c)(1) states that the license must provide\nall rights necessary to: (1) enable the access, exchange, or use of EHI; and (2) achieve the\nintended access, exchange, or use of EHI via the interoperability element(s). These rights\nreplaced the rights we proposed in the “scope of rights” section (see proposed §\n171.206(b)(1)(i)-(iii) and 84 FR 7546 and 7547) because they more clearly and succinctly\nexplain the scope of rights we were trying to convey in the Proposed Rule. The proposed\nscope of rights included examples that are not necessary in the regulatory text.\n\nRegarding the comment that we should specify that actors can require that licensees of\nthe proprietary IP embodied in an interoperability element use that IP only for the licensed\npurpose, or ONC should allow actors to decline to license that IP at all, we clarify that actors\nmay require that licensees of the proprietary IP embodied in an interoperability element only\nuse that IP for the licensed purpose, so long as such limits are in compliance with all the\nconditions in § 171.303, including the scope of rights provisions in § 171.303(c)(1). For\ninstance, an actor could place a limitation in the license that the license only covers a one-time\nuse of the interoperability element for accessing and exchanging certain EHI. In this scenario,\nthis limitation could be allowed under the exception if: (1) despite the limitation, the licensee’s\n\n\n\n\nrequest for access, exchange, or use of EHI is met; and (2) the limitation complies with the\nconditions in § 171.303. Similarly, if an app developer requests to license a health IT\ndeveloper’s interoperability element in order to enable the exchange of EHI by integrating the\napp developer’s CDS software into Provider A’s EHR, the health IT developer could scope\nthe rights in the license to restrict the app developer from using the license to complete the\nsame integration for Provider B, so long as the license complies with the conditions in §\n171.303. We also emphasize that under the Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301), actors\nare decline to license their proprietary IP so long as they are able to respond to the request to\naccess, exchange, or use EHI through an alternative manner specified in §\n171.301(b)(2)(ii)(A)-(C).\n\nWe have decided not to broaden the scope of rights regarding the development of\nproducts or services that are interoperable as suggested by the commenter because we believe\nthis provision, as proposed, is appropriately tailored to addresses information blocking and\nshould be focused on health IT under the actor’s control or any third party who currently uses\nthe actor’s interoperability elements to interoperate with health IT under the actor’s control.\n\nReasonable royalty\nAs a condition of this exception, we proposed that if an actor charges a royalty for the\nuse of interoperability elements, the royalty base and rate must be reasonable. Importantly, we\nproposed that the reasonableness of any royalties would be assessed solely on the basis of the\nindependent value of the actor’s technology to the licensee’s product, not on any strategic\nvalue stemming from the actor’s control over essential means of accessing, exchanging, or\nusing EHI (84 FR 7547).\n\nIn evaluating the actor’s assertions and evidence that the royalty was reasonable, we\nproposed that ONC may consider the following factors:\n\n\n\n\n The royalties received by the actor for the licensing of the proprietary elements in\nother circumstances comparable to RAND-licensing circumstances.\n\n The rates paid by the licensee for the use of other comparable proprietary\nelements.\n\n The nature and scope of the license.\n\n The effect of the proprietary elements in promoting sales of other products of the\nlicensee and the licensor, taking into account only the contribution of the\nelements themselves and not of the enhanced interoperability that they enable.\n\n The utility and advantages of the actor’s interoperability element over the existing\ntechnology, if any, that had been used to achieve a similar level of access,\nexchange, or use of EHI.\n\n The contribution of the elements to the technical capabilities of the licensee’s\nproducts, taking into account only the value of the elements themselves and not\nthe enhanced interoperability that they enable.\n\n The portion of the profit or of the selling price that may be customary in the\nparticular business or in comparable businesses to allow for the use of the\nproprietary elements or analogous elements that are also covered by RAND\ncommitments.\n\n The portion of the realizable profit that should be credited to the proprietary\nelements as distinguished from non-proprietary elements, the manufacturing\nprocess, business risks, significant features or improvements added by the\nlicensee, or the strategic value resulting from the network effects, switching costs,\nor other effects of the adoption of the actor’s technology.\n\n\n\n\n The opinion testimony of qualified experts.\n\n The amount that a licensor and a licensee would have agreed upon (at the time the\nlicensee began using the elements) if both were considering the RAND obligation\nunder the exception and its purposes, and had been reasonably and voluntarily\ntrying to reach an agreement (84 FR 7547).\n\nWe noted that these factors mirror those used by courts that have examined the\nreasonableness of royalties charged pursuant to a commitment to a standards developing\norganization to license standard-essential technologies on RAND terms (see Microsoft Corp.\n\n\n",

We noted, however, that we adapted the factors to the\ninformation blocking context (84 FR 7547).\n\nWe proposed that the RAND inquiry should focus on whether the royalty demanded\nby the actor represents the independent value of the actor’s proprietary technology. We\nproposed that if the actor has licensed the interoperability element through a standards\ndeveloping organization in accordance with such organization’s policies regarding the\nlicensing of standards-essential technologies on RAND terms, the actor may charge a royalty\nthat is consistent with such policies. We proposed that we would ask whether the actor is\ncharging a royalty that is not based on the value of its technology (embodied in the\ninteroperability elements) but rather includes the strategic value stemming from the adoption\nof that technology by customers or users. We proposed that we would consider the technical\ncontribution of the actor’s interoperability elements to the licensee’s products—such as any\n187\nCase No. 10–cv–1823 JLR, 2013 WL 2111217 (W.D.Wash. Apr. 25, 2013).\n\n188\nMDL 2303, 2013 WL 5593609 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 3, 2013).\n\n189\nCase No. 5:12–cv–03451–RMW, 2014 WL 46997 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 6, 2014).\n\n\n\n\nproprietary capabilities or features that the licensee uses in its product—but would screen out\nany functional aspects of the actor’s technology that are used only to establish interoperability\nand enable EHI to be accessed, exchanged, and used. Additionally, we proposed that to\naddress the potential risk of royalty stacking, we would need to consider the aggregate\nroyalties that would apply if owners of other essential interoperability elements made royalty\ndemands of the implementer. Specifically, we proposed that, to qualify for the exception, the\nactor must grant licenses on terms that are objectively commercially reasonable taking into\naccount the overall licensing situation, including the cost to the licensee of obtaining other\ninteroperability elements that are important for the viability of the products for which it is\nseeking to license interoperability elements from the actor (84 FR 7547 and 7548).\n\nWe clarified that this condition would not preclude an actor from licensing its\ninteroperability elements pursuant to an existing RAND commitment to a standards\ndeveloping organization. We also noted that, in addition to complying with the requirements\ndescribed above, to meet this proposed condition, any royalties charged must meet the\ncondition, proposed separately below, that any license terms be non-discriminatory (84 FR\n7548).\n\nWe requested comment on these aspects of the proposed exception. We encouraged\ncommenters to consider, in particular, whether the factors and approach we described will be\nadministrable and appropriately balance the unreasonable blocking by actors of the use of\nessential interoperability elements with the need to provide adequate assurance to investors\nand innovators that they will be able to earn a reasonable return on their investments in\ninteroperable technologies. Further, we noted that if our proposed approach did not adequately\nbalance these concerns or would not achieve our stated policy goals, we asked that\ncommenters suggest revisions or alternative approaches. We asked that such comments be as\n\n\n\n\ndetailed as possible and provide rigorous economic justifications for any suggested revisions\nor alternative approaches (84 FR 7548).\n\n*Comments.* We received many comments regarding reasonable royalties and the ability\nof actors to make a profit. Some commenters supported the proposed framework. A couple of\ncommenters recommended that we not allow any royalty for licensing interoperability\nelements. One of those commenters suggested we require “RAND-Zero” licensing, by which\nthe copyright holder may still impose non-discriminatory licensing terms on the licensee but\nmay not charge a royalty. The commenter also expressed concern that the overlap between\nthis exception and the exception for recovering costs reasonably incurred creates the potential\nfor actors to earn a double recovery. The commenter explained that licensing of IP is intended\nto recoup the costs of development of that IP, so where the IP is an interoperability element,\nthe costs reasonably incurred for its development should be incorporated into the royalty rate.\n\nThe commenter recommended that we be clearer that in these circumstances, only a single\nrecovery is permitted. Provider and registry organizations were concerned that the ability to\ncharge reasonable royalties to license interoperability elements may present an opening for\nhealth IT developers to charge unreasonably high fees for exchanging information with\nprovider groups and registries. As such, the commenters recommended that ONC require\nactors to disclose the methodology behind their fees.\n\nAlternatively, other commenters, consisting primarily of health IT developers,\nexpressed concern that the proposals regarding reasonable royalties were too restrictive.\n\nCommenters were concerned that the exception, as proposed, would have a detrimental effect\non innovation in the industry as it provides disincentives for established companies to develop\nnew, forward-leaning solutions. A few commenters recommended that the value of the actor’s\ntechnology must be constructed on a “fair market” basis. Commenters stated that ONC should\n\n\n\n\nnot set or determine the reasonableness of royalties. However, if ONC decided to set or define\nthe reasonableness of royalties, the primary factor for such a determination should be the\nwillingness of licensees to agree to a given royalty rate. A couple of commenters requested\nclarification regarding ONC’s approach for calculating reasonable royalties and ONC’s basis\nfor determining whether a royalty is “reasonable.”\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments. First, we note, as\ndiscussed previously in this section, we have removed all references to “RAND.” However,\nwe have finalized this reasonable royalty provision (§ 171.303(c)(2)) as proposed, with a\nslight modification for consistency and the addition of a paragraph in § 171.303(c)(2)(iv). The\nslight modification was made to § 171.303(c)(2)(iii), in which we deleted “on reasonable and\nnon-discriminatory terms” in order to align with the overall approach of removing “RAND”\nthroughout the exception. In response to comment, we added a paragraph in §\n171.303(c)(2)(iv) to address the potential for double recovery in this exception and the Fees\nException (§ 171.302). The new paragraph states that an actor may not charge a royalty for IP\nif the actor recovered any development costs pursuant to § 171.302 that led to the creation of\nthe IP.\n\nIn response to the commenters who expressed concern that our approach for allowing\nreasonable royalties is too restrictive and could slow innovation, we emphasize that our\nregulatory approach to implementing the information blocking provision of the Cures Act is\ninformed by years of research and stakeholder engagement indicating that information\nblocking undermines public and private sector investments in the nation’s health IT\ninfrastructure and frustrates efforts to use modern technologies to improve health care quality\nand efficiency, accelerate research and innovation, and provide greater value and choice to\nhealth care consumers. In our experience, contractual and IP rights are frequently used to\n\n\n\n\nextract rents for access to EHI or to prevent competition from health IT developers of\ninteroperable technologies and services. These practices frustrate access, exchange, and use of\nEHI and stifle competition and innovation in the health IT sector.\n\nWe believe the general claim that the limits on licensing royalties within this exception\nwould inhibit innovation misstates the experiences many stakeholders face today. Our\nexperience in the health IT industry has highlighted that innovation has struggled under\ncurrent market practices, in which there is no limit on fees and royalties for access and use of\ninteroperability elements. In fact, the ability of large entities with significant market power to\nprevent access and use of essential interoperability elements has prevented and continues to\nprevent large amounts of potential investment in innovative solutions for the United States\nhealth care market. We also refer readers to the Content and Manner Exception (§ 171.301),\nwhere we further address commenter concerns regarding protections for their proprietary IP.\n\nWe also appreciate the comments that suggested we not allow any royalty for licensing\ninteroperability elements because allowing a royalty could create an opening for actors to\ncontinue to charge unreasonably high fees for the exchange of EHI. We have decided to allow\nreasonable royalties that must meet certain requirements (see § 171.303(b)(2)) because the\nallowance of such royalties will promote competition, consumer welfare, and investment in\ninnovation. The conditions we have finalized in § 171.303(b)(2) are specifically tailored to\naddress the type of abuse about which commenters expressed concern. Under the finalized\nreasonable royalty provision, it would generally be appropriate for actors to license their IP on\nterms that are non-discriminatory and do not interfere with the access, exchange, or use of\nEHI so long as the actor meets all of the conditions in § 171.303. We emphasize that actors are\nable to make reasonable profits from the licensing of interoperability elements, so long as such\nprofits comply with § 171.303(b)(2). These licensing practices will further the goals of the\n\n\n\n\ninformation blocking provision by allowing actors to protect the value of their innovations and\nearn returns on the investments they have made to develop, maintain, and update those\ninnovations. This approach will also protect future incentives to invest in, develop, and\ndisseminate interoperable technologies and services that could improve the lives and safety of\npatients nationwide.\n\nWe acknowledge that limiting the royalties IP holders can charge for access, exchange,\nor use of EHI departs from IP policy. Absent specific circumstances, IP holders are generally\nfree to negotiate with prospective licensees to determine the royalty to practice their IP, and\nthis negotiated royalty frequently reflects the value the licensee would obtain from exercising\nthose rights. However, in the context of EHI, a limitation on royalties is essential due to the\nlikelihood that unreasonable royalties would frustrate access, exchange, and use of the EHI,\nparticularly because of the imbalanced power dynamics that currently exist in the health IT\nmarket.\n\nIn response to commenters who requested clarification regarding ONC’s approach for\ncalculating reasonable royalties, we emphasize that each case of potential information\nblocking, as well as the “reasonableness” of a royalty, will hinge on the specific facts and\ncircumstances of the case. We explained in the Proposed Rule that the actor would need to\nshow that the royalty base was reasonable and that the royalty was within a reasonable range\nfor the interoperability elements at issue. Importantly, we explained that the reasonableness of\nany royalties would be assessed solely on the basis of the independent value of the actor’s\ntechnology to the licensee’s product, not on any strategic value stemming from the actor’s\ncontrol over essential means of accessing, exchanging, or using EHI (84 FR 7547 and 7548).\n\nFor additional clarification regarding the specific factors to be considered in evaluating an\nactor’s assertion and evidence that a royalty was reasonable, we refer reader to the discussion\n\n\n\n\nabove and the discussion in the Proposed Rule regarding reasonable royalties (see 84 FR 7547\nand 7548).\n\nNon-discriminatory terms\nWe proposed that for the exception to apply, the terms on which an actor licenses and\notherwise provides interoperability elements must be non-discriminatory. We explained that\nthis condition would apply to both price and non-price terms, and thus would apply to the\nroyalty terms discussed immediately above as well as other types of terms that may be\nincluded in licensing agreements or other agreements related to the provision or use of\ninteroperability elements (84 FR 7548).\n\nWe proposed that to comply with this condition, the terms on which the actor licensed\nthe interoperability elements must be based on criteria that the actor applied uniformly for all\nsubstantially similar or similarly situated classes of persons and requests. In order to be\nconsidered non-discriminatory, such criteria would have to be objective and verifiable, not\nbased on the actor’s subjective judgment or discretion. We emphasized that this proposal does\nnot mean that the actor must apply the same terms for all persons or classes of persons\nrequesting a license. However, any differences in terms would have to be based on actual\ndifferences in the costs that the actor incurred or other reasonable and non-discriminatory\ncriteria. Moreover, we proposed that any criteria upon which an actor varies its terms or\nconditions would have to be both competitively neutral—meaning that the criteria are not\nbased in any part on whether the requestor or other person is a competitor, potential\ncompetitor, or will be using EHI obtained via the interoperability elements in a way that\nfacilitates competition with the actor—and neutral as to the revenue or other value that the\nrequestor may derive from access, exchange, or use of the EHI obtained via the\ninteroperability elements, including any secondary use of such EHI (84 FR 7548). For a\n\n\n\n\ndetailed example regarding this proposed condition, see the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7548).\n\nWe noted that the foregoing conditions were not intended to limit an actor’s flexibility\nto set different terms based on legitimate differences in the costs to different classes of persons\nor in response to different classes of requests, so long as any such classification was in fact\nbased on neutral criteria (in the sense described above) that are objectively verifiable and were\napplied in a consistent manner for persons and/or requests within each class. For instance, the\nproposed condition would not preclude an actor from pursuing strategic partnerships, joint\nventures, co-marketing agreements, cross-licensing agreements, and other similar types of\ncommercial arrangements under which it provides more favorable terms than for other persons\nwith whom it has a more arms-length relationship. We explained that in these instances, the\nactor should have no difficulty identifying substantial and verifiable efficiencies that\ndemonstrate that any variations in its terms and conditions were based on objective and neutral\ncriteria (84 FR 7548).\n\nWe proposed that a health IT developer of certified health IT who is an “API\nTechnology Supplier” under the Condition of Certification proposed in § 170.404 would not\nbe permitted to offer different terms in connection with the APIs required by that Condition of\nCertification. We proposed that API Technology Suppliers are required to make these APIs\navailable on terms that are no less favorable than provided to their own customers, suppliers,\npartners, and other persons with whom they have a business relationship (84 FR 7548 and\n7549).\n\nWe requested comments on the foregoing conditions (84 FR 7549).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter disagreed with the proposal that the terms must not be\nbased in any part on revenue or other value the requestor may derive from access, exchange,\nor use of EHI obtained via the interoperability elements, including the secondary use of such\n\n\n\n\nEHI. The commenter stated that such information should be considered.\n\n*Response.* We thank the commenter for this feedback, but have decided to finalize this\nprovision as proposed, with slight modification. We continue to believe that license terms for\nlicensing interoperability elements required for the access, exchange, or use of EHI should not\nbe based in any part of the revenue or other value the requestor may derive from access,\nexchange, or use of EHI obtained via the interoperability elements, including the subsequent\nuse of such EHI. The allowance of such terms could enable the type of opportunistic pricing\nand anti-competitive behavior that this exception seeks to address. We note that we have\nremoved the proposed example about “secondary use” from the regulation text because such\nan example is not necessary in the regulation text (see 84 FR 7604). We emphasize, however,\nthat we continue to maintain that the terms must not be based on revenue or other value\nderived from the subsequent use of EHI. Our policy on this point has not changed from the\nProposed Rule. The terms and conditions could vary based on neutral, objectively verifiable,\nand uniformly applied criteria. These might include, for example, significantly greater\nresources consumed by certain types of apps, such as those that export large volumes of data\non a continuous basis, or the heightened risks associated with apps designed to “write” data to\nthe EHR database or to run natively within the EHR’s user interface.\n\nWe emphasize that health IT developers that license interoperability elements in order\nfor EHI to be accessed, exchanged, or used could not vary the license terms and conditions\nbased on subjective criteria, such as whether it thinks an app will be “popular” or is a “good\nfit” for its ecosystem. Nor could developers offer different terms or conditions on the basis of\nobjective criteria that are not competitively neutral, such as whether an app “connects to”\nother technologies or services, provides capabilities that the EHR developer plans to\nincorporate in a future release of its technology, or enables an efficient means for customers to\n\n\n\n\nexport data for use in other databases or technologies that compete directly with the EHR\ndeveloper. Similarly, the EHR developer could not set different terms or conditions based on\nhow much revenue or other value the app might generate from the information it collects\nthrough the APIs, such as by introducing a revenue-sharing requirement for apps that use data\nfor secondary purposes that are very lucrative and for which the EHR developer would like a\n“piece of the pie.” Such practices would disqualify the actor from this exception and would\nimplicate the information blocking provision.\n\nWe note that we made a slight modification to § 171.303(c)(3)(i) in that we removed\n“substantially similar.” We believe “similarly situated,” without “substantially similar” is\nclearer, maintains the intended effect, and is consistent with language used in other\nexceptions.\n\nCollateral terms\nWe proposed five additional conditions that would reinforce the requirements of the\nproposed exception. We explained that these additional conditions would provide bright-line\nprohibitions for certain types of collateral terms or agreements that we believe are inherently\nlikely to interfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We proposed that any attempt to\nrequire a licensee or its agents or contractors to do or agree to do any of the following would\ndisqualify the actor from the exception and would be suspect under the information blocking\nprovision (84 FR 7549).\n\nFirst, we proposed that the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or\ncontractors to not compete with the actor in any product, service, or market, including markets\nfor goods and services, technologies, and research and development. We explained that we are\naware that such agreements have been used to either directly exclude suppliers of\ninteroperable technologies and services from the market or to create exclusivity that reduces\n\n\n\n\nthe range of technologies and options available to health care providers and other health IT\ncustomers and users (84 FR 7549).\n\nSecond, we proposed that the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or\ncontractors to deal exclusively with the actor in any product, service, or market, including\nmarkets for goods and services, technologies, and research and development (84 FR 7549).\n\nThird, we proposed that the actor must not require the licensee or its agents or\ncontractors to obtain additional licenses, products, or services that are not related to or can be\nunbundled from the requested interoperability elements. We explained that without this\ncondition, we believe that an actor could require a licensee to take a license to additional\ninteroperability elements that the licensee does not need or want, which could enable the actor\nto extract royalties that are inconsistent with its RAND obligations under this exception. We\nclarified that this condition would not preclude an actor and a willing licensee from agreeing\nto such an arrangement, so long as the arrangement was not required (84 FR 7549).\n\nFourth, we proposed that the actor must not condition the use of interoperability\nelements on a requirement or agreement to license, grant, assign, or transfer the licensee’s own\nIP to the actor. We explained that it would raise information blocking concerns for an actor to\nuse its control over interoperability elements as leverage to obtain a “grant back” of IP rights\nor other consideration whose value may exceed that of a reasonable royalty. We proposed that,\nconsistent with our approach under other conditions of this exception, this condition would not\npreclude an actor and a willing licensee from agreeing to a cross-licensing, co-marketing, or\nother agreement if they so choose. However, the actor could not require the licensee to enter\ninto such an agreement. We proposed that the actor must offer the option of licensing the\ninteroperability elements without a promise to provide consideration beyond a reasonable\nroyalty (84 FR 7549).\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we proposed that the actor must not condition the use of interoperability\nelements on a requirement or agreement to pay a fee of any kind whatsoever unless the fee\nmeets either the narrowly crafted condition to this exception for a reasonable royalty, or,\nalternatively, the fee satisfies the separate exception in § 171.302, which permits the recovery\nof certain costs reasonably incurred (84 FR 7549).\n\nWe requested comment on these categorical exclusions. In particular, we encouraged\ncommenters to weigh in on our assumption that these practices are inherently likely to\ninterfere with access, exchange, or use of EHI. We also encouraged commenters to suggest\nany conceivable benefits that these practices might offer for interoperability or for competition\nand consumers that we might have overlooked. Again, we asked that to the extent possible\ncommenters provide detailed economic rationale in support of their comments (84 FR 7549).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter noted that situations exist where licensors do not have the\nability to lawfully confer rights or licenses to information or products without the agreement\nof a third party. The commenter recommended that we add “except as required by law” to the\ncollateral terms provisions in order to clarify that the expectation is not that an actor must\nobtain such rights on behalf of the requestor.\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this comment, but have decided not to make the suggested\nedit because we do not believe such an addition is necessary. The collateral terms provisions\ndo not address whether an actor is expected to obtain rights from a third party to lawfully\nconfer rights or licenses to interoperability elements. Instead, the collateral terms provisions\ndescribe conditions that the actors must not require of the licensee or its agents or contractors\nto do because such conditions are inherently likely to interfere with access, exchange, or use\nof EHI. We note that we have revised the definition of “interoperability element” (see §\n171.102) to clarify that in order to meet the definition, the element must be “controlled by the\n\n\n\n\nactor,” which addresses the commenter’s concern. We have also defined “controlled by the\nactor” in § 171.102 in the context of the interoperability element definition for clarity. If the\nactor could not lawfully confer a right or authorization, the actor would not have the requisite\n“control” under the “interoperability element.” Last, we emphasize that in situations when an\nactor does not have the ability to lawfully confer rights or licenses to enable the access,\nexchange, or use of EHI, the actor could seek coverage under the Infeasibility Exception (see\n§ 171.204(a)(3)) or the Content and Manner Exception (see § 171.301(b)).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any other comments regarding the proposed collateral\nterms proposals except those noted in the comment summary above.\n\n*Response.* We have finalized the collateral terms as proposed.\n\nNon-disclosure agreement\nWe proposed that an actor would be permitted under this exception to require a\nlicensee to agree to a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect the actor’s\ntrade secrets, provided that the NDA is no broader than necessary to prevent the unauthorized\ndisclosure of the actor’s trade secrets. Further, we proposed that the actor would have to\nidentify (in the NDA) the specific information that it claims as trade secrets, and that such\ninformation would have to meet the definition of a trade secret under applicable law. We\nnoted that if the actor is a health IT developer of certified health IT, it may be subject to the\nCondition of Certification that prohibits certain health IT developer prohibitions and\nrestrictions on communications about a health IT developer’s technology and business\npractices. We emphasized that the exception would not in any way abrogate the developer’s\nobligations to comply with that condition. We encouraged comment on this condition of the\nproposed exception (84 FR 7549).\n\n*Comments.* We received a couple of comments regarding the proposed NDA\n\n\n\n\nprovision. One commenter recommended that we state in the final rule that interoperability\nelements themselves may not be protected as trade secrets. Another commenter expressed\nconcern that this exception acts to require NDAs in certain circumstances. The commenter\nalso suggested edits to preamble language that would allow the actor to “generally” identify\nthe information that it claims as trade secrets, as opposed to the proposed language of\nidentifying the “specific” information that it claims as trade secrets.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these thoughtful comments. We clarify that\ninteroperability elements may be protected as trade secrets. Trade secrets are a type of IP that\nconsist of information and can include a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device,\nmethod, technique or process, 190\nand could fall within the definition of “interoperability\nelement” (see § 171.102). We note, as discussed in more detail in VIII.C.5.b, that we have\nleveraged the definition of “health information technology” from section 3000(5) of the PHSA\nfor the definition of “interoperability element” in § 171.102, and that IP is included in that\ndefinition of “health information technology.” The PHSA defines “health information\ntechnology” as “hardware, software, integrated technologies or related licenses, intellectual\nproperty, upgrades, or packaged solutions sold as services that are designed for or support the\nuse by health care entities or patients for the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or\nexchange of health information.”\n\nIn response to the commenter that expressed concern that this exception acts to require\nNDAs in certain circumstances, we emphasize that we are not requiring NDAs. We included\nthis provision in order to help actors protect their IP and actors may draft the NDA in a\nmanner that best suits their needs so long as the NDA meets the requisite conditions in §\n190\nUSPTO, Trade Secret Policy, https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/international-protection/trade-\nsecrets-policy.\n\n\n\n\n171.303(b)(5). We have decided not to allow actors to “generally” identify the information\nthat they claim as trade secrets because such a change could enable actors to make broad\nassertions of trade secret protection that exceed the actual trade secrets. The safeguards we\nhave finalized in the NDA provision (e.g., that the agreement is no broader than necessary to\nprevent unauthorized disclosure of the actor's trade secrets and the agreement states with\nparticularity all information the actor claims as trade secrets) are necessary to ensure that the\nNDA is not used to impose restrictions or burdensome requirements that are not actually\nnecessary to protect the actor’s trade secrets and that impede the use of the interoperability\nelements. We emphasize that the use of an NDA for such purposes would preclude an actor\nfrom qualifying for this exception and would implicate the information blocking provision.\niii. Additional Requirements Relating to the Provision of\nInteroperability Elements\nWe proposed that an actor’s practice would need to comply with additional conditions\nthat ensure that actors who license interoperability elements on RAND terms do not engage in\nseparate practices that impede the use of those elements or otherwise undermine the intent of\nthis exception. We explained that these conditions are analogous to the conditions described in\nour proposal concerning collateral terms but address a broader range of practices that may not\nbe effected through the license agreements themselves or that occur separately from the\nlicensing negotiations and other dealings between the actor and the licensee. Specifically, we\nproposed that an actor would not qualify for this exception if it engaged in a practice that had\nthe purpose or effect of impeding the efficient use of the interoperability elements to access,\nexchange, or use EHI for any permissible purpose; or the efficient development, distribution,\ndeployment, or use of an interoperable product or service for which there is actual or potential\ndemand. We explained that the exception would not apply if the developer licensed its\n\n\n\n\nproprietary APIs for use by third-party apps but then prevented or delayed the use of those\napps in production environments by, for example, restricting or discouraging customers from\nenabling the use of the apps, or engaging in “gate keeping” practices, such as requiring apps to\ngo through a vetting process and then applying that process in a discriminatory or\nunreasonable manner. Finally, to ensure the actor’s commitments under this exception are\ndurable, we proposed one additional safeguard: An actor could not avail itself of this\nexception if, having licensed the interoperability elements, the actor makes changes to the\nelements or its technology that “break” compatibility or otherwise degrade the performance or\ninteroperability of the licensee’s products or services (84 FR 7549 and 7550).\n\nWe emphasized that this proposed condition would in no way prevent an actor from\nmaking improvements to its technology or responding to the needs of its own customers or\nusers. However, to benefit from the exception, the actor’s practice would need to be necessary\nto accomplish these purposes and the actor must have afforded the licensee a reasonable\nopportunity under the circumstances to update its technology to maintain interoperability (84\nFR 7550).\n\n*Comments.* One commenter stated that the proposed restriction regarding breaking\ncompatibility or otherwise degrading the performance or interoperability of the licensee’s\nproducts or services is too broad. The commenter suggested that ONC add procedural\nsafeguards to avoid misuse and unpredictable enforcement. Specifically, the commenter\nrecommended that ONC: (1) institute a grace period for licensors to provide fixes where\ninteroperability elements are inadvertently unavailable due to software changes; (2) permit\nhealth IT developers to maintain their existing processes to notify customers about upgraded\nstandards on a reasonable timeframe; (3) allow, with a year’s notice, retirement of\nfunctionality in future versions of the software; (4) acknowledge that the use of\n\n\n\n\ninteroperability elements will always require some initial work and ongoing upkeep by the\nlicensee, such as testing and continuous work to deploy technology at health systems with\ndifferent workflows; and (5) the ONC-administered advisory opinion process should account\nfor review of RAND licensing terms to provide clarity to the regulated actors.\n\n*Response.* We agree with the commenter that it is critical that the final exceptions are\ntransparent and cannot be misused. Each exception should clearly explain what conduct would\nbe covered by the exception and what conduct falls outside the scope of the exception. In\nresponse to the commenter, we note that we have not prevented health IT developers from\nmaintaining their existing processes to notify customers about upgraded standards on a\nreasonable timeframe, nor have we instituted any new policies regarding the retirement of\nfunctionality in future versions of software. Further, we acknowledge that the use of\ninteroperability elements may require some initial work and ongoing upkeep by the licensee,\nsuch as testing and continuous work to deploy technology in health systems with different\nworkflows. However, we emphasize that such initial work, ongoing upkeep, or any additional\nburden on licensees must meet all the conditions of this exception as all relevant times.\n\nWe have decided not to institute a grace period for licensors to provide fixes where\ninteroperability elements are inadvertently unavailable due to software changes because we do\nnot believe such a grace period is necessary. Having consulted with OIG, we note that OIG\ngenerally does not pursue civil monetary penalties for actors who make innocent mistakes or for\naccidental conduct. Future notice and comment rulemaking by OIG will provide more additional\ndetail regarding information blocking enforcement.\n\nWe may consider developing materials in the future regarding the application of the\nexceptions should the need arise. However, we believe the final rule clearly describes the\nconditions actors must meet in order to be covered by each exception, and informational\n\n\n\n\nmaterials are not necessary at this time.\niv. Compliance with Conditions of Certification\nAs a final condition of the proposed exception, we proposed that health IT developers\nof certified health IT who are subject to the Conditions of Certification proposed in §§\n170.402, 170.403, and 170.404 must comply with all requirements of those Conditions of\nCertification for all practices and at all relevant times (84 FR 7550).\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments on this proposed condition.\n\n*Response.* We have removed this proposed condition from the final rule for\nconsistency with other exceptions and for clarity, as the condition is not necessary.\n\n\n",

A health IT developer suggested a new exception to allow\nactors to withhold sensitive information. The commenter expressed concern that EHI at a\ncertain data class or data element level will require health care providers to exert substantial\nmanual effort to mediate disclosure. Health care providers and provider organizations\nsuggested an exception that would exempt actors from the information blocking provision if\nthey are protecting privileged information. One commenter expressed concern about providing\naccess, exchange, or use of quality program and reporting data. A hospital suggested that\nrequiring providers to waive privilege in order to avoid information blocking would have a\ndetrimental effect on peer reviews and safety assessments that help providers resolve adverse\nevents.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these suggestions. We first note that the health\ninformation must fall within the EHI definition, which aligns with the ePHI definition\ncontained in the HIPAA Rules. We note that actors faced with a request to access, exchange,\nWe note that actors faced with a request to access, exchange, or use sensitive and/or privileged\ninformation can seek coverage under the exceptions for preventing harm (§ 171.201),\npromoting the privacy of EHI (§ 171.202), promoting the security of EHI (§ 171.203), or\ninfeasibility (§ 171.204), depending on the specific information at issue and the circumstances\nof the case. We refer readers to those exceptions, as well as the preamble discussions at\nsections VIII.D.1 (Preventing Harm Exception), VIII.D.2 (Privacy Exception), VIII.D.3\n(Security Exception), and VIII.D.4 (Infeasibility Exception). We also note that an actor would\nnot be required to share EHI if the interference with access, exchange, or use of the EHI is\nexplicitly required by State or Federal law (see the discussion regarding “required by law” at\n\n\n\n\nsection VIII.C.1 of this preamble). We emphasize that this final rule does not require actors to\nwaive privilege provided by law.\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters expressed concern about the effect of the information\nblocking provision on research. Public health organizations proposed an exception to exclude\nresearch (as defined by 45 CFR 164.501) and non-direct clinical care conducted by public\nhealth authorities, from implicating the information blocking provision. A hospital requested\nthat we establish a new sub-exception under the exception for preventing harm that would\nallow health care providers who conduct research at their institutions to require that other\nproviders who request EHI are also collaborators in that research. One commenter suggested\nan exception for health care providers who cannot send data to a public health registry when\nthe public health agency is not ready to onboard the provider due factors outside of the\nprovider’s control (e.g., lack of resources or a backup in the onboarding queue).\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for these suggestions. We note that actors faced with\na request to access, exchange, or use EHI related to research can seek coverage under the\nexceptions for promoting the privacy of EHI (§ 171.202) or infeasibility (§ 171.204),\ndepending on the specific research being conducted and EHI at issue. We refer readers to\nthose exceptions, as well as the preamble discussions at sections VIII.D.2 (Privacy Exception)\nand VIII.D.4 (Infeasibility Exception). We also note that an actor would not be required to\nshare EHI if the interference with access, exchange, or use of the EHI is explicitly required by\nState or Federal law (see the discussion regarding “required by law” at section VIII.C.1 of this\npreamble).\n\n*Comments.* Some commenters requested a new exception to protect actors who seek\nindependent opinions from external validators regarding their business practices, in case one\nof those practices falls within the definition of information blocking.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this suggestion. With regard to private “external validators,”\nwe note that we are not restricting an actor’s ability to hire private companies to assess its\nbusiness practices.\n\n*Comments.* A commenter recommended an exception for standard business practices.\n\nThe commenter explained that examples of such conduct include suspending the access of any\nhealth IT developer or e-prescribing application that is not compliant with State laws or uses\nthe provider’s technology platform for reasons that compromises the integrity of the\nprovider’s network (e.g., using the network for commercial messaging).\n\n*Response.* We appreciate this suggestion. While we would need more facts to properly\nassess these scenarios, we believe that such situations could likely be covered by either the\nexception for promoting the privacy of EHI (§ 171.202) or the exception for promoting the\nsecurity of EHI (§ 171.203). We refer readers to those exceptions, as well as the preamble\ndiscussions at sections VIII.D.2 (Privacy Exception) and VIII.D.3 (Security Exception).

          "text": "We explained in the Proposed Rule that section 3022(d)(3)(A) of the PHSA directs the\nNational Coordinator to implement a standardized process for the public to submit reports on\nclaims of information blocking (84 FR 7552). Section 3022(d)(3)(B) further requires that the\ncomplaint process provide for the collection of such information as the originating institution,\nlocation, type of transaction, system and version, timestamp, terminating institution, locations,\nsystem and version, failure notice, and other related information.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we stated that we intend to implement and evolve the complaint\n\n\n\n\nprocess by building on existing mechanisms, including the process for providing feedback and\nexpressing concerns about health IT that is currently available at\nhttps://www.healthit.gov/healthit-feedback (84 FR 7553). We requested comment on this\napproach and any alternative approaches that would best effectuate this aspect of the Cures\nAct. In addition to any other comments that the public may have wished to submit, we\nspecifically requested comment on several specific questions. The scope of these questions\nwas specific to the information blocking complaint submission process and the information\ncollection necessary to enable effective investigations and safeguard the confidentiality of\ninformation submitted through the complaint process.\n\n*Comments.* We received over 25 comment submissions that included suggestions for\nthe information blocking complaint process. A few commenters responded to one or more of\nthe specific questions in the Proposed Rule, offering suggestions for specific data elements\nthat complainants should be able to enter as part of a complaint. Some commenters suggested\nspecific features such as: a dedicated secure online portal for entry of information blocking\ncomplaints and any supporting documents; a dedicated email box or toll-free phone number\nfor submission of information blocking complaints; the ability to batch multiple instances of\npotential information blocking activity by the same actor into one complaint submission; and a\nuser interface of pick-lists to help submitters more easily categorize their concerns and/or\nmark specific portions of or attachments to their complaints according to their level of\nsensitivity or requested confidentiality. Numerous commenters expressed support for the\nexistence of a publicly available, user-friendly complaint process and recommended that the\ndevelopment and publication of the complaint process include robust educational and\ninformational materials. A few commenters requested an opportunity for public comment on\nthe complaint process’s operational details prior to it going live.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* We note that the complaint process is not required by statute to be\nestablished through rulemaking and we did not intend to give an impression that it would by\nincluding the request for information about the complaint process in the Proposed Rule.\n\nRather, as was the intended outcome, we have received thoughtful suggestions that have\ninformed our initial rollout of the information blocking complaint process as well as have\nprovided considerations for further evolution of the process.\n\nWe have identified several themes and specific suggestions in the comments that we\nwill address below for the purposes of transparency and to inform stakeholders. We have\ndeveloped a dedicated complaint process that is based upon and informed by our experience\nwith our current health IT feedback process and the comments received on the Proposed Rule.\n\nWe also plan to publish informational materials to accompany the rollout of this dedicated\ninformation blocking complaint process so that potential complainants across the affected\nstakeholder categories can successfully use it to submit complaints where they believe they\nhave experienced or observed conduct that constitutes information blocking. While we do not\nanticipate publishing potential operational details of the complaint process and submission\nmechanism in advance of its rollout, we would like to amplify a point we noted in the\nProposed Rule, which is that we intend to implement and evolve the complaint process. After\nwe launch the information blocking complaint process, we anticipate using our own\nexperience and users’ feedback about the information blocking complaint process to identify\nopportunities to further evolve and enhance all aspects of the information blocking complaint\nprocess, including but not limited to its associated informational materials.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that all information blocking complaints be\npublicly posted and available. Conversely, many commenters were in strong support of ONC\nensuring adequate confidentiality for those who submit information blocking complaints.\n\n\n\n\n*Response.* Section 3022(d)(2) of the PHSA exempts from public disclosure “any\ninformation that is received by the National Coordinator in connection with a claim or\nsuggestion of possible information blocking and that could reasonably be expected to facilitate\nidentification of the source of the information” except as may be necessary to carry out the\npurpose of PHSA section 3022. We believe the publishing of complaints could lead to the\nidentification of the source of the information or reasonably facilitate identification of the\nsource; therefore, we do not intend to make complaints publicly available. In specific\nreference to health IT developers of certified health IT, however, we note that we publish in\nthe Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) information about non-conformities with\nProgram requirements, which would include any non-conformities with the Information\nBlocking Condition of Certification requirement. We also note that the information blocking\ncomplaint process offers the option for users to submit anonymously, explaining in multiple\nplaces types of submission information to exclude for those who would like to maintain\nconfidentiality.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters requested that complainants be required to submit\nsufficient evidence of intentional information blocking in the complaint submission process.\n\nAnother commenter suggested complainants be required to meet particular qualifications in\norder to submit a formal complaint.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. However, we do not believe requiring\na complaint submission to include more than the minimum information necessary to\nunderstand the complainant’s concern would best serve the purpose of the complaint process.\n\nWe believe that requiring that a complainant meet a proof, evidentiary, or qualification\nstandard as a pre-requisite to them submitting a complaint would inappropriately discourage\nor prevent many individuals and organizations who are subjected to conduct that may meet the\n\n\n\n\ndefinition of information blocking from sharing their concerns with us.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Section 3022(b)(2)(B) of the PHSA provides that any health care provider determined\nby OIG to have committed information blocking shall be referred to the appropriate agency to\nbe subject to appropriate disincentives using authorities under applicable Federal law, as the\nSecretary sets forth through notice and comment rulemaking. We requested comment on\npotential disincentives and whether modifying disincentives already available under existing\nDepartment programs and regulations would provide for more effective deterrents (84 FR\n7553).\n\nWe also sought information on the implementation of section 3022(d)(4) of the PHSA,\nwhich provides that in carrying out section 3022(d) of the PHSA, the Secretary shall, to the\nextent possible, not duplicate penalty structures that would otherwise apply with respect to\ninformation blocking and the type of individual or entity involved as of the day before\nDecember 13, 2016 – enactment of the Cures Act.\n\n*Comments.* We received over 40 submissions on this RFI. We have organized and\nsummarized the comments by topic below.\n\nNeed for Disincentives\nViews on the need for additional disincentives generally diverged based on stakeholder\ntype. Health care providers were generally opposed to additional disincentives. Provider\norganizations were opposed to any new disincentives. Nearly all these organizations stated\nthat any additional disincentives would be duplicative of disincentives for information\nblocking put in place through the QPP and Promoting Interoperability Programs. In particular,\nhospitals noted concerns that they are already subject to a 75 percent negative adjustment to\ntheir market basket increase if they are unable to make the Medicare Access and CHIP\n\n\n\n\nReauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA)-mandated attestation that they have not engaged in\ninformation blocking. However, a few provider organizations noted that any new disincentives\nwould only be duplicative for providers that are eligible for these specific CMS-administered\nprograms, recognizing that the existing disincentives under Medicare would not reach\nproviders that do not participate in QPP or PI Programs.\n\nMultiple provider organizations stated that additional disincentives would be\nduplicative of fines for HIPAA Rules violations and mentioned that the Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR) has expressed an intent to increase HIPAA Rules enforcement on providers.\n\nA patient-facing app developer commented that the HIPAA Rule’s disincentives,\nattestation, and public reporting are not enough to discourage information blocking.\n\nSeveral health IT developers were neutral on the topic, stating that it was unclear if\nadditional disincentives would duplicate disincentives in other programs.\n\nOne payer, one patient advocacy organization, and one HIN were supportive of\nadditional provider disincentives.\n\nThe HITAC recommended that ONC work with CMS to build information blocking\ndisincentives into a broad range of CMS programs, and that ONC work with other Federal\ndepartments and agencies that contract with providers (e.g., Veterans Health Administration,\nDepartment of Defense Military Health System, Indian Health Service, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention) to similarly build information blocking disincentives into contracting\nand other programs. The HITAC also recommended that providers be required to attest to\ncompliance with requirements to avoid information blocking as part of Conditions of\nParticipation, Conditions for Coverage, contracts, and other similar relationships, covering\nfee-for-service (FFS), value-based care, and direct payment relationships. The HITAC noted\nthat such an attestation requirement could potentially allow for pursuit of serious penalties\n\n\n\n\nshould OIG find the provider engaged in information blocking.\n\nMagnitude of Penalties\nWhile health care providers were generally opposed to disincentives, some did offer\nrecommendations for keeping penalties to a minimum. About half of the provider\norganizations commenting stated that any fines for providers should not be at the same level\nas those levied against health IT developers, HINs, and HIEs. Other provider organizations\nhad more specific recommendations, including a tiered approach to penalties. One provider\norganization recommended a two-tiered approach, with more significant financial penalties for\nlarge hospitals and health systems and public reporting or QPP score reductions for\nphysicians. Another provider organization recommended a tiered approach that mimics the\napproach used under HIPAA (as modified by HITECH), in which penalties increase based on\nthe nature and extent of the violation and resulting harm. Another provider organization\nrecommended that organizations found to engage in information blocking be disqualified from\nthe PI category in QPP.\n\nSome health IT developers recommended significant penalties for providers. Several\nhealth IT developers recommended that ONC work with CMS to utilize and enhance existing\ndisincentive mechanisms, with one developer specifically recommending utilization of the\nConditions of Participation, Conditions for Coverage, and Requirements for Participation. One\napp developer recommended that fines for information blocking be substantial and per record\nblocked. The HITAC stated that fines should be significant enough to discourage problematic\nbehavior, encourage compliance, and incent providers to address and remediate problematic\nbehavior. A payer commented that fines should be consistent with those levied against\ndevelopers, HINs, and HIEs.\n\nEnforcement\n\n\n\n\nMost health care providers and provider organizations recommended that providers be\ngiven the opportunity to become compliant before being subject to any fines, except in\ninstances of clear, egregious violations. Some provider organizations recommended that there\nbe an appeals process for disincentives or findings that health care providers had violated the\ninformation blocking provision, with one organization noting that an appeals process is\nespecially needed for small and rural practices.\n\n*Response.* We have shared all the comments received with the appropriate agencies\nand offices within the Department for consideration in subsequent rulemaking to implement\nsection 3022(b)(2)(B) and (d) of the PHSA.\n\n\n",

This Authorization Guide supports the\nfour use cases defined for Phase 1 of the Argonaut Project. This profile is intended to be used by\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers of apps that need to access FHIR resources by requesting access tokens from OAuth\n2.0 compliant authorization servers. The profile defines a method through which an app requests\nauthorization to access a FHIR resource, and then uses that authorization to retrieve the resource.\n\nOther security mechanisms required by the HIPAA Security Rule, such as end-user\nauthentication, session time-out, security auditing, and accounting of disclosures, are outside the\nscope of this profile.\n\n OpenID Connect Core 1.0 Incorporating Errata Set 1, November 8, 2014\nURL: http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html.\n\nThis is a direct access link.\n\nSummary: OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It\nenables clients to verify the identity of the end user based on the authentication performed by an\nauthorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end user in an\ninteroperable and REST-like manner. This specification defines the core OpenID Connect\nfunctionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of claims to communicate\ninformation about the end user. It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using\nOpenID Connect.\n\nIncorporation by Reference – 45 CFR 170.599\n ISO/IEC 17025:2017(E)-General requirements for the competence of testing and\ncalibration laboratories, (Third Edition), November 2017\nURL: https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html\nThis is a direct access link.

Laboratories that\n\n\n\n\nconform to this document will also operate generally in accordance with the principles of ISO\n9001. This document requires the laboratory to plan and implement actions to address risks and\nopportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the\neffectiveness of the management system, achieving improved results, and preventing negative\neffects. The laboratory is responsible for deciding which risks and opportunities need to be\naddressed. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO/IEC 17025:2005),\nwhich has been technically revised.\n\n ISO/IEC 17065:2012 (E) - Conformity assessment—Requirements for bodies certifying\nproducts, processes and services (First Edition), September 2012\nURL: https://www.iso.org/standard/46568.html\nThis is a direct access link.

We\nexplained in the Proposed Rule that, specifically, 44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)(B)(ii) excludes collection\nactivities during the conduct of administrative actions or investigations involving the agency\nagainst specific individuals or entities.\n\nSecondly, we proposed in 45 CFR 170.402(b)(1) that a health IT developer must, for a\nperiod of 10 years beginning from the date each of a developer’s health IT is first certified under\nthe Program, retain all records and information necessary to demonstrate initial and ongoing\ncompliance with the requirements of the Program for each health IT product. We stated in the\nProposed Rule that it would take approximately two hours per week, on average, to comply with\nour proposed record retention requirement.

The provisions finalized in this rule that could result in monetary costs\nfor stakeholders include the: (1) updates to the 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria; (2)\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for a health IT developer; (3)\noversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements; and (4) information\nblocking.\n\nWhile much of the costs of this final rule will fall on health IT developers that seek to\ncertify health IT under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), we believe the\nimplementation and use of health IT certified to the 2015 Edition (including the new and updated\ncriteria in this final rule), compliance with the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements, and the limited exceptions to information blocking would ultimately result in\nsignificant benefits for health care providers and patients. We outline some of these benefits\nbelow. We emphasize in this regulatory impact analysis (RIA) that we believe this final rule will\n\n\n\n\ncreate opportunities for health IT innovation through new market entrants and remove barriers to\ninteroperability and electronic health information exchange. These efforts would greatly benefit\nhealth care providers and patients by increasing access to important health information and new\ntechnologies resulting in improvements in health care delivery and patient outcomes.\n\nThe provisions in this final rule seek to advance an interoperable health system that\nempowers individuals to use their electronic health information (EHI) to the fullest extent and\nenable health care providers and communities to deliver smarter, safer, and more efficient care.\n\nGiven this goal, there will be instances where the benefits and costs are multifaceted and\nunquantifiable. We note in this RIA when we had difficulty quantifying benefits and costs due to\nlack of applicable research or data. Additionally, there are ongoing regulatory and policy\nactivities outside of this final rule that might influence the rule’s impact in an unquantifiable\nmanner. When possible, we acknowledge these complexities as well. Unquantifiable costs and\nbenefits identified in this rule are summarized in Table 31.\n\n\n",

          "text": "In the Proposed Rule, we noted that we were unable to identify alternatives to our\nproposals that would appropriately implement our responsibilities under the Cures Act and\nsupport interoperability. At the time, we assessed whether there were alternatives to our\nproposals, specifically our proposals concerning EHI export, application programming interfaces\n(APIs), and real world testing. We concluded that our proposals took the necessary steps to fulfill\nthe mandates specified in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as amended by the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and the Cures Act, in\nthe least burdensome way. We welcomed comments on our assessment and any alternatives that\nwe should consider.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We received comments suggesting alternatives to our proposals. Specifically,\nsome commenters stated that we should consider an alternative approach to the EHI export (§\n170.315(b)(10)) certification criterion’s scope to align with other regulations and data standards,\nsuch as the USCDI. Other commenters requested we reconsider the adoption of the consent\nmanagement for APIs (§ 170.315(g)(11)) certification criterion or use a different platform\nbecause the consent2share (C2S) platform was not mature enough. We also received comments\nrequesting we consider alternative definitions for various information blocking terms and\nreconsider our approach to certain information blocking exceptions. Commenters recommended\nthat we consider these alternatives in order to provide clarity to and reduce potential burden for\nthe regulated community.\n\n*Response.* Based on comments received, we considered and adopted revisions to our\nproposals that will substantially reduce real and perceived burden. For the certification criteria,\nwe revised and narrowed the scope of the EHI export certification criterion so that it is more\nmanageable and less administratively burdensome for health IT developers. The criterion will\nlink the data exported to the focused definition of EHI as finalized (see section IV.B.6.c). We\nalso reevaluated and determined, consistent with commenter input, that there is continued work\nto be done to ballot and field test the C2S platform and the Consent Implementation Guide and,\ntherefore, did not adopt the consent management for APIs (§ 170.315(g)(11)) certification\ncriterion in this final rule (see section IV.B.9.b).\n\nWithin the information blocking section, we have focused the scope of many terms to\naddress commenter concerns and reduce potential burden on actors. We have focused the\ndefinition of EHI (§ 171.102) (see VIII.C.3). We have also focused the Health Information\nNetwork (HIN) definition in consideration of comments in four ways. First, we combined the\ndefinitions of HIN and Health Information Exchange (HIE) to create one functional definition that\n\n\n\n\napplies to both statutory terms in order to clarify the types of individuals and entities that would\nbe covered. Second, we limited the types of actions that would be necessary for an actor to meet\nthe definition of HIN or HIE. Third, we have revised the definition to specify that to be a HIN or\nHIE there must be exchange among more than two unaffiliated individuals or entities besides the\nHIN/HIE that are enabled to exchange with each other. Fourth, we focused the definition on\ntreatment, payment, and health care operations, as each are defined in the HIPAA Rules (45 CFR\n164.501) (see VIII.C.2.c). We have also clarified the scope of the “access,” “exchange,” and\n“use” definitions and refer readers to the discussion of those changes in section VIII.C.5.a.\n\nWe have also considered and finalized alternatives relating to the information blocking\nexceptions. Of note, we have finalized the new Content and Manner Exception (see § 171.301\nand the preamble discussion in section VIII.D.2.a), which will significantly reduce burden on\nactors. First, the content condition (§ 171.301(a)) establishes that, in order to satisfy the\nexception, for up to May 2, 2022, an actor must respond to a request to access, exchange, or use\nEHI with, at a minimum, the EHI identified by the data elements represented in the USCDI\nstandard adopted in § 170.213. Second, the manner condition (§ 171.301(b)) explains acceptable\nalternative manners for fulfilling a request to access, exchange, or use EHI when an actor is\ntechnically unable to fulfill a request in any manner requested or cannot reach agreeable terms\nwith the requestor to fulfill the request in any manner requested. This exception creates a\ntransparent and flexible framework for actors to fulfill requests for access, exchange, or use of\nEHI. We refer readers to the discussion of the Content and Manner Exception in section\nVIII.D.2.a, as well as the broader discussion within the information blocking section where we\ndiscuss various other changes we have made in response to comments that will reduce burden\n(see section VIII.D).\n\n\n",

In addition, we have included a summary to meet the regulatory reform analysis\nrequirements under Executive Order 13771.\n\nCost and benefit calculations were performed in 2017 dollars, as this year was the most\nrecent data available to address all cost and benefit estimates consistently. For summary tables\n29 through 31, all estimates are rounded to the nearest dollar and expressed in 2016 dollars to\nmeet regulatory reform analysis requirements under Executive Order 13771.\n\nWe note that estimates presented in the following “Employee Assumptions and Hourly\nWage,” “Quantifying the Estimated Number of Health IT Developers and Products,” and\n\n\n\n\n“Number of End Users that Might Be Impacted by ONC’s Final Rule” sections are used\nthroughout this RIA.\n\nIn this final rule, we used a number of methods to quantify direct and indirect benefits of\nour provisions. For provisions where no such research was available, we developed estimates\nbased on a reasonable proxy. Interoperability, for example, can positively impact patient safety,\ncare coordination, and improve health care processes and health outcomes.192\nHowever,\nachieving interoperability is a function of several factors, not just the capability of the\ntechnology used by health care providers. Therefore, to assess some of the benefits of this final\nrule, we used regression analysis to assess their respective effects on interoperability holding\nother factors constant.\n\nOne example of this approach is the methodology used to quantify the benefits of our real\nworld testing and API provisions on interoperability. We used regression analysis to calculate the\nimpact of our real world testing and API provisions on interoperability. We assumed that the real\nworld testing and API provisions would collectively have the same impact on interoperability as\nupgrading health IT certified to the 2014 Edition. Therefore, we estimated linear probability\nmodels that identified the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’\ninteroperability.193\nWe used data from the 2014 and 2015 American Hospital Association (AHA)\nAnnual Survey Information Technology Supplement (IT Supplement), which consists of an\nanalytic sample of 4,866 observations of non-Federal acute care hospitals that responded to the\nIT Supplement.194\nWe controlled for additional factors such as participation in a health\n192\nhttps://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2017/09/Interoperability_2016-2017_Final_Report.aspx\n193\nThe interoperabilitydependent variable is a binary indicator for whether a hospital routinely sends, receives, and\nintegrates summary of care records electronicallyoutside of its system and finds any health information electronically\noutside of its system.\n\n194\nAmericanHospitalAssociationHealthIT SupplementSurvey,http://www.ahadata.com/aha-healthcare-database/.\n\n\n\n\ninformation exchange organization, hospital characteristics, and urban/rural status. More\nspecifically, we used the following explanatory variables:\nEdition=1 if a hospital adopted 2014 Edition EHR, 0 otherwise\nRHIO=1 if a hospital participates in health information exchange organization, 0\notherwise\nGovernment=1 if a hospital is publicly owned, 0 otherwise\nAlt_teaching=1 if a hospital is teaching, 0 otherwise\nNonprofit=1 if a hospital is not for profit, 0 otherwise\nLargebed=1 if a hospital has more than 399 beds, 0 otherwise\nMedbed=1 if a hospital’s number of beds is between 100 and 399, 0 otherwise\nUrban_rural=1 if a hospital is urban, 0 otherwise\nCAH=1 if a hospital is critical access, 0 otherwise\nYear=year of the data (2014 and 2015)\nS=state fixed effects\nWe found a statistically significant marginal effect of using 2014 Edition certified health IT\nassociated with a five percentage point increase in interoperability.195\nWhile we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits across provisions, we have\ntaken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each provision is unique to the provision\nreferenced. For example, in the case of assessing the impact of our real world testing and API\nprovisions on interoperability, we assumed that the marginal effect is true and distributed the five\npercentage point benefit across our provisions at (0.1-1) to (1-4) percentage points respectively.\n\n195\nResults were similar when we used logit or Probit specifications. Note, the percentage point refers to the arithmetic\ndifference between two percentages.\n\n\n\n\nGiven data limitations, we believe this approach allowed us to estimate the benefits of our final\nprovisions without double counting the impact each provision might have on interoperability.\n\nEmployee Assumptions and Hourly Wage\nWe have made employee assumptions about the level of expertise needed to complete the\nrequirements in this section of the final rule. For wage calculations for Federal employees and\nONC-ACBs, we have correlated the employee’s expertise with the corresponding grade and step\nof an employee classified under the General Schedule (GS) Federal Salary Classification, relying\non the associated employee hourly rates for the Washington, DC locality pay area as published\nby the Office of Personnel Management for 2017.196\nWe have assumed that overhead costs\n(including benefits) are equal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages. Therefore, we have doubled the\nemployee’s hourly wage to account for overhead costs. We have concluded that a 100 percent\nexpenditure on overhead costs which includes benefits is an appropriate estimate based on\nresearch conducted by HHS.197\nWe have used Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data to calculate private sector employee\nwage estimates (e.g., health IT developers, health care providers, health information networks\n(HINs), attorneys, etc.), as we believe BLS provides the most accurate and comprehensive wage\ndata for private sector positions. Just as with the General Schedule Federal Salary Classification\ncalculations, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100 percent\nof pre-tax wages.\n\nWe estimated using 2016 dollars in the Proposed Rule. However, we stated in the\nProposed Rule that we would consider using 2017 and even 2018 dollars, if available, for our\n196\nhttps://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2017/DCB_h.pdf\n197\nSee U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and\nEvaluation (ASPE), Guidelines for Regulatory Impact Analysis, at 28-30 (2016), available at\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/242926/HHS_RIAGuidance.pdf.\n\n\n\n\ncost and benefit estimates in the final rule. Therefore, in this final rule, we updated our estimates\nusing 2017 dollars for the GS Federal Salary Classification and the BLS data.\n\nQuantifying the Estimated Number of Health IT Developers and Products\nWe derived our estimates for the potential impact of the new 2015 criteria on the number\nof certified products in the health IT market. This analysis is based on the number of certified\nhealth IT products (i.e., Health IT Modules), product capability, and the number of health IT\ndevelopers that left, merged, and/or entered the ONC Health IT Certification Program between\nthe 2011 Edition health IT certification criteria (2011 Edition) and the implementation of the\n2014 Edition health IT certification criteria (2014 Edition).198\nIn Table 5, we quantify the extent to which the certified health IT market consolidated\nbetween the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition. We found that the number of health IT developers\ncertifying products between the 2011 Edition and 2014 Edition decreased by 22.1 percent and\nthe number of products available decreased by 23.2 percent.\n\nTable 5: Certified Health IT Market Consolidation from the 2011 Edition to the 2014 Edition\n2011 Edition 2014 Edition Market Consolidation (%)\nHealth IT\nDevelopers\n1,017 792 -22.1%\nProducts\nAvailable\n1,408 1,081 -23.2%\nA\nFor the purposes of these market consolidation calculations, we included the total number of active or suspended\nhealth IT products and their developers. Withdrawn products and their developers were excluded from this total.\n\nUsing the rates identified in Table 5, we then applied our estimate for market\nconsolidation to estimate the number 2015 Edition certified health IT products and health IT\n198\nAvailability of 2014 CEHRT for Meaningful Users Providers, Health IT Policy Committee Data Update (Sept. 9,\n2015), available at http://www.healthit.gov/FACAS/sites/faca/files/HITPC_Data_Update_Presentation_Final_2015-\n09-09.pdf.\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers that would be impacted by our policies in this final rule. Specifically, to estimate the\nnumber of 2015 Edition products and health IT developers in the market, we assumed:\n Products capable of recording EHI will include new certification criteria. We\nassume that products capable of recording patient health data will be the types of\nproducts most likely to be impacted by and include the new certification criteria.\n\n Products capable of recording EHI data available in 2015 equal the number of\nproducts available in 2014. In 2014, there were 710 products by 588 developers\ncapable of recording EHI. Since the new criteria involve the access to and movement\nand exchange of EHI, we used only products that record EHI as a basis for our\nestimates. We believe the 2014 totals reflect a realistic estimate of the currently\navailable products and their developers that could include the new 2015 certification\ncriteria.\n\n Market consolidation rates denoted in Table 5 hold constant. We assume that the\nrate of market consolidation for products (-23.2 percent) and health IT developers (-\n22.1 percent) from the 2011 Edition to the 2014 Edition holds constant for the 2015\nEdition. Although we are using this number to estimate product availability, we are\nunable to assess how market consolidation might impact other production costs such as\nthe supply and demand for personnel over time.\n\nAs shown in Table 6, based on the assumptions, we have estimated the total number of\n2015 products (545) and their developers (458).\n\nTable 6: Total Number of Health IT Developers and Products by Scenario\nScenario Estimated Number\nof Health IT\nDevelopers\nEstimated\nNumber\nof\nProducts\n\n\n\n\n2015 Edition Projection – All Products 617 830\n2015 Edition Projection – Products Capable\nof Recording EHI\n458 545\nNumber of End Users that Might Be Impacted by ONC’s Final Rule\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the population of end users differs according to the\nregulatory action finalized. In many cases, the end-user population impacted is the number of\nhospitals and health care providers that possess certified health IT. Due to data limitations, our\nanalysis regarding the number of hospitals and health care providers impacted by the regulatory\naction is based on the number of hospitals and health care providers that have historically\nparticipated in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR Incentive Programs\n(now Promoting Interoperability (PI) Programs).\n\nOne limitation of this approach is that we are unable to account for the impact of our\nprovisions on users of health IT that were ineligible or did not participate in the CMS EHR\nIncentive Programs. For example, in 2017, 78 percent of home health agencies and 66 percent of\nskilled nursing facilities reported adopting an EHR.199\nNearly half of these facilities reported\nengaging aspects of health information exchange. However, we are unable to quantify,\nspecifically the use of certified health IT products, among these provider types.\n\nDespite these limitations, participants in the CMS EHR Incentive Programs represent an\nadequate sample on which to base our estimates.200\nThere were 439,187 health care providers201\n199\nHenry, J., Pylypchuck, Y., & Patel, V.

We estimate that these entities will be impacted by our rule.\n\nGeneral Comments on the RIA\nComments. Several commenters expressed concern that the estimated costs and developer\nhours in the proposed rule were significantly underestimated. One commenter stated that the cost\nestimates did not accurately reflect provider implementations costs, including those related to\nensuring compliance with the HIPAA Rules, 42 CFR part 2 and other Federal and State privacy\nlaws. Some commenters were concerned about the impact of the requirements, as proposed in the\nProposed Rule, on existing small health IT developers and their ability to compete with large\ndevelopers, as well as the impact on potential new market entrants. One commenter stated that\nthis environment will result in only a small number of health IT developers surviving while also\nlimiting market entry. One commenter expressed concern that the Proposed Rule will provide\nunfettered access to the intellectual property of health IT developers while increasing their\ncompliance costs, which will limit their potential investment returns and create barriers to market\nentry. A few commenters expressed concern that the costs incurred by health IT developers to\nimprove interoperability and comply with other aspects of the rule as proposed will be passed on\nto providers and patients.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input regarding our estimated costs and\ndeveloper hours in the Proposed Rule. We considered and adopted revisions to our proposals\nbased on comments that would substantially reduce any real or perceived burden. We reanalyzed\n201\nThis estimate is the total number of eligible providers that ever participated in the CMS Medicare and Medicaid\nElectronic Health Record Incentive Program.\n\n202\nThis number was estimated based on the de-duplicated number of practices that had at least one clinician\nparticipate in the CMS Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program.\n\n203\nThis estimate is the total number of eligible hospitals that ever participated in the CMS Medicare Electronic\nHealth Record Incentive Program.\n\n\n\n\nour approach and made adjustments for this final rule.

We have also\nincluded additional costs for the bulk data standard support and API support. Lastly, with regards\nto the comment that the cost estimates did not accurately reflect implementation costs to\nproviders, when possible ONC has quantified provider costs associated with the deployment of\nnew certified health IT functionalities and the optional acquisition of emerging API technologies.\n\nCosts that are not quantifiable are noted in Table 31. However, costs related to ensuring\ncompliance with the HIPAA Rules, 42 CFR part 2 and other Federal and State privacy laws, are\nbeyond the scope of the certification criteria and are not included in the final rule.\n\nWe understand commenters’ concerns about the impact of the provisions as proposed on\nsmall health IT developers and the potential impact on new market entrants. However, we\ncontinue to believe that while much of the costs of the final rule will fall on health IT developers\nseeking to certify health IT under the Program, the implementation and use of health IT certified\nto the 2015 Edition (including the updated and new criteria in this final rule), compliance with\nthe Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements, and the limited exceptions to\ninformation blocking would ultimately result in significant benefits for health care providers and\npatients. We also emphasize that we believe the final rule will create opportunities for new\nmarket entrants and will remove barriers to interoperability and electronic health information\nexchange, which will greatly benefit health care providers and patients as well. (1) Deregulatory\nActions\nCosts\nWe do not expect incurred costs to be associated with the deregulatory actions in this\nfinal rule, but rather cost savings as detailed further in this Regulatory Impact Analysis.\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the deregulatory actions of the rulemaking to result in benefits for health IT\ndevelopers, providers, ONC-ACBs, ONC-ATLs, and ONC.\n\n(i) Removal of the Randomized Surveillance Minimum Threshold\nRequirements\nIn this final rule, we have revised § 170.556(c) to specify that ONC-ACBs may conduct\nin-the-field, randomized surveillance. We have removed § 170.556(c)(2), which specifies that\nONC-ACBs must conduct randomized surveillance for a minimum of two percent of certified\nhealth IT products per year. Additionally, we have removed the requirement that ONC-ACBs\nmake a good faith effort to complete randomized surveillance and the circumstances permitted\nfor exclusion from the requirement found in § 170.556(c)(5).\n\nIn the 2015 Edition final rule, we did not independently estimate the costs for randomized\nsurveillance. Rather, we relied on prior regulatory cost estimates for all surveillance actions. One\nof our four ONC-ACBs charges a $3,000 annual fee per product for surveillance due to the new\nrandomized surveillance requirements and to help normalize their revenue stream during down\ncycles between certification editions. Using this fee as a cost basis and assuming it would apply\nto all certified health IT (as opposed to the market-adjusted universe of health IT that is used in\nother calculations in this RIA), we estimated that the removal of the randomized surveillance\n“two percent minimum threshold” requirements will result in cost savings between $6.8 and\n$13.7 million for all stakeholders. To arrive at this estimate, we multiplied the $3000 annual fee\nper product for surveillance by the total number of products certified to the 2014 Edition which\nwas 4,559 products at the time ($3,000*4,559=$13.7 million). We anticipate the number of\nproducts certified for 2014 to decrease to a little as half of the original count over time.\n\nTherefore, we estimated the low end to be half of the $13.7 million (0.5*$13.7 million=$6.8\nmillion). This estimate is based on feedback we received from our ONC-ATLs and ONC-ACBs.\n\n\n\n\nONC-ACBs performed randomized surveillance an average of 22 times the first year the\nrequirement was in effect. The following year surveillance was performed an average of two\ntimes. We cannot predict how many randomized surveillance events the ONC-ACBs will\nperform now that we are not enforcing the requirement. It will be completely at the discretion of\nthe ONC-ACBs.\n\nIn the Proposed Rule, we noted that we considered other potential benefits that we were\nunable to quantify. For instance, we considered that health care provider burden may decrease\nfrom the elimination of the two percent minimum threshold requirements because a provider\nwould previously aid the ONC-ACB in software demonstrations.\n\nWe welcomed comments on potential means, methods, and relevant comparative studies\nand data that we could use to better quantify these benefits.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to the calculation of benefits of the\nelimination of the two percent minimum threshold requirements.\n\n*Response.* We have maintained our approach in calculating the benefits of this\nprovision in this final rule. We believe the removal of the randomized surveillance minimum\nthreshold requirements will reduce the burden on health care providers by reducing their\nexposure to randomized in-the-field surveillance of their health IT products. Health care\nproviders previously expressed concern about the time commitment to support ONC-ACB\nrandomized surveillance of health IT products, particularly if no non-conformities with\ncertified health IT were found. Providers have generally stated that reactive surveillance (e.g.,\ncomplaint-based surveillance) is a more logical and economical approach to surveillance of\nhealth IT products implemented in a health care setting. We also believe the removal of these\nrequirements will provide health IT developers more time to focus on interoperability, and will\n\n\n\n\nprovide ONC-ACBs more time to respond to reactive surveillance, including health care\nprovider complaints about certified health IT.\n\n(ii) Removal of the 2014 Edition from the Code of Federal Regulations\nWe estimate that health IT developers would realize monetary savings from no longer\nsupporting the 2014 Edition certification criteria due to a reduction in activities related to\nmaintaining certification and surveillance. We are aware that one of our ONC-ACBs charges an\ninherited certified status (ICS) fee of $1,000. This fee has been applied over the last calendar\nyear. Over that time period, the number of new, unique 2014 Edition products has been declining\n(24 products, and no new products in the last four months) compared to the number of ICS\ncertifications (569). Just assuming the cost of continued ICS certification, health IT developers\nwould be paying approximately $569,000 each year to keep their 2014 Edition products up to\ndate. Based on recent analysis of the number of unique 2014 Edition products, our assumptions\nhold true.\n\nWe are not aware of comparable fees charged by ONC-ATLs; however, based on our\nexperience with the Program, we expect health IT developers would realize similar cost savings\nassociated with ONC-ATL maintenance of the testing component associated with ICS. Thus, we\nestimate an additional $569,000 cost savings for health IT developers due to the reduced testing\nrequirements.\n\nWe also attempted to identify a potential reduction in maintenance and administrative\ncosts as a result of removing 2014 Edition certification criteria. We could not obtain data to\nconduct a full quantitative analysis specific to the reduction of health IT developer and health\ncare provider costs related to supporting and maintaining the 2014 Edition. However, we invited\ncomments on methods to quantify potential costs for maintaining and supporting products to\nprevious editions.\n\n\n\n\nWe did conduct a review of academic literature and qualitative analysis regarding\npotential savings from no longer supporting the 2014 Edition. We looked at data in IT industry\nsystems as whole, which showed that upgrading outdated legacy systems saves resources\notherwise spent on maintaining compatibilities to multiple systems and also increases quality and\nefficiency.204\nFurthermore, as technology evolves, newer software and products allow for\nsmoother updates compared to their predecessors. Newer products provide better security\nfeatures that can address both new and existing issues. In addition, older software has an\nincreased risk of failure, which, in the health IT industry, increases risk to patient safety.\n\nFrom the implementer’s perspective, the research indicated that retaining legacy\nsystems tends to inhibit scalability and growth for businesses. The perpetuity of outdated\nlegacy systems increases connection and system integration costs and limits the ability to\nrealize increased efficiency through IT implementation. Newer products are developed to\ncurrent specifications and updated standards, which decreases barriers and marginal cost of\nancillary product implementation and increases the accessibility of data in ancillary systems –\nincluding via mobile devices and the latest applications. Finally, office staff in a health care\nsetting would no longer need to be trained to accommodate differing data access needs or\nworkarounds required to integrate to the legacy product.205\nThe research also indicates that retaining legacy software would not be beneficial or\nprofitable to the health IT market. Prolonging backwards compatibility of newer products to\nlegacy systems encourages market fragmentation.206\nWe intend to encourage the health IT\n204\nJames Crotty and Ivan Horrocks, Managing legacy system costs: A case study of a meta-assessment model to\nidentify solutions in a large financial services company, Applied Computing and Informatics (2017), at 1–9.\n\n205\nId.\n\n206\nIl-Horn Hann, Byungwan Koh, and Marius F. Niculescu, The Double-Edged Sword of Backward Compatibility:\nThe Adoption of Multigenerational Platforms in the Presence of Intergenerational Services, Inform. Systems Res.\n\n\n\n\nmarket to keep progressing with a baseline expectation of functionalities that evolve over time.\n\nThis requires limiting fragmentation by no longer supporting outdated or obsolete legacy\nsoftware.207\nWe also estimate that additional savings could be realized by reducing regulatory\ncomplexity and burden caused by having two certification editions. We observed that the task of\nmanaging two different editions within different rules increases complexity and burden for ONC\nstaff, contractors, ONC-ACBs, CMS programs referencing the certification criteria, and other\nstakeholders, as compared to removing the 2014 Edition certification criteria. However, we were\nunable to estimate these benefits because we have no means for quantifying the benefits gained\nfrom only using the 2015 Edition.\n\nWe also expect that health care providers would benefit from removing the 2014 Edition\ncertification criteria because such action would likely motivate health IT developers to certify\nhealth IT products to the 2015 Edition, thus enabling providers to use the most up-to-date and\nsupported systems to care for patients.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specific to our methods for quantifying the\npotential costs for maintaining and supporting products to previous editions.\n\n*Response.* We have maintained our approach for quantifying costs for health IT\ndevelopers maintaining and supporting products to the previous 2014 Edition. We have also\nemphasized again that the research indicates that retaining legacy software would not be\nbeneficial or profitable to the health IT market.\n\n(iii) Removal of the ONC-Approved Accreditor from the ONC Health IT\nCertification Program\n(2016), at 112–30.\n\n207\nId.\n\n\n\n\nWe expect ONC to realize monetary cost savings from removing the ONC-Approved\nAccreditor (ONC-AA) from the Program. We expect ONC to realize costs savings from no\nlonger: (1) developing and publishing a Federal Register Notice and listserv; (2) monitoring the\nopen application period and reviewing and making decisions regarding applications; and (3)\noversight and enforcement of the ONC-AA. We have calculated the estimated annual cost\nsavings for removing the ONC-AA from the Program, taking into consideration that the ONC-\nAA renewed its status every three years.\n\nFor our calculations, we used the estimated hours for collaborating with and informing an\nONC-AA in 2017 (using 2017 wage estimates). We estimated that ONC spent approximately\n110 hours collaborating with the ONC-AA in 2017, which includes (all at the GS-13, Step 1\nlevel): annual assessments; providing appropriate guidance; implementing new requirements and\ninitiatives; and consultations as necessary. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1\nemployee located in Washington, DC is approximately $91. Therefore, we estimated the annual\ncost savings to be $3,337.\n\nWe estimate that ONC would commit approximately eight hours of staff time to develop\nthe Federal Register Notice, which would include approximately: four hours for drafting and\nreview by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level; two hours for review and analysis by senior\ncertification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review and submittal for\npublication by Immediate Office staff at the GS-15, Step 1 level. The hourly wage with benefits\nfor a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $91. The hourly wage\nwith benefits for a GS-14, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $107.\n\nThe hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is\napproximately $126. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $277. Additionally, we\nestimate a cost of $477 to publish each page in the Federal Register, which includes operational\n\n\n\n\ncosts. The Federal Register Notice for ONC-AAs requires, on average, one page in the Federal\nRegister (every three years), so we estimated an additional annual cost savings of $159.\n\nWe estimated that ONC will commit approximately two hours of staff time by an analyst\nat the GS-13, Step 1 level to draft, review, and publish the listserv to announce the Federal\nRegister Notice. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $91. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost savings to be $61.\n\nWe estimated that ONC would commit approximately 25 hours of staff time to manage\nthe open application process, review applications and reach application decisions, which would\ninclude approximately: 20 hours by an analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level; three hours by senior\ncertification staff at the GS-14, Step 1 level; and two hours for review and approval by\nImmediate Office staff at the GS-15, Step 1 level. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13,\nStep 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $91. The hourly wage with\nbenefits for a GS-14, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $107. The\nhourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is\napproximately $126. Therefore, we estimated the annual cost savings to be $798.\n\nTaking all of these potential costs savings into consideration, we estimated the overall\nannual costs savings for removing the ONC-AA from the Program to be $4,632.\n\n(iv) Removal of Certain 2015 Edition Certification Criteria\nIn section III.B.4 of this final rule, we removed the following certification criteria from\nthe 2015 Edition: § 170.315(b)(4) “Common Clinical Data Set summary – create;” (b)(5)\n“Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive” and § 170.315(a)(11) “Smoking status.” We did\nnot finalize the proposal to remove of § 170.315(a)(10) “Drug formulary and preferred drug list\nchecks,” § 170.315(a)(13) “Patient-specific education resources” and § 170.315(e)(2) “Secure\n\n\n\n\nmessaging” but rather will only permit ONC-ACBs to issue certificates for these criteria until\nJanuary 1, 2022 to align with requirements of the CMS Medicaid PI Program.\n\nFor determining calculations for the majority of the 2015 Edition certification criteria we\nremoved, we used the following assumptions. (For the removal of § 170.315(b)(4) Common\nClinical Data Set summary – create and (b)(5) Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive,\nwe outlined the slightly different approach used).\n\nIn the 2015 Edition final rule, we estimated the costs for developing and preparing health\nIT to meet the 2015 Edition certification criteria. The development and preparation costs we\nestimated were derived through a health IT developer per criterion cost. We estimated the\ndevelopment and preparation costs over a four-year period, and we projected the costs would be\nunevenly distributed. In figuring out the cost savings for the deregulatory actions, we initially\nused the distribution from the 2015 Edition, but then adjusted the percentages of development\nand preparation costs due to current empirical and anecdotal evidence. The distribution was\nreevaluated to account for 2019 and we estimated the actual development and preparation\ndistribution for 2018 to be 35 percent and for 2019 to be 15 percent. We took the average\ndevelopment and preparation cost estimates (low and high) per criterion from Table 14 of the\n2015 Edition final rule (80 FR 62737). We then used our new distribution to identify the cost per\nyear for years 2018 and 2019. We took the total estimated costs for 2018 and 2019 and divided\nthat by 12 to determine the cost savings per month and took a range of 6 to12 months. Based on\nanalysis of recent data, our assumptions continue to hold true.\n\nTo determine the testing costs of the deregulatory actions, we took the number of health\nIT developers who develop products for certification for the identified criteria from the 2015\nEdition final rule and then figured out the average cost per criterion. Based on the costs that one\nof the ONC-ATLs charges for testing, we estimated the average cost for testing per criterion and\n\n\n\n\ndetermined subsequent cost savings. In 2017, only about five to ten percent of products have\nbeen tested and certified compared to the number of certified 2014 Edition products. Therefore,\nup to 90 to 95 percent of products remain to be tested and certified to the 2015 Edition. Based on\nanalysis of recent data, our assumptions continue to hold true.\n\nWe estimated the total cost savings by multiplying the number of health IT developers\nwho developed products for certification to a certain criterion by the estimated cost per criterion,\n$475. We then took five percent of that number to identify the high end for the cost savings. We\nthen took 10 percent to identify the low end. The five percent was derived from looking at the\nnumber of unique developers who have at least one active 2014 Edition product and the number\nof unique developers who have at least one active 2015 Edition. The denominator is the number\nof unique developers who have at least one active 2014 Edition product, which is 793. The\nnumerator is the number of unique developers who have at least one active 2015 Edition product\nand one active 2014 edition product, which is 41. (41/793=0.0517024 or 5 percent).\n\n(A) Common Clinical Data Set Summary Record Criteria\nIn this final rule, we removed the Common Clinical Data Set summary – create (§\n170.315(b)(4)) and Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive (§ 170.315 (b)(5)) criteria.\n\nOur expectation was for ONC to realize cost savings associated with internal\ninfrastructure support and maintenance, which would include actions such as: (1) developing and\nmaintaining information regarding these criteria on the ONC website; (2) creating documents\nrelated to these criteria and making those documents 508 compliant; (3) updating, revising, and\nsupporting Certification Companion Guides, test procedures, and test tools; and (4) responding to\ninquiries concerning these criteria. Based on ONC data on the number of inquiries received since\nearly 2016, we estimated approximately 12 annual inquiries about § 170.315(b)(4) and (5)\nrespectively, (24 total inquiries for two criteria). We estimate it will take an analyst at the GS-13,\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 level an average of two hours to conduct all tasks associated with each inquiry. The\nhourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is\napproximately $91. Based on analysis of recent data, our assumptions continue to hold true.\n\nTherefore, we estimated the annual cost savings to be $4,360.\n\nWe do not expect cost savings associated with software maintenance because both\ncriteria incorporate the Common Clinical Data Set and essentially the same data input and\nvalidation requirements as the transitions of care criterion (§ 170.315(b)(1)). The removal of\nthese two criteria would not affect the test data and software maintenance costs, as the same test\ndata and software validation elements remain in § 170.315(b)(1) and the Common Clinical Data\nSet used in other criteria.\n\nONC-ACBs could realize minimal savings, as they would need to conduct slightly less\nsurveillance based on the two products that are currently certified to these criteria. We estimated\nthe overall annual costs savings for removing the Common Clinical Data Set summary record\ncertification criteria from the 2015 Edition to be $4,368.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specific to the removal of the Common Clinical\nData Set summary – create (§ 170.315(b)(4)) and Common Clinical Data Set summary – receive\n(§ 170.315 (b)(5)) criteria.\n\n*Response.* We maintained our approach and estimates for removing the Common Clinical\nData Set summary record certification criteria from the 2015 Edition. However, we did update\nestimates to 2017 dollars.\n\n(B) Smoking Status\nIn this final rule, we removed the 2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion (§\n170.315(a)(11)), which would include removing it from the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition.\n\nTo calculate the cost savings for removing this criterion, we used the 2015 Edition estimated\n\n\n\n\ncosts of developing and preparing the criterion to the 2015 Edition, between $15,750 and\n$31,500 and estimated that 35 percent of developers would be newly certified in 2018 and 15\npercent in 2019. We estimated the cost of development and preparation costs to be between\n$5,512.50 and $11,025 for 2018 and $2,362.50 and $4,725 for 2019. We calculated the cost per\nmonth for years 2018 and 2019 and using the high point estimates, estimated the development\nand preparation costs over a 6 to 12 month period between August 2018 and August 2019. We\nestimated the costs to be between $4,068.75 at six months and $6,825 at 12 months. Based on\nanalysis of recent data, our assumptions continue to hold true.\n\nTo calculate the cost for testing for this criterion, five developers were estimated in the\n2015 Edition to develop products to this criterion. We multiplied the five developers by our\nestimated cost to test per criterion of $475. This estimated cost per criterion was based on what\none ONC-ATL charged for testing and averaged per criterion. To be conservative, we reduced\nthe number by ten percent and five percent respectively resulting in $2,137.50 and $2,256.25.\n\nTaking these estimated costs into account we expect the cost savings for removing the\n2015 Edition “smoking status” criterion to be between $8,962.50 and $9,081.25.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specific to the removal of the 2015 Edition\n“smoking status” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(11)).\n\n*Response.* We maintain our approach and estimates for removing the 2015 Edition\n“smoking status” criterion (§ 170.315(a)(11)) from the 2015 Edition. However, we did update\nestimates to 2017 dollars.\n\n(v) Removal of Certain Certification Requirements\nIn this final rule, we removed § 170.523(k)(1)(iii)(B), which requires ONC-ACBs to\nensure that certified health IT includes a detailed description of all known material information\nconcerning limitations that a user may encounter in the course of implementing and using the\n\n\n\n\ncertified health IT, whether to meet “meaningful use” objectives and measures or to achieve any\nother use within the scope of the health IT’s certification. We also removed §\n170.523(k)(1)(iv)(B) and (C), which state that the types of information required to be disclosed\ninclude, but are not limited to: (B) limitations, whether by contract or otherwise, on the use of\nany capability to which technology is certified for any purpose within the scope of the\ntechnology’s certification; or in connection with any data generated in the course of using any\ncapability to which health IT is certified; (C) limitations, including, but not limited to, technical\nor practical limitations of technology or its capabilities, that could prevent or impair the\nsuccessful implementation, configuration, customization, maintenance, support, or use of any\ncapabilities to which technology is certified; or that could prevent or limit the use, exchange, or\nportability of any data generated in the course of using any capability to which technology is\ncertified.\n\nTo calculate the savings related to removing these two disclosure requirements, we\nestimated 830 products certified to the 2015 Edition. We did so by applying the market\nconsolidation rate of -23.2 percent which was the rate observed between 2011 and 2014 Editions.\n\nIf an ONC-ACB spends 1 hour on average reviewing costs, limitations and mandatory\ndisclosures, we estimated the time saved by no longer having to review the limitations to be two-\nthirds of an hour. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $91 and we assume this to be the hourly rate for an ONC-\nACB reviewer. We multiplied 830, the projected number of certified products, by two-thirds of\nan hour and the assumed hourly rate and calculated the cost savings to be $50,353.\n\n(2) Updates to the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria\nThe following section details the costs and benefits for updates to the 2015 Edition health\nIT certification criteria, which includes costs and benefits to update certain 2015 Edition criteria\n\n\n\n\nto due to the adoption of the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) as a standard,\nand costs for new or revised 2015 Edition criteria for: EHI export, API, privacy and security\ntransparency attestations, and security tags.\n\n(i) United States Core Data for Interoperability\nIn order to advance interoperability by ensuring compliance with new structured data and\ncode sets that support the data, we have replaced the “Common Clinical Data Set” (CCDS)\ndefinition and its references with the “United States Core Data for Interoperability” (USCDI)\nstandard, naming Version 1 (v1) in § 170.213 and incorporated it by reference in § 170.299. The\nUSCDI will replace the CCDS 24 months after the publication date of this final rule. The USCDI\nv1 establishes a minimum set of data classes (including structured data) that are required for\nhealth IT to be interoperable nationwide and is designed to be expanded in an iterative and\npredictable way over time.\n\nThe USCDI v1 adds three new data classes, “Allergies and Intolerances,” “Clinical\nNotes,” and “Provenance;” and adds to “Patient Demographics” the data elements “Previous\nAddress,” “Phone Number,” “Phone Number Type,” and “Email Address” that were not defined\nin the CCDS. This requires updates to the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-\nCDA) standard and updates to the following certification criteria: § 170.315(b)(1) (transitions of\ncare); (e)(1) (view, download, and transmit to 3rd\nparty); (g)(6) (Consolidated CDA creation\nperformance); (f)(5) (transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting); and\n(g)(9) (application access – all data request). From our analysis of the C-CDA standard, we\nconcluded that the requirements of the “Provenance” data class are already met by the existing\nC-CDA standard and will not require any new development. Therefore, we have estimated the\ncost to health IT developers to add support for “Allergies and Intolerances” and “Clinical Notes”\ndata classes and “Previous Address,” “Phone Number,” “Phone Number Type,” and “Email\n\n\n\n\nAddress” data elements in C-CDA, and the necessary updates to the affected certification\ncriteria. These estimates are detailed in Table 7 and are based on the following assumptions:\n Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data models. Table 7 shows\nthe estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop support for the\nadditional USCDI data element in the C-CDA standard and affected certification criteria.\n\nWe recognize that health IT developer costs will vary; however, our estimates in this\nsection assume all health IT developers will incur the costs noted in Table 7.\n\n A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified health IT\nproducts. As the 2015 Edition certification is ongoing, using the current count of\ndevelopers and products would underestimate the overall costs and benefits, so we\ntherefore use a proxy. We estimate that 545 products from 458 developers will be\naffected. Our proxy is based on the number of 2014 Edition certified health IT products\nthat are capable of recording patient data.208\nThere were 710 products by 588 developers\nwith at least one 2014 Edition product capable of recording patient data. We then\nmultiplied these numbers by our certified health IT market consolidation estimates of -\n22.1 percent and -23.2 percent to project the number of 2015 developers and products,\nrespectively.\n\n According to the May 2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly\nwage for a “Software Developer” is $53.74.209\nTable 7: Costs to Health IT Developers to Develop Support for the Additional USCDI Data Element\nin C-CDA Standard and Affected Certification Criteria\n(2017 Dollars)\n208\nWe defined “products capable of recording patient data” as any 2014 Edition health IT product that was certified\nfor at least one of the following criteria: Demographics ((a)(5)), Medication List ((a)(7)), Medication Allergy List\n((a)(8)), Problem List ((a)(6)), and Family Health History ((a)(12)).\n\n209\nSee “software developer, systems software” - https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes151133.htm\n\n\n\n\nTasks Details\nLower\nBound\nHours\nUpper\nBound\nHours Remarks\nUpdate C-CDA\ncreation\nNew development to\nsupport “Allergies and\nIntolerances,” “Clinical\nNotes,” “Previous\nAddress,” “Phone\nNumber,” “Phone Number\nType,” and “Email\nAddress” for C-CDA and\nC-CDA 2.1 Companion\nGuide\n1,200 2,400\n(1) Lower bound assumes\nhealth IT already has\ndeveloped C-CDA R2.1 into\ntheir system and only needs\nto be updated for new data\nelements.\n\n(2) Upper bound estimates\neffort for organizations that\nare on older versions of C-\nCDA standard, for example\nC-CDA R1.1.\n\n§ 170.315(b)(1)\n(transitions of\ncare)\nNew development to\nsupport “Allergies and\nIntolerances,” “Clinical\nNotes,” “Previous\nAddress,” “Phone\nNumber,” “Phone Number\nType,” and “Email\nAddress” for C-CDA and\nC-CDA 2.1 Companion\nGuide\n200 600\nNecessary updates to health\nIT to support the new data\nclass to meet the criteria\nrequirements.\n\n§ 170.315(e)(1)\n(view,\ndownload, and\ntransmit to 3rd\nparty)\nNew development to\nsupport “Allergies and\nIntolerances,” “Clinical\nNotes,” “Previous\nAddress,” “Phone\nNumber,” “Phone Number\nType,” and “Email\nAddress” for C-CDA and\nC-CDA 2.1 Companion\nGuide\n400 1,000\nNecessary updates to health\nIT to support the new data\nclass to meet the criteria\nrequirements.\n\n§ 170.315(g)(6)\n(Consolidated\nCDA creation\nperformance)\nNew development to\nsupport “Allergies and\nIntolerances,” “Clinical\nNotes,” “Previous\nAddress,” “Phone\nNumber,” “Phone Number\nType,” and “Email\nAddress” for C-CDA and\nC-CDA 2.1 Companion\nGuide\n200 600\n170.315(b)(1) and §\n170.315(g)(6) are related and\nmay be developed together.\n\nTotal Hours 2,000 4,600\nHourly Rate $107\nCost per Product $214,000 $492,200\n\n\n\n\nTotal Cost (545\nproducts)\n$116.6\nmillion\n$268.2\nmillion\nWe estimated that the cost to a health IT developer to develop support for the additional\nUSCDI data elements would range $214,000 to $492,200. Therefore, assuming 545 products, we\nestimate that the total annual cost to all health IT developers would, on average, range from\n$116.6 million to $268.2 million. This would be a one-time cost to developers per product that is\ncertified to the specified certification criteria and would not be perpetual.\n\nWe believe this would benefit health care providers, patients, and the industry as a whole.\n\nClinical notes and provenance were included in the draft USCDI v1 based on significant\nfeedback from the industry, which highly regarded their desirability as part of interoperable\nexchanges. The free text portion of the clinical notes was most often relayed by clinicians as the\ndata they sought, but were often missing during electronic health information exchange.\n\nSimilarly, the provenance of data was also referenced by stakeholders as a fundamental need to\nimprove the trustworthiness and reliability of the data being exchanged.\n\nWe expect improvements to interoperable exchange of information and data provenance\nto significantly benefit providers and patients. For example, in 2018, among individuals who had\nviewed their online medical record within the past year (representing 30 percent nationally),\nabout half indicated that clinical notes were included in their online medical record.210\nAdditionally, seven percent of individuals who viewed their online medical record requested a\ncorrection of inaccurate information. Thus, enabling patients to have access to their clinical notes\nmight assist in reducing medical coding errors.\n\n210\nPatel V & Johnson C. (May 2019).

In 2017, 36 percent of non-Federal acute\ncare hospitals reported difficulty matching or identifying the correct patient between systems.211\nThe data elements “Previous Address,” “Phone Number,” “Phone Number Type,” and “Email\nAddress” were included in the USCDI v1 based on feedback from industry, for their usage in\naccurate patient matching.\n\nHowever, we are not aware of an approach for quantifying these benefits and we\nwelcomed comments on potential approaches to quantifying these benefits in the Proposed Rule.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments regarding an approach to quantify benefits.\n\nHowever, we did receive comment regarding estimation of the time and effort on behalf of health\nIT developers to update to the USCDI. Commenters stated that we have underestimated the\nnumber of hours necessary for health IT developers, suggesting that it is triple our estimates.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We maintain the approach we proposed\nin the Proposed Rule in regard to our estimates for updating the USCDI. This final rule\nconstrains “provenance” to only the scope of data for which the health IT developer is the\nowner/steward. Hence, the scope is fairly limited and therefore, we believe our estimates to be\naccurate. We note the removal of “data export” (§ 170.315(b)(6)) from the cost estimate in Table\n6, in alignment with our final policy decisions and no longer updating the criterion to USCDI.\n\nWe did, however, increase the hour per developer based on additional data elements included in\nthis final rule.\n\n(ii) Electronic Health Information Export\n211\nPylypchuk Y., Johnson C., Henry J. & Ciricean D. (November 2018). Variation in Interoperability among U.S.\n\nNon-Federal Acute Care Hospitals in 2017. ONC Data Brief, no.42. Office of the National Coordinator for Health\nInformation Technology: Washington DC.\n\n\n\n\nIn this final rule, we adopted a modified version of the “EHI export” criterion in §\n170.315(b)(10). Notably, we have defined and further constrained the criterion’s scope of data\nfor export as EHI, as defined in § 171.102, that can be stored at the time of certification by the\nproduct, of which the Health IT Module is a part. The final criterion provides a focused set of\ndata from a scope perspective and clarifies what a product with a certified Health IT Module\nmust be capable of exporting. The intent of this criterion aims to provide Health IT Module users\nthe functionality to efficiently export or direct the export of EHI for a single patient or a patient\npopulation in a computable, electronic format.\n\n(A) Costs to Develop and Maintain EHI Export Criterion\nThis section describes the estimated costs of the “EHI export” criterion. The cost\nestimates are based on the following assumptions:\n Health IT developers will use the same labor costs and data models. Table 8 shows\nthe estimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop and maintain\nthe EHI export functionality. We recognize that health IT developer costs will vary;\nhowever, our estimates in this section assume all health IT developers will incur the costs\nnoted in Table 8.\n\n A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified health IT\nproducts containing the “EHI export” criterion. We estimated that 545 products from\n458 developers will contain the “EHI export” criterion. To develop these estimates, we\nfirst identified a proxy for the number of health IT developers that may create a 2015\nEdition certified health IT product containing the “EHI export” criterion. Our proxy is\nbased on the number of 2014 Edition certified health IT products that are capable of\n\n\n\n\nrecording patient data.212\nWe based our estimates on these products because data must be\ncaptured to be exported under the adopted criterion. There were 710 products by 588\ndevelopers with at least one 2014 Edition product capable of recording patient data. We\nthen multiplied these numbers by our certified health IT market consolidation estimates\nof -22.1 percent and -23.2 percent to project the number of 2015 developers and products,\nrespectively.\n\n Wages are determined using BLS estimates. According to the May 2017 BLS\noccupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a “Software Developer” is\n$53.74.213\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits)\nare equal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is\n$107.\n\n212\nWe defined “products capable of recording patient data” as any 2014 Edition product that was certified for at least\none of the following criteria: Demographics ((a)(5)), Medication List ((a)(7)), Medication Allergy List ((a)(8)),\nProblem List ((a)(6)), and FamilyHealth History((a)(12)).\n\n213\nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes151133.htm\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Estimated Labor Costs to Develop and Maintain the EHI Export Criterion per\nProduct\nActivity Lower Bound\nHours\nUpper Bound\nHours\nRemarks\nTask 1:\nDeveloping the\nData Dictionary\nsoftware capability\nto export EHI in a\ndeveloper format\n(per product)\n160 hours 1,600 hours\nThis is the effort to document all the data\nexported by the product for a single patient\nand for all patients.\n\nThe lower bound assumes that the health IT\ndeveloper already has a standard format in\nwhich they are exporting the data for either\ncase (e.g., C-CDA for single patient, CSV file\nor database dump for all data) and the effort is\nmerely to publish it to the users. On the other\nhand, the upper bound reflects the case where\nthe health IT has to develop the export\ncapability de novo into their product and\ndocument the data output. This still assumes\nthat the developer will be able to use the\nformat of their choice.\n\nNote: This is a one-time cost to develop the\nexport capability\nTask 2: Updating\nthe Data\nDictionary and\npublishing the\nupdated format.\n\n(per product)\n80 hours 500 hours\nThis is the maintenance cost to update the\ndata dictionary published by the product to\nensure that the data dictionary is\ncompatible with newer releases of the\nproduct. The lower bound estimate\nassumes the effort when there are only\nminor changes to the formats of the data\nstored by the product. The upper bound\nestimate assumes the effort when the\nproduct makes substantial changes to the\nformats of the data.\n\nTask 3: Updating\nthe software that\nperforms EHI\nExport (per\nproduct)\n80 hours 500 hours\nThis is the maintenance cost to upgrade\nthe software that would generate the EHI\nexport files. The lower bound estimates the\ncost to maintain the software when there\nare only minor changes to the product,\nincluding updates to underlying software\n(e.g., database versions, operating systems,\netc.). The upper bound estimate accounts\nfor substantial reworking of the export\nsoftware program to export in new formats\nor based on substantial changes made to\nthe underlying storage system.\n\nTotal Labor Hours 320 hours 2,600 hours\n\n\n\n\n(B) Costs to Implement and Support the EHI Export\nCriterion\nThe cost estimates are based on the following assumptions:\n Health care providers will use the same costs and data models. Table 11 shows the\nestimated costs to implement and support the EHI Export criterion. The cost estimates used\nin this calculation were published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and\nwere based on the average cost to implement an EHR for a clinical practice.214\nThis\n214\nFleming, N., Impact of Health Information Technology on Primary Care Workflow and Financial Measures\nAHRQ Publication No. 11-0081-4-EF, October 2011\nhttps://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/page/Fleming_SS_508_20111021_d.pdf\nTable 9: Example Calculation for the Lower Bound Estimated Cost to Health IT Developers to\nPerform Task 1 for the EHI Export Criterion\n(2017 Dollars)\nActivity Estimated Labor Hours\nLower Bound\nDeveloper Salary Projected Products\nTask 1 160 hours $107 per hour 545 products\nExample Calculation\n160 hours * $107 * 545 products = $9,330,400\nTable 10: Total Cost to Develop and Maintain the EHI Export Criterion (2017 Dollars)\nActivity Estimated Cost\nLower Bound Upper Bound\nTask 1 (545 products) $9,330,400 $93,304,000\nTask 2 (545 products) $4,665,200 $29,157,500\nTask 3 (545 products) $4,665,200 $29,157,500\nTotal (545 products) $18,660,800 $151,619,000\n\n\n\n\npublication was based on the implementation of an entire EHR system. We assume that all\nstakeholders impacted by this rule will already have a base EHR system implemented,\ntherefore we discounted these estimates by a factor of 10 to better reflect the cost to\nimplement an EHI Export module only. We did not have cost estimates for hospitals.\n\nTherefore, to estimate the cost for a hospital to implement an EHR system, we multiplied the\nestimate to implement an EHR for a clinical practice by a factor of 10. We believe this will\nbetter reflect the increased magnitude and complexity of implementing and supporting a new\nhealth IT module in a hospital compared to a clinical practice. We recognize that costs health\ncare providers incur will vary; our estimates in this section assume health care providers\nincur the costs noted in Table 11.\n\n Hospitals and clinical practices that have participated in the CMS EHR Incentive\nProgram will be impacted. We estimate that 95,470 clinical practices215\nand 4,519\nhospitals216\nwill be impacted by our rule.\n\nTable 11: Estimated cost to hospitals and clinical practices to implement and support the EHI Export\nCriterion\n(2017 Dollars)\nCost Per Entity\nTask Entity Type\nNumber of\nEntities\nLower\nBound\nUpper\nBound Remarks\nTask 1:\nImplementation\nand Support\nClinical\nPractices 95,470 $2,000 $4,000\nThis task would involve costs\nassociated with staff support\nduring implementation,\nworkflow mapping and\nredesign, content development\n215\nThis number was estimated based on the de-duplicated number of practices that had at least one clinician\nparticipate in the CMS Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program.\n\n216\nThis estimate is the total number of eligible hospitals that ever participated in the CMS Medicare Electronic\nHealth Record Incentive Program.\n\n\n\n\nHospitals 4,519 $20,000 $40,000\nand customization, project\nmanagement, and other\ntechnical deployment\nincluding networking.\n\nTask 2: Staff\nTraining\nClinical\nPractices 95,470 $500 $1,000\nThis task would involve staff\ntraining for implementation\nteams and staff end users.\n\nHospitals 4,519 $5,000 $10,000\nTable 12: Total cost to implement and support the EHI Export Criterion\n(2017 Dollars)\nTask Lower Bound Upper Bound\nTask 1: Implementation\nand Support\nClinical\nPractices $190,940,000 $381,880,000\nHospitals $90,380,000 $180,760,000\nTask 2: Staff Training\nClinical\nPractices $47,735,000 $95,470,000\nHospitals $22,595,000 $45,190,000\nTotal Cost $351,650,000 $703,300,000\nBased on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in Tables 8 and 10, the total estimated\ncost for health IT developers to develop products to the “EHI export” criterion will range from\n$18.7 million to $151.6 million. Assuming 458 health IT developers, there would be an average\ncost per health IT developer ranging from $40,744 to $331,045. We note that the development\ncosts, which equal half of the total, would be a one-time cost and would not be perpetual. The\ntotal estimated cost for hospitals and clinical practices to implement and support the EHI Export\nwill range from $351.7 million to $703.3 million. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the\nprimary estimate of costs.\n\n(C) Benefits\nHealth care providers may choose to change their EHRs for a number of reasons.\n\nHowever, the steps and costs associated with switching one’s EHR are complex. Market forces,\n\n\n\n\nsuch as health IT developers’ business incentives, make it difficult and costly for EHR users to\ntransfer system data from one developer to another. Data transfer costs vary depending on how\ncontracts are structured.217\nSpecifically, contracts might include high data-transfer fees or do not\ninclude conditions for data transfer. Providers may also pay fees for consultants or technical staff\nto help with the data-transfer process given differences in how data may be mapped from one\ndeveloper to another. Hence, health care providers will experience benefits associated with the\nstandardization proposed in the EHI export functionality.\n\nBecause of the EHI export functionality, providers will no longer incur the costs\nassociated with mapping data from their health IT database into standard terms or exporting said\ndata using a standardized format when switching EHRs. In our analysis, we calculated the\nbenefits in terms of the reduced costs to providers as a result of our rule eliminating these two\ntasks. The benefit calculations below are based on the following assumptions:\n On average, five percent of providers and hospitals switch their health IT\nannually. Using CMS Medicare EHR Incentive Program data from years 2013-2016,\nwe estimate the rate of providers (hospitals and eligible professionals) that changed\ntheir health IT developer. We believe that the EHI export functionality would help\nalleviate the burden of switching between health IT systems by increasing portability\nof EHI that can be stored at the time of certification by the product, of which the\nHealth IT Module is a part. Thus, the benefit calculations are based on assumptions\nregarding the number of clinical practices (n = 4,774) and hospitals (n = 226) that are\nprojected to switch products in a year.\n\n217\nPratt, Mary, The True Cost of Switching EHRs, Medical Economics, May 30, 2018, Volume: 96 Issue: 10\n\n\n\n\n Health IT consultants218\nwill use the same labor costs and data models. Table 13\nshows the estimated labor costs per product for a hospital or health care provider to\nhire a health IT consultant to perform data export of EHI, as defined in 45 CFR\n171.102, without the EHI export functionality. We recognize that these costs will vary\nbased on the size of the hospital or clinical practice.\n\n Wages are determined using BLS estimates. According to the May 2017 BLS\noccupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a “Software Developer”\nis $53.74.219\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including\nbenefits) are equal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including\noverhead costs is $107.\n\nTable 13: Cost per Provider to Perform Data Export without EHI Export Functionality When\nSwitching Health IT Products(2017 Dollars)\nActivity Estimated Cost per\nHealth IT Switch\n(Lower bound)\nEstimated Cost per\nHealth IT Switch\n(Upper bound)\nRemarks\nTask 1:\nUnderstanding\nand mapping the\ndata in health IT\ndatabase into\nstandard terms\n320 hours 3,200 hours\nThe lower bound is an estimate for\na small provider practice using the\nstandard instance of a certified\nhealth IT product with no\ncustomization and use of nationally\nrecognized content standards.

The upper bound\nestimates the case where a large\namount of data is not easily\nexported by the certified health IT\nproduct and therefore substantial\none-off software needs to be\nwritten to export the data into a\ncustom (de novo) format\ndeveloped for the transition.\n\nTotal Labor\nHours 480 hours 4,800 hours\nTable 14 provides an example calculation for how we calculated our total costs presented in Table\n15.\n\nTable 14: Example Calculation for the Lower Bound Estimated Cost to Providers to Hire a Health\nIT Consultant to Perform Task 1 without the EHI Export Criterion(2017 Dollars)\nActivity Estimated Labor Hours\nLower Bound\nDeveloper Salary Estimated Annual\nNumber of Health\nIT Switches\nTask 1 320 hours $107 per hour 5,000 switches\nExample Calculation\n320 hours * $107 * 5000 switches = $171,200,000\nTable 15: Total Cost to Providers to Perform Data Export without the EHI Export Criterion\nwhen Switching Health IT Products(2017 Dollars)\nActivity Estimated Cost\nLower Bound Upper Bound\nTask 1 $171,200,000 $1,712,000,000\nTask 2 $85,600,000 $856,000,000\nTotal Cost Savings (5,000 switches) $256,800,000 $2,568,000,000\nWe multiplied the costs to switch health IT by the estimated number of hospitals and\nclinical practices affected. Thus the estimated annual benefit, in terms of cost savings to hospitals\nand clinical practices, would range from $256.8 million to $2.6 billion.\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Application Programming Interfaces\nThe API requirements in this final rule reflect the full depth and scope of what we believe\nis necessary to implement the API Condition of Certification requirement described in section\n4002 of the Cures Act. We have adopted new standards, new implementation specifications, a\nnew certification criterion, and detailed Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements in §§ 170.213 and 170.215, 170.315, and 170.404, respectively. We also\nmodified the Base EHR definition in § 170.201.\n\n(A) Costs to Develop and Maintain Certified API\nTechnology\nThis section describes the potential costs of the API certification criterion. The cost\nestimates below are based on the following assumptions:\n Health IT developers will use labor costs and data models based on whether they have\nadopted aspects of the API certification criterion. Tables 16 A and 16 B show the\nestimated labor costs per product for a health IT developer to develop and maintain an API.\n\nWe recognize that health IT developer costs will vary based on whether they have already\nimplemented aspects of the API certification criterion; including adopting the Fast\nHealthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) API. To account for this variation, we have\nestimated two cost tables. Table 16 A reflects the range of costs incurred for new products or\nthose developers that have not previously certified to the API certification criteria. Table 16\nB shows the cost for developers that have already implemented the API criteria. We have\nassumed in our calculations that all health IT developers will incur costs noted in either Table\n16 A or Table 16 B.\n\n A proxy is needed to project the number of 2015 Edition certified health IT products\ncontaining the API certification criterion. We estimated that 459 products from 394\n\n\n\n\ndevelopers will contain the API criterion. We used a proxy to determine the number of health\nIT developers that may develop an API for the certification to the 2015 Edition. There were\n598 products and 506 developers with at least one 2014 Edition certified health IT product\nthat could perform transitions of care. We then multiplied this number by our certified health\nIT market consolidation estimates of -22.1 percent and -23.2 percent to project the number of\n2015 developers and products, respectively. Some developers and products are already\nleveraging aspects of the API certification criterion. This could reduce their cost to\nimplement the criterion. To determine the number of developers and products applicable to\ncost Table 16 A or 16 B, we calculated the proportion of products and developers that have\nalready certified to API certification criterion. We then applied this estimate to the projected\nnumber of 2015 Edition certified health IT products. Specifically, we estimate that 50 percent\nof products (230) and 55 percent of developers (217) will incur costs reflected in Table 16 A\nbecause they have no prior experience with certifying to the API criteria. We believe this\nestimate serves as a reasonable proxy for products’ capability to send patient data and the\ncost of implementation. The API functionality required by the 2015 Edition achieves a\nsimilar end by allowing providers to retrieve patient data from secure data servers hosted by\nother developers, as well as providing patients access to their medical records through third-\nparty applications connected to these same secure servers.\n\n Wages are determined using BLS estimates.

Software applications that connect\nto APIs is an emerging market that we believe will be further enhanced by the standards,\ntransparency, and pro-competitive requirements finalized in this rule. As of October 25, 2018,\nresearchers identified nearly 300 software applications being marketed on EHR vendors’ app\nstores. The majority of these applications are designed for health care providers to help support\nuse cases for population health analytics, clinical decision support, patient education, as well as\nto conduct administrative and financial tasks.221\nAlthough not required under this rule, this\nsection describes the potential costs of health care providers to acquire and use new software\napplications that interact with certified API technology. The cost estimates are based on the\nfollowing assumptions:\n Health care providers will use the same costs and data models. Table 19 shows the\nestimated costs to acquire and use software applications that interact with certified API\ntechnology. We recognize that costs health care providers incur will vary based on several\nfactors including, but not limited to, size of the health care entity, application usage, and\ncomplexity of deployment and maintenance. However, our estimates in this section assume\nhealth care providers incur the costs noted in Table 19.\n\n Hospitals and clinical practices that have participated in the CMS EHR Incentive\nProgram will be impacted. We estimate that 95,470 clinical practices222\nand 4,519\nhospitals223\nwill be impacted by our rule.\n\n221\nDullabh P, Hovey L, Heaney-Huls K, Rajendron N, Wright A, Sittig D.

The benefits of\nour API proposal are similarly multifaceted.\n\nOur API proposal will increase interoperability by ensuring that more data is available\nand shared between EHR users. The proposal will also make data more widely available to\nsoftware developers outside of those specializing in EHR development. As a result, this data will\nlead to greater innovation in the app market resulting in new technologies for health care\n224\nHealth IT Buzz Blog, Measuring Interoperability: Listening and Learning, https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-\nblog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/interoperability-electronic-health-and-medical-records/measuring-\ninteroperability-listening-learning/.\n\n\n\n\nproviders and patients alike. In the analysis, we quantify benefits in the following three areas:\nfirst, provider time saved as a result of new efficiencies in care delivery due to new technologies,\nsuch as provider facing apps. Second, the effects of interoperability on cost-savings associated\nwith reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions, emergency room (ER) visits, and adverse\ndrug events. We focused on these outcomes for two reasons: evidence in literature indicates that\nhealth information exchange impacts the chosen measures; and cost of care associated with these\nmeasures is high and the impact of health information exchange is likely to result in significant\nbenefits in the form of a cost reduction.225\nFinally, we quantify an increase in the number of\nindividuals with access to their health information through a mechanism of their choice such as\napps.\n\nThe benefit calculations are based on the following assumptions:\n Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate. Estimates of the benefits\nare based on estimates obtained from peer reviewed academic literature. ONC reviewed\nacademic articles for validity; however, models were not replicated.\n\n Hospitals and eligible professionals that have participated in the CMS EHR Incentive\nPrograms will be impacted: Estimates assume that 439,187 health care providers and/or\n4,519 hospitals would be affected by this regulatory action.\n\n(D) Benefits: Provider time saved as a result of new efficiencies in\ncare delivery due to the optional purchase of new technologies,\nsuch as provider facing apps\n225\nAnalyzing the Public Benefit Attributable to Interoperable Health Information Exchange\nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/analyzing-public-benefit-attributable-interoperable-health-information-exchange.\n\n\n\n\nImprovements in technology result in benefits for consumers and producers through\nincreased production efficiencies (Stoneman 2018).226\nThe introduction of EHRs into the health\ncare industry is an example of this. Sinsky (2016) found physicians spend 27 percent of their total\ntime on direct clinical face time with patients, and 49.2 percent of their time on EHR and desk\nwork.227\nOutside of office hours, physicians spend another one to two hours of personal time\neach night doing additional computer and other clerical work. Despite the number of hours\nproviders spend in their EHR, there is evidence that the introduction of EHRs is associated with\ntime saved. Adler-Milstein (2013) found that EHR use compared to non-EHR use resulted in a\n5.3 percent increase in work relative value units per clinician work day.228\nImproved efficiencies are not limited to the installation of an EHR. Providers also benefit\nfrom the use of emerging technologies. Amusan (2008) found that EHR and computerized\nprovider order entry (CPOE) implementation was associated with 3.69 minutes of time saved\nfive months post implementation.229\nSimilarly, Helmons (2015) found that the impact of\nsuppressing clinically irrelevant alerts and adding clinical-decision support to EHRs saved\nproviders about two percent of their time.\n\nTo measure the benefits of the API provision on providers’ time as a result of new\ntechnologies, we examined the literature on the impact of IT on productivity across various\nindustries. As explained in Bartel (2007), improvements in IT could affect productivity through\nmultiple mechanisms that are not necessarily associated with the underlying intention of that\n226\nStoneman P, Bartoloni E., Baussola M.

We adopt the same logic here. Specifically,\nwe assume that the impact of the data made available under our API provisions will not be\nthrough a single mechanism, such as an EHR, but will have multiple spillover effects. For\nexample, data made available through an API could be used by a software developer to create\ntools to improve patient scheduling and billing processes. Use of this tool could result in\nimprovements in the providers’ workflow. Thus, is important to quantify the impacts of data\nmade available through APIs on the future health IT market.\n\nTable 20 provides a summary of the results of the literature review used to quantify this\nbenefit.\n\nTable 20: Findings from literature on the impact of information technology on productivity\nStudy Description Findings:\nBartel et al (2007) Identify impact in improvements in information technology on\nproduction time of valve manufacturing.

Epub 2014 Aug 25.\n\nAs illustrated in the Table 20, the incremental effects of improvements in IT on\nproductivity range from one percent to eight percent. Based on these findings, we assume the\nimpact of the API provision on providers’ time ranges between one percent and five percent. The\nlower bound estimate of one percent assumes that, at a minimum, providers will use one new app\ncreated as a result of the data made available under the API provision. We assume that this app\nwill save providers time equivalent to the introduction of clinical decision support tools found in\nWagholikar (2015). The upper bound estimate of five percent assume that, at a maximum,\nproviders will use multiple apps created such that the combination will result in an increase in\nproductivity. Furthermore, we assume that the API provision will affect only providers with\ncertified EHRs and those that participated in the CMS EHR Incentive Program (439,187). Given\nthat an average provider spends six hours with an EHR per day,231\nearns $97.85 per hour, and\nworks 260 days per year, physicians’ time saved attributed to API technology range from $670\nmillion to $3.4 billion per year.\n\n(E) Benefits: Reduced Costs Associated with the Impact of\nInteroperability on Health Outcomes\nTo identify the impact of the API proposal on interoperability and therefore identified\nhealth outcomes, we used regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability\nmodels that identified the impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability\n231\nChristine Sinsky et al., Allocation of Physician Time in Ambulatory Practice: A Time and Motion Study in 4\nSpecialties, Ann Intern Med. (Dec. 6, 2016), at 753-60.\n\n\n\n\n(whether a hospital sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using data\nfrom the American Hospital Association (AHA)232\nfrom years 2014 to 2015 in the model, we\ncontrolled for hospital size, profit status, participation in a health information organization, and\nstate and year fixed effects. The marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition certified health IT\nequated to a five percent increase in interoperability. This is an upper bound estimate. For the\npurpose of this analysis, we assume that one to four percentage points would be a reasonable\nrange for API’s marginal impact on interoperability.\n\nAs noted previously, there might be shared benefits across certain provisions, and we have\ntaken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each provision are unique to the specific\nprovision. We assumed that the collective impact of real world testing and API proposals on\ninteroperability would not exceed the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT (estimated at\nfive percent). We distributed the five percent benefit across our real world testing and API\nproposals at (0.1-1 percent) to (1-4 percent) respectively. Moreover, the number of providers\nimpacted is specific to each provision. Thus, to finalize our calculations of the reduced costs\nrelated to reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions, emergency room (ER) visits, and\nadverse drug events due to increased interoperability, we leveraged evidence from the literature\nthat found an association between providers’ rates of interoperability and applied the estimated\nmarginal effect of each proposal on interoperability. Given data limitations, we believe this\napproach allows us to estimate the benefits of our final rule without double counting the impact\neach provision might have on interoperability.\n\nTable 21: Benefit of API on Health Care Outcomes(2017 Dollars)\n232\nAmericanHospitalAssociationHealthIT SupplementSurvey,http://www.ahadata.com/aha-healthcare-database/.\n\n\n\n\nBenefit Type Number\nAffected\nOverall\nInterop\nImpact\n(marginal\neffect)\nImpact of\nAPI\nTotal\nCost\n% of\nTotal\nCost\nImpacted\nTotal BenefitA\nMin Max Min Max\nDuplicate\ntesting\n439,187\nproviders\n0.09 B\n0.01 0.04 $200\nbillionC\n100% $185\nmillion\nper\nyear\n$742\nmillion\nper\nyear\nAvoidable\nhospitalizations\nand\nreadmissions\n4,519\nhospitals\n0.09 B\n0.01 0.04 $41\nbillionD\n100% $38\nmillion\nper\nyear\n$152\nmillion\nper\nyear\nER visits 131\nmillio\nn\nvisitsE\n0.03 B\n0.01 0.04 $1,233\nper ER\nvisit\n100% $50\nmillion\nper\nyear\n$200\nmillion\nper\nyear\nAdverse drug\nevents\n20% of\nevents\naffected\n22%F\n0.01 0.04 $30\nbillionG\n20% $14\nmillion\nper\nyear\n$54\nmillion\nper\nyear\nA\nTotal benefit is a product of total cost, percent of total cost impacted, overall impact of interoperability, and impact\nof API, adjusted for inflation (1.03)\nB\nStephen E.

APIs make it\neasier for patients to transmit data to smartphone health applications. According to the Health\nInformation National Trends Survey,233\nnearly 20 percent of Americans were offered access and\nviewed their online medical record using smartphone health applications in 2019. The proportion\nof individuals accessing their online medical records using smartphone health applications is\nexpected to grow as APIs become more widespread. This will result in cost savings to patients.\n\nSpecifically, patients who use new applications to access copies of their medical record instead\nof contacting their provider will have cost savings.\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, individuals have the right to access their Protected\nHealth Information (PHI) (45 CFR 164.524), and 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4) sets forth\nimplementation specifications for fees that covered entities may charge individuals for access to\ntheir PHI. Under 45 CFR 164.524(c)(4), a covered entity may impose a reasonable, cost-based\nfee (consistent with the conditions in § 164.524(c)(4)(i) through (iv)). For purposes of this\nanalysis, we assume covered entities can charge a flat fee not to exceed $6.50 (inclusive of all\nlabor, supplies, and any applicable postage). The API Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements finalized in § 170.404 do not allow for a “Certified API Developer”\n\n(as defined in § 170.404(c)) to charge patients for connecting to an API to access, exchange, or\nuse their EHI. A Certified API Developer is permitted to charge fees to an API Information\n233\nThese estimates were derived from Health Information National Trends Survey 5, Cycle 1 (2017).\n\n\n\n\nSource related to the use of certified API technology. The fees must be limited to the recovery of\nincremental costs reasonably incurred by the Certified API Developer when it hosts certified API\ntechnology on behalf of the API Information Source (§ 170.404). Thus, patients would ultimately\nsee cost savings by accessing their online medical record using a smartphone health application\ninstead of contacting their provider for an electronic copy.\n\nTo identify the potential cost savings this rule will have for patients, we used data from\nthe Health Information National Trends Survey to estimate the proportion of individuals who\nreported having to bring a test result to a doctor’s appointment at least once in the past year. In\n2018, approximately 81 percent of Americans reported that they saw a doctor in the past year\nand about 19 percent of these individuals reporting having to bring a test result to an\nappointment. Therefore, using Census data from December 31, 2017, we conducted the\nfollowing calculation (total U.S. population 325.9M) * (81 percent of individuals saw a doctor in\nthe past year) * (19 percent of individuals who had to bring a test result to an appointment). This\nresulted in an estimate of 50.2 million Americans who bring test results to a doctor’s\nappointment each year. We recognize that not all of these individuals will have the capability to\naccess an online medical record using a smartphone health application. Therefore, we discounted\nthis estimate based on the proportion of individuals who currently access their online medical\nrecords using a smartphone health applications (14 percent), as our lower bound. Our upper\nbound is the proportion of individuals who reported being offered access to an online medical\nrecord by a health care provider or insurer (58 percent). These calculations are in Table 22.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above calculations, we estimated the annual benefit to health care providers\nfor the use of these API capabilities would, on average, range from $6.7 million to $140 million.\n\nWe estimated the annual benefit due to improved health outcomes would, on average, range from\n$287 million to $1.1 billion. We estimated the annual benefit to patients having access to their\nonline medical record would, on average, range from $45.8 million and $189.8 million.\n\nTherefore, we estimated the total annual benefit of APIs, on average, to range from $0.34 billion\nto $1.43 billion.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specific to our approach to estimating the\nbenefits of API support.\n\n*Response.* We have maintained our overall approach for the costs and benefits associated\nwith the API provisions of this rule. As discussed in section IV.B.7 of this final rule preamble,\nwe have added a new requirement in the finalized § 170.315(g)(10) that gives patients the\ncapability to revoke access to an authorized application. Cost estimates for this new requirement\nTable 22: Benefit of API on Patients Having Access to their Health Information(2017 dollars)\nBenefit Type Number\nAffected\nProportion of\nIndividuals\nImpacted\nTotal\nCost\nSavings\nTotal Benefit\nMin Max Min Max\nCost savings to patients\nfor requesting an\nelectronic copy of their\nmedical record\n50,156,010A\npatients\n14%B\n58%B\n$6.50C\nper\npatient\n$45.8\nmillion per\nyear\n$189.8\nmillion per\nyear\nA\nThis represents the number of individuals who had to bring a medical test result to an appointment with a health\ncare provider in the past year.

The Current State of Patients’ Access and Using their Electronic Health Information.\n\nPresented at the ONC Annual Meeting on January 27, 2020.\n\n**C**\n\nWe assume that providers charge individuals a flat fee for all requests for electronic copies of PHI maintained\nelectronically, provided the fee does not exceed $6.50, inclusive of all labor, supplies, and any applicable postage.\n\n\n\n\nwere added to cost tables 16 A and 16 B as task six. The task of meeting this additional finalized\nrequirement increased the overall cost estimate for the API provisions by $9.8 million to $43\nmillion. Due to this increase in cost, we re-evaluated our benefits estimates associated with\nincreasing patients’ access to their health information. In the Proposed Rule, we qualitatively\ndiscussed benefits of patients having increased access to their health information. However, upon\nfurther consideration, and additional data sources, we were able to estimate cost savings to\npatients for requesting electronic copies of their medical record. These estimates are reflected in\nTable 22. We provided additional rationale to substantiate our approach and we updated\nestimates to 2017 dollars.\n\n(iv) New Privacy and Security Certification Criteria\nAs specified in section IV.C.3 of this final rule, we have adopted two new privacy and\nsecurity transparency attestation certification criteria in § 170.315(d)(12) and (13) that are part of\nthe 2015 Edition privacy and security certification framework. The criteria will serve to identify\nwhether certified health IT supports encrypting authentication credentials and/or multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA). They do not require new development or implementation to take place in\norder to be met. However, certification to these criteria will provide increased transparency and,\nperhaps, motivate the small percentage of health IT developers that do neither to encrypt\nauthentication credentials and/or support multi-factor authentication, which will help prevent\nexposure to unauthorized persons/entities.\n\n(A) Costs\nComments. We did not receive any comment specific to any method we could use to\nquantify the costs of the new privacy and security certification criteria, encrypt authentication\ncredentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) (§ 170.315 (d)(13)), and\n\n\n\n\nrequiring health IT developers to assess their Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or\n“no” to the certification criteria.\n\n*Response.* We have maintained our estimates of the costs of this provision in the final\nrule.\n\n(B) Benefits\nAs stated previously, we have not required health IT developers to encrypt authentication\ncredentials or support multi-factor authentication (MFA). Instead, we have required that they\nattest to whether or not they support the certification criteria. By requiring an attestation, we are\npromoting transparency, which might motivate some health IT developers that do not currently\nencrypt authentication credentials or support MFA to do so. If health IT developers are\nmotivated by these criteria and ultimately do encrypt authentication credentials and/or support\nMFA, we acknowledge that there would be costs to do so; however, we assume that the benefits\nwill substantially exceed the costs. Such encryption and adopting MFA would reduce the\nlikelihood that authentication credentials would be compromised and would eliminate an\nunnecessary use of IT resources. Encrypting authentication credentials and adopting MFA could\ndirectly reduce providers’ operating and support costs, which will reduce their administrative and\nfinancial burden. Encrypting authentication credentials will also help decrease costs and burdens\nby reducing the number of password resets due to possible phishing or other vulnerabilities.\n\nAccording to Verizon’s 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, 81 percent of hacking-\nrelated breaches leveraged either stolen and/or weak passwords.234\nThe Verizon report\nencourages customers to vary their passwords and use two-factor authentication. Also, National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity\n234\nhttps://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2017_dbir.pdf\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines, Authentication and Lifecycle Management,235\nrecommends the use of, and provides\nthe requirements for multi-factor authenticators.\n\nBased on these reports and other anecdotal evidence, we believe encrypting\nauthentication credentials and supporting MFA are established best practices among industry\ndevelopers, including health IT developers. As described above, in this final rule, we required\nhealth IT developers to attest to whether they encrypt authentication credentials. We do not have\naccess to published literature that details how health IT developers are already encrypting\nauthentication credentials and supporting MFA industry-wide, but we believe most health IT\ndevelopers, or around 80 percent, are taking such actions. We assume that building this\nfunctionality is in the future project plans for the remaining 20 percent because, as noted\npreviously, adopting these capabilities is an industry best practice. Health IT developers that\nhave not yet adopted these capabilities are likely already making financial investments to get up\nto speed with industry standards. We believe the adoption of these criteria will motivate these\nhealth IT developers to speed their implementation process, but we have not attributed a\nmonetary estimate to this potential benefit because our rule is not a direct cause of health IT\ndevelopers adopting these capabilities. We anticipate that when we release this final rule, many\nmore, or perhaps all, health IT developers will likely already be encrypting authentication\ncredentials and supporting MFA. We welcomed comments on this expectation and any means or\nmethods we could use to quantify these benefits.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comment specific to any means or methods we could\nuse to quantify the costs and benefits of having the new privacy and security transparency\nattestation certification criteria, encrypt authentication credentials (§ 170.315(d)(12)) and multi-\n235\nhttps://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html\n\n\n\n\nfactor authentication (MFA) (§ 170.315(d)(13)), and requiring health IT developers to assess\ntheir Health IT Modules’ capabilities and attest “yes” or “no” to the certification criteria.\n\n*Response.* We maintain our estimates of the costs and benefits of this provision in the\nfinal rule. We also continue to believe that the adoption of these criteria will motivate these\nhealth IT developers to speed their implementation process.\n\n(v) Security Tags – Summary of Care—Send and Security Tags – Summary\nof Care—Receive\nIn this final rule, we updated the 2015 Edition Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P)\ncertification criteria in § 170.315(b)(7) and (8) to support a more granular approach to privacy\ntagging data for health information exchange. We also renamed the criteria to reduce confusion\nand better align with the criteria, “Security tags – Summary of Care—send” and “Security tags –\nSummary of Care—receive.” The criteria will remain based on the C-CDA and the HL7 DS4P\nstandard. These criteria will include capabilities for applying the DS4P standard at the document,\nsection, and entry level. In the Proposed Rule, we proposed to adopt a third 2015 Edition DS4P\ncertification criterion, “consent management for APIs” (§ 170.315(g)(11)), that requires health\nIT to be capable of responding to requests for data through an API in accordance with the\nConsent Implementation Guide, which we did not finalize.\n\n(A) Costs\nWe anticipate these updated criteria will result in up-front costs to health IT developers as\nhealth IT would be required to support all three levels – document, section, and entry – as\nspecified in the current DS4P standard. However, we note that these criteria are not being\nrequired in any program at this time. As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of the 2019\ncalendar year, only about 30 products (products with multiple certified versions were counted\nonce) were certified to the current 2015 Edition DS4P certification criteria. We estimated that 10\n\n\n\n\nto15 products will implement the new DS4P criteria. Developers may need to perform fairly\nextensive health IT upgrades to support the more complex and granular data tagging\nrequirements under these criteria. We anticipate developers will need approximately 1500 to\n2500 hours to upgrade databases and/or other backend infrastructure to appropriately apply\nsecurity tags to data and/or develop access control capabilities. Moreover, developers will likely\nincur costs to upgrade health IT to generate a security-labeled C-CDA conforming to the DS4P\nstandard. We estimated developers will need 400 to 600 hours per criterion to make these\nupgrades on systems that had previously certified to the document-level DS4P criteria, or 720 to\n1220 hours per criterion for systems that are implementing these criteria for the first time. We\nbelieve this work would be performed by a “Software Developer.” According to the May 2017\nBLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for software developer is $53.74.\n\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100\npercent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $107. Therefore, we\nestimated the total cost to developers could range from $2,910,400 to $6,933,600. We note that\nthis would be a one-time cost. The midpoint of ranges stated is used as the primary estimate of\ncosts.\n\nAdditionally, we proposed that the health IT support the capability to respond to requests\nfor patient consent information through an API compatible with FHIR Release 3. However, we\ndid not finalize that proposal. Therefore, we did not include an estimate in this final rule.\n\nWe have estimated costs using the following assumptions:\n For the two Security tags – Summary of Care criteria, we anticipate developers will need\napproximately 1,500 to 2,500 hours to upgrade databases and/or other backend infrastructure\nto appropriately apply security tags to data and/or develop access control capabilities. We\nexpect that this would be a one-time cost.\n\n\n\n\n According to the May 2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly\nwage for a “Software Developer” is $53.74.\n\nOur cost estimates are explained in the Table 23.\n\nTable 23: Costs Related to Security Tags – Summary of Care Criteria (2017 Dollars)\nTasks Lower\nBound\nUpper\nBound\nRemarks\nTask 1:\nEnhancements to\nhealth IT to upgrade\ndatabases and/or\nother backend\ninfrastructure to\nappropriately apply\nsecurity tags to data\nand/or develop access\ncontrol capabilities\n1,500 hours 2,500 hours This is a one-time cost\nfor health IT systems to\nsupport data\nsegmentation for\ndiscrete data.\n\nTotal Labor Hours 1,500 hours 2,500 hours\nHourly Rate $107 per hour\nCost per Product $160,500 $267,500\nTotal Cost (23 products) $3,691,500 $6,152,500\nWe believe the voluntary nature of these criteria would significantly mitigate health IT\ndeveloper costs. We also expect developers to see a return on their investment in developing and\npreparing their health IT for these certification criteria given the benefits to interoperable\nexchange.\n\nWe anticipate potential costs for ONC related to the updated DS4P criteria (Security tags\n– Summary of Care—send and Security tags – Summary of Care—receive) associated with: (1)\ndeveloping and maintaining information regarding these updated criteria on the ONC website;\n(2) creating documents related to these updated criteria and making those documents 508\ncompliant; (3) updating, revising, and supporting Certification Companion Guides, test\n\n\n\n\nprocedures, and test tools; and (4) responding to inquiries concerning these criteria. We estimate\nan ONC analyst at the GS-13, Step 1 level staff would devote, on average, 200 hours to the\nabove tasks annually. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $91. Therefore, we estimate the annual costs to be $18,200.\n\n(B) Benefits\nWe believe leveraging the DS4P standard’s ability to allow for both document level and\nmore granular tagging would offer functionality that is more valuable to providers and patients,\nespecially given the complexities of the privacy landscape for multiple care and specialty\nsettings. The updated DS4P criteria (Security tags – Summary of Care—send and Security tags –\nSummary of Care—receive) would benefit providers, patients, and ONC because it would\nsupport more complete records, contribute to patient safety, and enhance care coordination. We\nbelieve this will also reduce burden for providers by enabling an automated option, rather relying\non case-by-case manual redaction and subsequent workarounds to transmit redacted documents.\n\nImplementing security tags enables providers to more effectively share patient records with\nsensitive information, thereby protecting patient privacy while still delivering actionable clinical\ncontent. We emphasize that health care providers already have processes and workflows to\naddress their existing compliance obligations, which could be made more efficient and cost\neffective through the use of health IT. We expect these benefits for providers, patients, and ONC\nto be significant; however, we are unable to quantify these benefits at this time because we do\nnot have adequate information to support quantitative estimates. We welcomed comments\nregarding potential approaches for quantifying these benefits.\n\n*Comments.* Several commenters indicated there would be cost burden associated with our\nproposal of adopting two new DS4P certification criteria and a consent management for API\ncriterion. Commenters stated that ONC needs to quantify and include the cost of this burden in\n\n\n\n\nour impact analysis section. Another commenter conducted their own analysis and indicated a\ncost of $5-6 billion with a multi-year implementation timeframe. Commenters stated there could\nbe significant upfront costs and ongoing costs for maintenance of the systems necessary to\ncomply with these criteria and one commenter further explained that segmenting data at the\ndocument, section, and entry level as opposed to the document level only, would significantly\nincrease costs and could potentially impact system performance. One commenter was\nspecifically concerned that the proposal would broadly impact HIEs both in terms of\nadministration and implementation but did not state specifics.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. We did not finalize the consent\nmanagement for API criterion. For the DS4P-related criteria (Security tags – Summary of Care—\nsend and Security tags – Summary of Care—receive), the developer costs were estimated for\nsupporting DS4P IG enhancements to include tagging the data at the section and entry level\nwhen exchanged using the C-CDA. The lower bound estimates include developers who are\nalready supporting the DS4P IG for tagging data at “document” level and estimates additional\neffort to support tagging at “section” and “entry” level. The criteria do not require the capability\nto segment the data, only to tag the data.\n\nThe certification criteria does not make any additional expectations around compliance\nbeyond what the providers are currently expected to do, nor does it add any additional\nrequirements for developers around how they handle the data received with the tags. Therefore,\nwe disagree with the commenters about underestimating the cost. Rather, the commenters may\nbe suggesting implementation costs which are beyond the costs associated with the certification\ncriteria itself. These costs are unquantifiable and are noted in Table 31.\n\n(3) Conditions and Maintenance of Certification Requirements\n(i) Information Blocking\n\n\n\n\nFor a discussion of the costs and benefits of the exceptions to information blocking,\nplease see section (5) of this RIA.\n\n(ii) Assurances\nIn this final rule, we included a provision that requires health IT developers to make\ncertain assurances as Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements: (1) assurances\nregarding the “EHI export” certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10) and (2) assurances\nregarding retaining records and information in 170.402(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\n\n(A) Electronic Health Information Export\nAlongside the criterion revisions in § 170.315(b)(10), we have finalized in §\n170.402(a)(4), that a health IT developer of a certified health IT Modules that is part of a health\nIT product which electronically stores EHI must certify to the certification criterion in §\n170.315(b)(10). We have finalized in § 170.402(b)(2) that within 36 months from the final rule’s\npublication date, a health IT developer that must comply with the requirements of paragraph §\n170.402(a)(4) of this section must provide all of its customers of certified health IT with the\nhealth IT certified to the certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). We also finalized that on and\nafter 36 months from the publication of this final rule, health IT developers that must comply\nwith the requirements of § 170.402(a)(4) must provide all of their customers of certified health\nIT with health IT certified to § 170.315(b)(10). In addition, a health IT developer must attest\naccurately in accordance with § 170.402(a)(4) and (b)(2) if the Health IT Module presented for\ncertification is part of a heath IT product which can electronically store EHI. If the product stores\nsuch information, the health IT developer must ensure all EHI is available for export in\naccordance with § 170.315(b)(10).\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the costs and benefits of the assurances regarding the\ncriterion in § 170.315(b)(10), please see section (2)(ii) (EHI export) of this RIA above.\n\n\n\n\n(B) Records and Information Retention\nAs a Maintenance of Certification requirement in § 170.402(b)(1), a health IT developer\nmust, for a period of 10 years beginning from the date of certification, retain all records and\ninformation necessary that demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance with the requirements of\nthe ONC Health IT Certification Program. In an effort to reduce administrative burden, we also\nfinalized that in situations where applicable certification criteria are removed from the Code of\nFederal Regulations before the 10 years have expired, records must only be kept for three years\nfrom the date of removal for those certification criteria and related Program provisions unless\nthat timeframe would exceed the overall 10-year retention period. This “three-year from the date\nof removal” records retention period also aligns with the records retention requirements for\nONC-ACBs and ONC-ATLs under the Program.\n\nAs stated in the Proposed Rule, currently, there are no existing regulatory requirements\nregarding record and information retention by health IT developers. We expect there are costs to\ndevelopers to retain the records and information described above but they may be mitigated due\nto other factors. For example, we expect that health IT developers are already keeping most of\ntheir records and information in an electronic format. We also expect that some developers may\nalready be retaining records and information for extended periods of time due to existing\nrequirements of other programs, including for those programs their customers participate in. For\ninstance, Medicaid managed care companies are required to keep records for 10 years from the\neffective date of a contract.\n\nWe estimated that each health IT developer will, on average, spend two hours each week\nto comply with our proposed record retention requirement. We expect that a health IT\ndeveloper’s office clerk could complete the record retention responsibilities. According to the\nMay 2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for an office clerk is\n\n\n\n\n$16.30.236\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are\nequal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $32.\n\nTherefore, we estimated the annual cost per developer on average, would be $3,328 and\nthe total annual cost for all health IT developers (458 health IT developers have products\ncertified to the 2015 Edition that are capable of recording patient health data) on average, would\nbe $1.5 million. We note that this is a perpetual cost.\n\n(iii) Prohibition or Restriction of Communications\n(A) Costs\nHealth IT developers need to notify their customers about the unenforceability of\ncommunications and contract provisions that violate the Communications Condition of\nCertification requirements in § 170.403(a). Generally, health IT developers already have\nmechanisms in place, whether via online postings, email, mail, or phone, for alerting customers\nto changes in their policies and procedures. Such alerts should be standard practice. However, we\nhave estimated the potential costs for health IT developers to draft the notice and mail the notice\nas appropriate. We estimated that a health IT developer’s office clerk will commit (overall)\napproximately 40 hours to drafting and mailing notices when necessary. According to the May\n2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for an office clerk is\n$16.30.237\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs (including benefits) are\nequal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including overhead costs is $32.\n\nTherefore, we estimated the annual cost per developer to be $1,280 and the total cost for all\nhealth IT developers (792 health IT developers certified to the 2014 Edition) to be $1 million.\n\n236\nSee https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes439061.htm\n237\nSee https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes439061.htm\n\n\n\n\nWe note that a developer must notify all customers annually until any contracts contravening the\nCondition are amended.\n\nWe also note that mailing is one option for delivery, along with other means such as\nemail. We do not have information concerning how health IT developers will deliver their\nnotices. We have estimated a total cost for all developers to mail the initial notices (including\npostage) to be $80,000. As noted above, this notice may have to be provided annually, depending\non when contracts contravening this provision are amended.\n\nIn order to meet the Cures Act requirement that health IT developers do not prohibit or\nrestrict communication regarding health IT, some health IT developers will eventually need to\namend their contracts to reflect such a change. Many standard form health IT contracts limit the\nability of users to voluntarily discuss problems or report usability and safety concerns that they\nexperience when using their health IT. This type of discussion or reporting is typically prohibited\nthrough broad confidentiality, nondisclosure, and intellectual property provisions in the\ndeveloper’s standard form health IT contract. Some standard form health IT contracts may also\ninclude non-disparagement clauses that prohibit customers from making statements that could\nreflect negatively on the health IT developer. These practices are often referred to colloquially in\nthe industry as “gag clauses.” We expect amendments to these clauses to be accomplished in the\nnormal course of business, such as when renegotiating contracts or updating them for HIPAA\nRules or other compliance requirements outside of the ONC Health IT Certification Program. As\nsuch, we do not estimate any direct or indirect costs for health IT developers to amend their\ncontracts to comply with this Condition of Certification requirement.\n\n(B) Benefits\nWe expect health care providers to benefit from this provision. There is growing\nrecognition that these practices of prohibiting or restricting communication do not promote\n\n\n\n\nhealth IT safety or good security hygiene and that health IT contracts should support and\nfacilitate the transparent exchange of information relating to patient care. We were unable to\nestimate these benefits because we do not have adequate information to determine the prevalence\nof gag clauses and other restrictive practices, nor do we have a means to quantify the value to\nproviders of being able to freely communicate and share information. We welcomed comments\non approaches to quantify these benefits.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comments specific to our approach of quantifying the\nbenefits of our provision to inform customers regarding the prohibition or restriction of\ncommunications. We did receive several comments stating that our notification and contract\nrevision estimates underestimate the volume of agreements for large developers and the cost of\ncompliance. We also received several comments that the burden for revising contracts could be\nsignificant and costly, particularly in the timeframe originally proposed, with one comment\nadding that the cost for revising contracts should be included in the impact analysis.\n\n*Response.* We maintain that we were unable to estimate the benefits of the provision due\nto inadequate information however, we believe that prohibiting or restricting communication\ndoes not promote health IT safety or good security hygiene and that health IT contracts should\nsupport and facilitate the transparent exchange of information relating to patient care. We\nmaintain our notification estimates as we believe that large developers would have efficient\nmeans of sending notifications i.e.by email. We reiterate that we expect revision of contracts to\nbe accomplished in the normal course of business and do not estimate any direct or indirect costs\nfor health IT developers to amend their contracts to comply.\n\n(iv) Application Programming Interfaces\nFor a discussion of the costs and benefits of the new API criterion in § 170.315(g)(10),\nplease see section (2)(iii) of this RIA.\n\n\n\n\n(A) Transparency Requirements for Application Programming\nInterfaces\nIn this final rule, as part of the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements\nin § 170.404, we have required that API Technology Suppliers make specific business and\ntechnical documentation necessary to interact with the APIs in production freely and publicly\naccessible. We expect that the API Technology Suppliers will perform the following tasks\nrelated to transparency of business and technical documentation and would devote the following\nnumber of hours annually to such tasks: (1) Health Level 7’s (HL7®) Fast Healthcare\nInteroperability Resources (FHIR®\n) API documentation (the developer would most likely point\nto the HL7 FHIR standard for API documentation) (estimated eight hours); (2) patient\napplication registration documentation, which will include a development effort to create a\nwebsite that manages the application registration activity (estimated 40 hours); (3) publication of\nthe FHIR Endpoint – Base URLs for all centrally managed providers (estimated 40 hours); (4)\npublication of FHIR Endpoints for provider-managed APIs (estimated 160 hours); and (5) API\ncost information documentation, which will typically be documented as a tiered rate based on\nusage or some form of monthly rate (estimated 40 hours).\n\nWe believe each of the above tasks would be performed by a “Software Developer.”\n\nAccording to the May 2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for\nsoftware developer is $53.74.238\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead costs\n(including benefits) are equal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including\noverhead costs is $107. Therefore, we estimated the cost per developer to be $30,816. As noted\nin section (2)(iii) of this RIA, we estimated that 459 products from 394 developers will contain\n238\nSee https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes439061.htm\n\n\n\n\nthe API criterion. Therefore, we estimated the total developer cost would be $12.1 million. We\nnote that this is a one-time cost and would not be perpetual. We did not receive comments on this\ndiscussion and have therefore finalized our figures.\n\n(v) Real World Testing\nThe objective of real world testing in § 170.405 is to verify the extent to which deployed\nhealth IT products in operational production settings are demonstrating compliance to\ncertification criteria and functioning with the intended use cases for continued maintenance of\ncertification requirements. Real world testing should ensure certified health IT products have the\nability to share electronic health information between systems. Real world testing should assess\nthat the certified health IT is meeting the intended use case(s) of the certification criteria to\nwhich it is certified within the workflow, health IT architecture, and care/practice setting in\nwhich the health IT is implemented. We note that we expect real world testing would take about\nthree months of the year to perform.\n\n(A) Costs\nThis section describes the potential costs of the real world testing requirements in this\nfinal rule. The costs estimates are based on the following assumptions:\n Health IT developers will use the same labor costs. Table 24 shows the estimated labor\ncosts for a health IT developer to perform real world testing. We recognize that health IT\ndeveloper costs will vary; however, our estimates in this section assume all developers will\nincur the costs noted in Table 24.\n\n Proxy needed to project the number of 2015 Edition products impacted by real world\ntesting. We estimated that 523 products from 429 developers will be impacted by real world\ntesting. We used a proxy to determine developers that would be subject to real world testing.\n\nThere were 681 products and 551 developers with at least one of its 2014 Edition certified\n\n\n\n\nproducts that could perform transitions of care and/or send any type of public health data. We\nthen multiplied these numbers by our estimates for certified health IT market consolidation\nby -22.1 percent and -23.2 percent to project the number of 2015 developers and products,\nrespectively. We believe this estimate serves as a reasonable proxy for products impacted by\nreal world testing, as these products primarily focus on interoperability.\n\nThe tables below describe the various costs to health IT developers to perform real world\ntesting by task.\n\nTable 24: Estimated Cost to Health IT Developers to Perform Real World Testing (2017 Dollars)\nTasks and Labor Category Hours Rate Total\nTask 1: Design Real world Testing Approach and Submit Plan (per developer) $34,560\n15-1133 Software Developers, Systems Software 80 107 $8,560\n15-1143 Computer Network Architects 120 104 $12,480\n15-1121 Computer Systems Analysts 80 89 $7,120\n15-1199 Computer Occupations, All Other 40 88 $3,520\n27-3042 Technical Writers 40 72 $2,880\nTask 2: Prepare Staff and Environments (per developer) $14,920\n15-1121 Computer Systems Analysts 40 89 $3,560\n15-1142 Network and Computer Systems Administrators 40 83 $3,320\n15-1152 Computer Network Support Specialists 40 65 $2,600\n15-1199 Computer Occupations, All Other 40 88 $3,520\n15-1122 Information Security Analysts 20 96 $1,920\nTask 3: Perform Testing (per product) $32,240\n15-1121 Computer Systems Analysts 80 89 $7,120\n15-1133 Software Developers, Systems Software 40 107 $4,280\n15-1199 Computer Occupations, All Other 160 88 $14,080\n15-1142 Network and Computer Systems Administrators 40 83 $3,320\n15-1141 Database Administrators 40 86 $3,440\nTask 4: Collect Results and Prepare-Submit Report (per developer) $20,560\n15-1199 Computer Occupations, All Other 120 88 $10,560\n15-1121 Computer Systems Analysts 80 89 $7,120\n27-3042 Technical Writers 40 72 $2,880\nTotal Labor Hours 1140 - -\nOther Direct Costs - printing, publishing (per product) $150.00\nTable 25: Real World Testing Total Annual Cost(2017 Dollars)\n\n\n\n\nTask Calculation Total Cost\nTask 1 $34,560 * 429 developers $14,826,240\nTask 2 $14,920 * 429 developers $6,400,680\nTask 3 $32,240 * 523 products $16,861,520\nTask 4 $20,560 * 429 developers $8,820,240\nOther Direct Costs $150 * 523 products $78,450\nTotal Cost $46,987,130\nBased on the stated assumptions and costs outlined in the above tables, we estimated the\ntotal annual cost for real world testing would, on average, be $47 million with an average cost\nper developer of $109,557.\n\n(B) Benefits\nThere are several benefits that can be attributed to real world testing. Real world testing\nmay impact the effective integration of varied health IT systems, including integration of\ncertified health IT with non-certified and ancillary technologies such as picture archiving and\ncommunications systems (PACS) or specialty-specific interfaces. This could result in greater\ninteroperability among health IT systems. For providers that are currently dissatisfied with how\ntheir health IT is performing, real world testing might also influence the effective\nimplementation of workflows in a clinical setting. In this analysis, we calculated the benefits in\nthe following categories: for providers that have complained about their EHR system, time saved\ndocumenting in their EHR due to improved usability; for providers that are dissatisfied with their\nEHR, increased provider satisfaction resulting in fewer providers incurring the costs of switching\nproducts; and benefits related to reductions in duplicate lab tests, readmissions, ER visits, and\nadverse drug events due to increased interoperability. We focused on these outcomes for two\nreasons: (i) evidence in literature indicates that health information exchange impacts the chosen\nmeasures; and (ii) cost of care associated with these measures is high and the impact of health\ninformation exchange is likely to result in significant benefits in the form of reduced costs.\n\nThe benefit calculations were based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n Benefits noted in academic literature are assumed accurate and results were not\nexternally validated.\n\n Hospitals and eligible professionals that participate in the CMS Promoting\nInteroperability Programs will be impacted. Estimates were based on the assumption that\n439,187 health care providers and/or 4,519 hospitals will be affected by this regulatory\naction.\n\n Estimates of the impact of real world testing on rates of interoperability (0.1 to 1\npercent) are based on ONC analysis. To identify the impact of real world testing on\ninteroperability, we used regression analysis. Specifically, we estimated linear probability\nmodels that identified impact of 2014 Edition certified EHR on hospitals’ interoperability\n(whether a hospital sends, receives, finds, and integrates summary of care records). Using\ndata from the AHA from years 2014 and 2015 in the model, we controlled for hospital size,\nprofit status, participation in a health information organization, and state and year fixed\neffects. The marginal effect of using a 2014 Edition was a five percentage point increase in\ninteroperability. This is an upper bound estimate. For the purpose of this analysis, we assume\n0.1 percent to 1 percent would be a reasonable range for real world testing to impact\ninteroperability.\n\n Impact of real world testing is also based on the estimated number of providers that\nswitch health IT developers (rate = five percent) and are dissatisfied with their current\nEHR (44 percent). To calculate the number of providers that are likely to switch their EHR\ndue to dissatisfaction with their system, we estimate the rate of switching using CMS\nMedicare EHR Incentive Program data from years 2013 to 2016. This results in 4,774\nclinical practices and 226 hospitals that are projected to switch products in a year. We then\n\n\n\n\nleverage results from Stanford Medicine’s research conducted by The Harris Poll which\nreports that nearly 44 percent of providers are not satisfied with their EHR.239\nBased on this\nresearch, we assume that approximately 2,195 providers are less likely to switch their EHR\nwith real world testing.\n\n Estimates of the rate of eligible professionals (10 percent) and hospitals (five percent)\nthat will be impacted by real world testing are based on ONC complaint data. We\nrecognize that the benefits of real world testing are limited to those providers that have\nsystems that might be underperforming. Therefore, we estimated that the providers impacted\nby this rule are limited to the proportion of providers that have issued complaints about their\nsystem to ONC.\n\nAs noted previously in this analysis, we acknowledge that there might be shared benefits\nacross certain provisions and have taken steps to ensure that the benefits attributed to each\nprovision are unique to the provision referenced. Specifically, we used regression analysis to\ncalculate the impact of our real world testing and API provisions on interoperability. We\nassumed that the real world testing and API provisions would collectively have the same impact\non interoperability as use of 2014 Edition certified health IT. Therefore, we estimated linear\nprobability models that identified the impact of 2014 Edition certified health IT on hospitals’\ninteroperability.240\nWe controlled for additional factors such as participation in a health\ninformation exchange organization, hospital characteristics, and urban/rural status. We found the\nmarginal effect of using 2014 Edition certified health IT was a five percentage point increase in\ninteroperability.\n\n239\nHow Doctors Feel About Electronic Health Records National Physician Poll by The Harris Poll\nhttp://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/ehr/documents/EHR-Poll-Presentation.pdf\n240\nAmerican Hospital Association Health IT Supplement Survey, http://www.ahadata.com/aha-healthcare-database/.\n\n\n\n\nWe assumed that this marginal effect is true for our provisions and distributed the five\npercent benefit across our real world testing and API provisions at (0.1 to1 percent) to (1 to 4\npercent) respectively. Moreover, the number of providers impacted is provision specific. Given\ndata limitations, we believe this approach allows us to estimate the benefits of our provisions\nwithout double counting the impact each provision might have on interoperability.\n\nTable 26 shows the benefits of real world testing for providers. We quantified the monetary\nbenefits of real world testing based on a reduction in the amount of time a provider spends on\ntheir EHR by improving its usability or the cost-savings associated with switching from an\nunderperforming EHR system. Note, these benefits are limited to providers who have expressed\ndissatisfaction with their EHR and only represent a fraction of all health care providers. Table 27\nquantifies the benefits associated with improved interoperability for these providers. This is\nprimarily because provider behavior is more directly affected by improvements in\ninteroperability.\n\nTable 26: Benefit of Real World Testing for Providers(2017 Dollars)\nBenefit Type Number\nAffected\nHourly\nWage\nHours saved\n(percent)A,B\nHours\nPer\nDay\nWith\nEHR\nNumber\nof\nworking\ndays in a\nyear\nTotal Benefit C\nMin Max Min Max\nReduction in\nprovider time\nspent in health\nIT by\nimproving\nusability and\ninteroperability\n43,919\nproviders or\n10%D\n(based\non complaint\ndata)\n97.85 1 5 6E\n260 $65\nmillion\nper year\n$335\nmillion\nper\nyear\n\n\n\n\nNumber of\nproviders\nswitching\nhealth ITF\n2,195;\nCost of\nSwitching\nMin=$15,000\nMax=$70,000\n$34M\nper year\n$158M\nper\nyear\nTotal Benefit $99M\nper year\n$493M\nper\nyear\nA\nJulia Adler-Milstein and Robert S.

Based on the stated assumptions and benefits outlined in Table 27, we estimate the\ntotal annual benefit for patients and payers would range, on average, from $2.6 million to $26.3\n\n\n\n\nmillion. Therefore, we estimate the total benefit of real world testing would range, on average,\nfrom $101.6 million to $519.3 million.\n\nWe recognize that health IT developers may deploy their systems in a number of ways,\nincluding cloud-based deployments, and requested comment on whether our cost estimates of\nreal world testing should factor in such methods of system deployment. For example, we\nrequested feedback about whether health IT developers would incur reduced real world testing\ncosts through cloud-based deployments as opposed to other deployment methods. We\nspecifically solicited comment on the general ratio of cloud-based to non-cloud-based\ndeployments within the health care ecosystem and specific cost variations in performing real\nworld testing based on the type of deployment. We also requested comment on our assumptions\nabout the burden to providers in time spent assisting health IT developers since we encourage\nhealth IT developers to come up with ways to perform real world testing that mitigate provider\ndisruption.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comment specific to whether health IT developers would\nincur reduced real world testing costs through cloud-based deployments as opposed to other\ndeployment methods. We also did not receive comments regarding the ratio of cloud-based to\nnon-cloud based deployments and cost variations regarding different types of deployments. We\nalso did not receive comments regarding the burden to providers in time spent assisting health IT\ndevelopers.\n\n*Response.* We maintain our assumptions and estimates as proposed regarding real world\ntesting.\n\n(C) Real World Testing Maintenance Requirements\nIn this final rule, we revised the Principle of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(m) to require\nONC-ACBs to collect, no less than quarterly, all updates successfully made to standards in\n\n\n\n\ncertified health IT pursuant to the developers having opted to avail themselves of the Standards\nVersion Advancement Process flexibility under the real world testing Condition of Certification\nrequirement. Under § 170.523(p), ONC-ACBs will be responsible for: (1) reviewing and\nconfirming that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing plans in accordance\nwith § 170.405(b)(1); (2) reviewing and confirming that applicable health IT developers submit\nreal world testing results in accordance with § 170.405(b)(2); and (3) submitting real world\ntesting plans by December 15 and results by March 15 of each calendar year to ONC for public\navailability. In addition, under § 170.523(t), ONC-ACBs will be required to: (1) maintain a\nrecord of the date of issuance and the content of developers’ notices; and (2) timely post content\nof each notice on the CHPL.\n\nUsing the information from the “Real World Testing Costs” section of this RIA, we\nestimated that 429 developers will be impacted by real world testing. We estimate that, on\naverage, it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30\nminutes to collect all updates made to standards in Health IT Modules in accordance with §\n170.523(m). The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $91. Since the collection must occur no less than quarterly, we\nassume it occurs, on average, four times per year. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to\nONC-ACBs to comply with the collection requirements under § 170.523(m) to be $78,078.\n\nWe estimated that, on average, it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1\nlevel approximately one hour to review and confirm that applicable health IT developers submit\nreal world testing plans in accordance with § 170.405(b)(1). We estimate that, on average, it will\ntake an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to review and\nconfirm that applicable health IT developers submit real world testing results in accordance with\n§ 170.405(b)(2). We estimate that, on average, it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13,\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 level approximately 30 minutes to submit real world testing plans and results to ONC for\npublic availability. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $91. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs to\ncomply with the submission and reporting requirements under §§ 170.523(m) and 170.550(l) to\nbe $156,156.\n\nThroughout the RIA we have used 830 products as our 2015 Edition projection. We came\nup with this projection by multiplying a -23.2 percent market consolidation rate from the total\nnumber of products certified to 2014 Edition. This assumption was based on the market\nconsolidation rate observed between the 2011 and 2014 Editions. We have estimated the number\nof 2015 Edition products that will certify each criterion included in the real world testing\nCondition of Certification requirement. We assume that there will be a cost associated with a\nnotice for each certified criterion (even if an individual product were to update the same standard\nacross multiple criteria that use that standard). This estimation was calculated by multiplying the\ncurrent percent of 2015 Edition products that certify a criterion by the estimated number of total\n2015 Edition products (830). For example, we calculated that 43 percent of 2015 Edition\nproducts certified 170.315(b)(1); we then multiplied this percentage by 830 – the predicted\nnumber of 2015 Edition products. Thus, based on this calculation, for 2015 Edition, we predict\nthat 359 products will certify the 170.315(b)(1) criterion. This method was used across all\ncriteria included in the real world testing Condition of Certification requirement.\n\nWe assume that the amount of time for an ONC-ACB staff person to: (1) maintain a\nrecord of the date of issuance and the content of developers’ notices; and (2) to timely post\ncontent of each notice on the CHPL can be anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour.\n\nThe hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC\nis approximately $91. This was the hourly rate we used for this RIA, so it is consistent with prior\n\n\n\n\ncalculations. This wage is used to determine the ONC-ACB time cost to complete this\nrequirement under § 170.523(t). For this estimate, we take half the hourly rate and multiply it by\nthe number of products predicted to certify each of the applicable criteria. For each criterion, we\nestimate a lower bound and upper bound prediction. The lower bound assumes that 25 percent of\ncertified products update any of the applicable standards. The upper bound prediction assumes\nthat all certified products update any of the applicable standards. These estimates are calculated\nfor each criterion and then the cumulative sum of all the individual criterion calculations is made.\n\nWe estimate, at 30 minutes per notice, it will cost $60,606 if 25 percent of certified products\nupdate any of the applicable standards across all criteria, and if all products update any of the\napplicable standards, we estimate it will cost $242,424. Our maximum estimate for time to\ncomply is one hour per notice.\n\nUsing the same methodology explained above, we estimate, at 60 minutes per notice, it\nwill cost $121,212 if 25 percent of certified products update any of the applicable standards\nacross all criteria, and if all products update any of the applicable standards, we estimate it will\ncost $484,848. Our lower bound estimate for the cost of this requirement is $60,606. Our upper\nbound estimate for the cost of this requirement is $484,848.\n\n*Comments.* We received a comment recommending that ONC add accountability to the real\nworld testing process by having ONC-ACBs review a randomly selected percentage of submitted\nresults for potential non-conformity with certification requirements.\n\n*Response.* We thank commenters for their input. It is within ONC-ACBs’ rights and\ninterests to randomly select certified Health IT Modules that have been real world tested as part\nof their surveillance activities. ONC will be working closely with ONC-ACBs to provide\ndirection on how ONC-ACBs can leverage existing Program and ISO/IEC 17065 requirements to\nprovide oversight without increasing burden by setting a minimum expectation in regulation.\n\n\n\n\nSetting a regulatory quota could potentially create burden as workloads amongst the different\nONC-ACBs vary. Additionally, it limits ONC-ACBs to what is adopted in the final rule and\nprevents future adjustments that may be needed to improve efficiency without additional\nrulemaking. We have finalized our estimates.\n\n(vi) Attestations\nThe Cures Act requires that a health IT developer, as a Condition and Maintenance of\nCertification requirement under the Program, provide to the Secretary an attestation to all the\nConditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements specified in the Cures Act, except for\nthe “EHR Reporting Program” Condition of Certification requirement. It also requires that a\nhealth IT developer attest that its health IT allows for health information to be exchanged,\naccessed, and used in the manner described by the API Condition of Certification requirement.\n\nWe have finalized our proposal to implement the Cures Act “attestations” requirement in §\n170.406 by requiring health IT developers to attest to the aforementioned Conditions. For the\npurposes of estimating the potential burden of these attestations on health IT developers, ONC-\nACBs, and ONC, we estimate that all health IT developers under the Program will submit an\nattestation biannually. As noted previously in this RIA, there are 792 health IT developers\ncertified to the 2014 Edition.\n\nWe estimated it would take a health IT developer employee approximately one hour on\naverage to prepare and submit each attestation to the ONC-ACB. According to the May 2017\nBLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a software developer is\n$53.74.241\nTherefore, we estimated the annual cost including overhead costs to be $84,744. We\nhave finalized that attestations will be submitted to ONC-ACBs on behalf of ONC and the\n241\nSee https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes439061.\n\n\n\n\nSecretary. We assume there will be four ONC-ACBs as this is the current number of ONC-\nACBs, and we also assume an equal distribution in responsibilities among ONC-ACBs. ONC-\nACBs would have two responsibilities related to attestations. One responsibility we finalized in §\n170.523(q) is that an ONC-ACB must review attestations for completion and submit the health\nIT developers’ attestations to ONC. We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-\n13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes on average to review and submit each attestation to\nONC. The other responsibility we are finalizing in § 170.550(l) is that an ONC-ACB would need\nto ensure that the health IT developer of the Health IT Module has met its responsibilities related\nto the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements as solely evidenced by its\nattestation. We estimate it will take an ONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level\napproximately one hour on average to complete this task. The hourly wage with benefits for a\nGS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $91. Therefore, we\nestimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs to be $108,108.\n\nWe have finalized that we would make the attestations publicly available on the CHPL\nonce they are submitted by the ONC-ACBs. ONC posts information regularly to the CHPL and\nwe estimate the added costs to post the attestation will be de minimis.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive comment specific to the methods related to the estimates\nfor posting attestations.\n\n*Response.* We maintain our assumptions and estimates as proposed regarding attestations.\n\n(4) Oversight for the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification Requirements\nOur processes for overseeing the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification\nrequirements will, for the most part, mirror our processes for direct review of non-conformities\nin certified health IT as described in current § 170.580. We may directly review a health IT\ndeveloper’s actions to determine whether they conform to the Conditions and Maintenance of\n\n\n\n\nCertification requirements finalized in this final rule. The estimated costs and benefits for such\noversight and review are detailed below.\n\n(i) Costs\nWe estimated the potential monetary costs of allowing ONC to directly review a health\nIT developer’s actions to determine whether the actions conform to the requirements of the\nProgram as follows: (1) costs for health IT developers to correct non-conforming actions\nidentified by ONC; (2) costs for health IT developers and ONC costs related to ONC review and\ninquiry into non-conforming actions by the health IT developer; and (3) costs for ONC-ACBs\nrelated to the new reporting requirement in the Principles of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(s).\n\n(A) Costs for Health IT Developers to Correct Non-Conforming\nActions Identified by ONC\nWe do not believe health IT developers face additional direct costs for the ONC direct\nreview of health IT developer actions (see cost estimates for the Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements). However, we acknowledge that this final rule may eventually\nrequire health IT developers to correct certain actions or non-conformities with their health IT\nthat do not conform to the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements.\n\nIf we identify a non-conforming action by a health IT developer, the costs incurred by the\nhealth IT developer to bring its actions into conformance will be determined on a case-by-case\nbasis. Factors that will be considered include, but are not limited to: (1) the extent of customers\nand/or business affected; (2) how pervasive the action(s) is across the health IT developer’s\nbusiness; (3) the period of time that the health IT developer was taking the action(s) in question;\nand (4) the corrective action required to resolve the issue. We are unable to reliably estimate\nthese costs as we do not have cost estimates for a comparable situation. We requested comment\non existing relevant data and methods we could use to estimate these costs.\n\n\n\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to the relevant data and methods\nused to estimate the costs to correct non-conforming actions identified by ONC.\n\n*Response.* We maintain our approach used to estimate the costs to correcting identified\nnon-conformities.\n\n(B) Costs for Health IT Developers and ONC Costs Related to ONC\nReview and Inquiry into Health IT Developer Actions\nIn order to calculate the potential costs to health IT developers and ONC related to ONC\nreview and inquiry into health IT developer actions, we have created the following categories for\npotential costs: (1) ONC review and inquiry prior to the issuance of a notice of non-conformity;\n(2) ONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health\nIT developer does not contest ONC’s findings (i.e., no appeal); and (3) ONC review and inquiry\nfollowing the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health IT developer contests ONC’s\nfindings (i.e., appeal).\n\n(C) ONC Review and Inquiry Prior to the Issuance of a Notice of\nNonconformity\nWe anticipate that ONC will receive, on average, between 100 and 200 complaints per\nyear concerning the Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements that will warrant\nreview and inquiry by ONC. We estimate that such initial review and inquiry by ONC will\nrequire, on average, two to three analysts at the GS-13 level working one to two hours each per\ncomplaint. The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington,\nDC is approximately $91. Therefore, we estimate each review and inquiry will cost ONC, on\naverage, between $182 and $546. We estimate the total annual cost to ONC will, on average,\nrange from $18,200 and $109,200. This range takes into account both the low end of reviews that\nare resolved quickly and the high end in which staff will need to discuss issues with ONC\n\n\n\n\nleadership or in some cases, HHS senior leadership including the Office of General Counsel. We\nhave not estimated health IT developer costs associated with ONC review prior to the issuance of\na notice of non-conformity because, in most cases, health IT developers are not required to take\naction prior to the notice of non-conformity.\n\n(D) ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of\nNon-conformity and the Health IT Developer Does Not Contest\nONC’s Findings\nThis category captures cases that require review and inquiry following ONC’s issuance of\na notice of non-conformity, but that do not proceed to the appeals process. Examples of such\nsituations would include, but not be limited to: (1) a health IT developer violates a Condition of\nCertification requirement and does not contest ONC’s finding that it is in violation of the\nCondition of Certification requirement; or (2) a health IT developer fails to meet a deadline, such\nas for its corrective action plan (CAP). We estimate that ONC will, on average, conduct between\n12 and 18 of these reviews annually.\n\nWe estimate that a health IT developer may commit, on average and depending on\ncomplexity, between 10 and 40 hours of staff time per case to provide ONC with all requested\nrecords and documentation that ONC would use to review and conduct an inquiry into health IT\ndeveloper actions, and, when necessary, make a certification ban and/or termination\ndetermination. We assumed that the work will be performed by a “Computer Systems Analyst.”\n\nAccording to the May 2017 BLS occupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for\ncomputer systems analyst is $44.59.242\nAs noted previously, we have assumed that overhead\ncosts (including benefits) are equal to 100 percent of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage including\n242\nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/May/oes151121.htm\n\n\n\n\noverhead costs would be $89. Therefore, we estimate the average annual cost for health IT\ndevelopers would range from $10,680 to $64,080. We note that some health IT developers’ costs\nare expected to be less and some health IT developers’ costs are expected to be more than this\nestimated cost range. Further, we note that these costs would be perpetual.\n\nWe estimate that ONC may commit, on average and depending on complexity, between\neight and 80 hours of staff time to complete a review and inquiry into health IT developer\nactions. We assume that the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 Federal employee(s) will be necessary.\n\nThe hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is\napproximately $126. Therefore, based on the estimate of between 12 and 18 cases each year, we\nestimate ONC’s annual costs would range, on average, from $12,096 to $181,440. We note that\nsome reviews and inquiries may cost less and some may cost more than this estimated cost\nrange. Further, we note that these costs would be perpetual.\n\nWe welcomed comments on our estimated costs and any comparable processes and costs\nthat we could use to improve our estimates.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to the relevant data and methods\nused to estimate the costs to: (1) ONC review and inquiry prior to the issuance of a notice of\nnon-conformity; (2) ONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-\nconformity and the health IT developer does not contest ONC’s findings (i.e., no appeal); and (3)\nONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health IT\ndeveloper contests ONC’s findings (i.e., appeal).\n\n*Response.* We maintain our approach used to estimate the costs to health IT developers\nand to ONC, related to ONC review and inquiry into health IT developer actions.\n\n\n\n\n(E) ONC Review and Inquiry Following the Issuance of a Notice of\nNon-Conformity and the Health IT Developer Contests ONC’s\nFindings\nAs discussed in section VII.C of this preamble, we permit a health IT developer to appeal\nan ONC determination to issue a certification ban and/or terminate a certification under §\n170.580(a)(2)(iii). This category of cost calculations captures cases that require review and\ninquiry following ONC’s issuance of a notice of non-conformity and where the health IT\ndeveloper contests ONC’s finding and files an appeal. We estimate that ONC will, on average,\nconduct between three and five of these reviews annually.\n\nWe estimated that a “Computer Systems Analyst” for the health IT developer may\ncommit, on average and depending on complexity, between 20 and 80 hours to provide the\nrequired information to appeal a certification ban and/or termination under § 170.580(a)(2)(iii)\nand respond to any requests from the hearing officer. According to the May 2017 BLS\noccupational employment statistics, the mean hourly wage for a computer systems analyst is\n$44.59.243\nAssuming that overhead costs (including benefits) are equal to 100 percent of pre-tax\nwages, the hourly wage including overhead costs is $89. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost,\nincluding overhead costs, for a health IT developer to appeal a certification ban and/or\ntermination under § 170.580(a)(2)(iii) would, on average, range from $5,340 to $35,600. We\nnote that some health IT developers’ costs are expected to be less and some health IT developers’\ncosts are expected to be more than this estimated cost range. Further, we note that these costs\nwould be perpetual.\n\n243\nSee https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/May/oes151121.htm\n\n\n\n\nWe estimated that ONC would commit, on average and depending on complexity,\nbetween 40 and 160 hours of staff time to conduct each appeal. This will include the time to\nrepresent ONC in the appeal and support the costs for the hearing officer. We assume that the\nexpertise of a GS-15, Step 1 Federal employee(s) would be necessary. The hourly wage with\nbenefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is approximately $126.\n\nTherefore, based on the estimate of between three and five cases each year, we estimate the cost\nfor ONC to conduct an appeal would range, on average, from $15,120 to $100,800. We note that\nsome appeals may cost less and some may cost more than this estimated cost range. Further, we\nnote that these costs would be perpetual.\n\nBased on the above estimates, we estimated the total annual costs for health IT\ndevelopers related to ONC review and inquiry into health IT developer actions would range, on\naverage, from $16,020 to $99,680. We estimated the total annual costs for ONC related to ONC\nreview and inquiry into health IT developer actions would range, on average, from $44,603 to\n$383,345.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments specific to the relevant data and methods\nused to estimate the costs of (1) ONC review and inquiry prior to the issuance of a notice of non-\nconformity; (2) ONC review and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity\nand the health IT developer does not contest ONC’s findings (i.e., no appeal); and (3) ONC\nreview and inquiry following the issuance of a notice of non-conformity and the health IT\ndeveloper contests ONC’s findings (i.e., appeal).\n\n*Response.* We maintain our approach used to estimate the costs to health IT developers\nand to ONC, related to ONC review and inquiry into health IT developer actions.\n\n(F) Costs for ONC-ACBs\n\n\n\n\nWe also note that ONC-ACBs could realize costs associated with the new reporting\nrequirement in the Principles of Proper Conduct in § 170.523(s) that they report, at a minimum,\nno later than a week after becoming aware of, any information that could inform whether ONC\nshould exercise direct review under § 170.580(a). We estimate that, on average, it will take an\nONC-ACB employee at the GS-13, Step 1 level approximately 30 minutes to prepare the report.\n\nThe hourly wage with benefits for a GS-13, Step 1 employee located in Washington, DC is\napproximately $91. Since the collection must occur no less than weekly, we will assume it\noccurs, on average, 52 times per year. Therefore, given that there are currently three ONC-\nACBs, we estimate the annual cost to ONC-ACBs to comply with the reporting requirement\nunder § 170.523(s) would, on average, be $7,098. We did not receive comments regarding our\ncalculations. We have finalized these estimates.\n\n(ii) Benefits\nThis final rule’s provisions for ONC direct review of the Conditions and Maintenance of\nCertification requirements would promote health IT developers’ accountability for their actions\nand ensure that health IT developers’ actions conform with the requirements of the Cures Act\nand Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in §§ 170.400-406. Specifically,\nONC’s direct review of health IT developer actions will facilitate ONC’s ability to require\ncomprehensive corrective action by health IT developers to address non-conforming actions\ndetermined by ONC. If ONC ultimately implements a certification ban and/or terminates a\ncertification(s), such action will serve to protect the integrity of the Program and users of health\nIT. While we do not have available means to quantify the benefits of ONC direct review of\nhealth IT developer actions, we note that ONC direct review supports and enables the National\nCoordinator to fulfill his responsibilities under the HITECH Act and Cures Act, instills public\n\n\n\n\nconfidence in the Program, and protects public health and safety. We did not receive comments\nregarding our calculations. We have finalized these estimates.(5) Information Blocking\n(i) Costs\nWe expect ONC to incur an annual cost for issuing educational resources related to the\ninformation blocking “reasonable and necessary” exceptions. We estimate that ONC issues\neducational resources each quarter, therefore, four per year. We assume that the educational\nresources would be provided by ONC staff with the expertise of a GS-15, Step 1 Federal\nemployee(s). The hourly wage with benefits for a GS-15, Step 1 employee located in\nWashington, DC is approximately $126. We estimate it would take ONC staff between 200 and\n400 hours to develop the guidance. Therefore, we estimate the annual cost to ONC would range,\non average, from $100,800 to $201,600.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments regarding the specific costs associated with\ninformation blocking.\n\n*Response.* We have adopted our estimates as proposed. We note that we did receive\ncomments regarding “burden” on various stakeholder groups related to our information blocking\nproposals, and those comments are addressed throughout the information blocking section\n(section VIII) of this final rule.\n\n(ii) Benefits\nInformation blocking not only interferes with effective health information exchange, but\nalso negatively impacts many important aspects of health and health care. For a detailed\ndiscussion of the negative impacts of information blocking, we refer readers to section\nXIV.C.2.a(2) of the Proposed Rule (84 FR 7584).\n\nThe exceptions to the information blocking definition adopted in this final rule create\nclear guidelines for industry regarding pro-competitive and other beneficial activities and will\n\n\n\n\nenable stakeholders to determine more easily and with greater certainty whether their activities\nare excepted from the information blocking definition. Overall, the finalized exceptions are\naccommodating to legitimate industry practices for health IT developers, hospitals, and health\ncare providers and, we believe, will ease the burden and compliance costs for these parties.\n\nTo estimate the benefits of information blocking, we first examined existing data sources\nto identify a proxy that will indicate the extent to which information blocking is occurring.\n\nAccording to analysis of data from the American Hospital Association IT Supplement survey, 53\npercent of non-Federal acute care hospitals reported that they had challenges with exchanging\ndata across different vendor platforms.244\nMoreover, 31 percent reported that they must pay\nadditional costs to exchange information with organizations outside of the system. Nearly one in\nfour hospitals reported that they had to develop customized interfaces to electronically exchange\ninformation.\n\nTo quantify the magnitude of information blocking and the benefits of restricting\ninformation blocking, we estimated the following, which gives us the imposed cost of\ninformation blocking for each health outcome: [percent of providers that engage in cross-vendor\nexchange] * [marginal effect (ME) of information blocking on interoperability] * [ME effect of\ninteroperability on the health outcome] * [total cost of health outcome].\n\nWe extracted the “ME effect of interoperability on the health outcome” and “cost of\nhealth outcomes” from academic literature (see citations in Table 24). We then determined a\nproxy for the number of providers that engage in cross-vendor exchange. We did this by\nleveraging hospital referral data from 2015 to determine the proportion of hospitals that referred\n244\nPylypchuk Y., Johnson C., Henry J. & Ciricean D. (November 2018).

Office of the National Coordinator for Health\nInformation Technology: Washington DC.\n\n\n\n\npatients to a provider outside of their system where the receiving provider used a different EHR\nvendor. We determined that 82 percent of hospitals engaged in cross-vendor exchange. This\nestimate was used as the proxy for “providers that engaged in cross-vendor exchange.”\n\nWe estimated the “ME of information blocking on interoperability” through the\nfollowing research design:\nY=b1InforBlock+X’B+e\nWhere y=1 if a hospital routinely engages in four domains of interoperability – sending,\nreceiving, finding, and integrating data, 0 otherwise. The variable InforBlock is a binary\nindicator for whether a hospital reported experiencing challenges with exchanging data across\ndifferent vendor platforms. We assume the impact of reporting this barrier is a proxy for the\nextent to which vendors hinder a hospital’s interoperability. In the model, we control for the\nfollowing: hospital’s primary vendor, participation in health exchange organization, participation\nin five different networks, system ownership, level of system centralization, bed size, profit\nstatus, public status, region, location in urban area. The marginal effect of b is 0.04. We assume\nthat this effect may capture other reasons not related to information blocking, so we use half of\nthis estimate for our benefit calculations – 0.02.\n\nTable 28: Benefits of Prohibiting and/or Deterring Information Blocking\n(2017 Dollars)\nBenefit Type Total Cost\nImpacted\nTotal Cost Overall\nInterop\nImpact\n(Marginal\nEffect)\nPercent of\nproviders\nsusceptible\nto\ninformation\nblocking\nMarginal\nEffect of\ninformation\nblocking\n(percentage\npoints)\nTotal BenefitA\nDuplicate\ntesting\n100% 200 billionB\n0.09C\n82% 0.02 $295,200,000\nAvoidable\nhospitalizations\nand\nreadmissions\n100% $41 billionD\n0.09 82% 0.02 $60,516,000\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of this calculation, we estimate that the benefit of the information blocking provision\nis $456 million.\n\n*Comments.* We did not receive any comments regarding our approach to estimating\nbenefits or the specific benefit estimates associated with information blocking.\n\n*Response.* ONC has revised its methodological approach to quantifying the benefits of our\ninformation blocking provision. This new methodology is described in the RIA.\n\n(6) Total Annual Cost Estimate\nThe total annual cost estimate is expressed in 2016 dollars to meet regulatory reform analysis\nrequirements under Executive Order 13771. We estimated that the total cost for this final rule for\nthe first year after it is finalized (including one-time costs), based on the cost estimates outlined\nabove and throughout this RIA, would range, on average, from $953 million to $2.6 billion with\nER visits\n131million\nvisitsE\nCost per ER\nvisit\n$1,233\n0.03 82% 0.02 $79,469,316\nAdverse drug\nevents\n20% $30 billionF\n0.22 82% 0.02 $21,648,000\nTotal benefit per year $456,833,316\n456833316\nA\nTotal benefit would be a product of % of total cost impacted, total cost, overall interop impact, percent of\nproviders susceptible to information blocking, and marginal effect of information blocking; however, no\nreasonable estimate of the marginal effect of information blocking is currently available.\n\n**B**\n\nNational Academy of Medicine (2016), http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/20/news/economy/medical-\ntests/index.html.\n\n**C**\n\nStephen E.

We estimated that the total perpetual cost for this final\nrule (starting in year two), based on the cost estimates outlined above, would range, on average,\nfrom $366 million to $1.3 billion with an average annual cost of $840 million. We also included\nestimates based on the stakeholder groups affected. We estimated the total costs to health IT\ndevelopers to be between $483 million and $1.1 billion (including one-time and perpetual costs)\nwith $633,000 in cost savings from deregulatory actions. Assuming that 458 health IT\ndevelopers will be impacted, the cost per developer will range from $1.1 million to $2.4 million.\n\nBased on previous participation in the CMS EHR Incentive Program, we estimated that 439,187\nhealth care providers in 95,470 clinical practices and 4,519 hospitals that participated in the CMS\nEHR Incentive Program will be impacted by this final rule. We estimated the total cost to health\ncare providers to be between $478 million to $1.6 billion. We did not calculate per entity costs\nfor health care providers. We acknowledged that costs may be passed from health IT developers\nto their customers (i.e. health care providers) during the licensing of their health IT modules. We\nestimated the total costs to ONC-ACBs to be between $391,000 and $792,000. We estimated the\ngovernment costs (through labor hours of ONC staff) to be between $159,000 and $586,000 with\n$4,497 in cost savings from deregulatory actions. In addition to the above-mentioned cost\nsavings that are attributable to specific stakeholder groups, we estimated an additional cost\nsavings of $6.6 million to $13.3 million to all stakeholders affected by this provision. We are\nunable to attribute these amounts to specific stakeholder groups. We did not receive comment\nregarding these calculations. We have finalized our estimates.\n\n(7) Total Annual Benefit Estimate\nThe total annual benefit estimate is expressed in 2016 dollars to meet regulatory\nreform analysis requirements under Executive Order 13771. We estimated the total annual\nbenefit for this final rule, based on the benefit estimates outlined above, would range from $1.2\n\n\n\n\nbillion to $5.0 billion with primary estimated annual benefit of $3.1 billion. Our estimates\ninclude benefits attributed to the entire health care system, including hospitals, clinicians, payers\nand patients.(8) Total Annualized Net Benefit\nThe total annualized net benefit is expressed in 2016 dollars to meet regulatory reform\nanalysis requirements under Executive Order 13771. We estimate the total annualized net benefit\nfor this final rule, based on the estimates outlined above, would range from $191 million to $2.3\nbillion with a primary net benefit estimate of $1.3 billion.\nb. Accounting Statement and Table\nWhen a rule is considered an economically significant rule under Executive Order 12866,\nwe are required to develop an accounting statement indicating the classification of the\nexpenditures associated with the provisions of the proposed rule. Monetary annual benefits are\npresented as discounted flows using three percent and seven percent factors in Table 29. We are\nnot able to explicitly define the universe of all costs, but have provided an average of likely costs\nof this final rule as well as a high and low range of likely costs. Unquantifiable costs and benefits\nare noted in Table 31. This final rule requires no Federal transfers, but it might bring about a\nreduction in fraudulent payments to providers by the Federal Government and other payers.245\nTable 29: EO 12866 Summary Table (in $ millions, 2016 Dollars)\nPrimary\n(3%)\nLower\nBound\n(3%)\nUpper\nBound\n(3%)\nPrimary\n(7%)\nLower\nBound\n(7%)\nUpper\nBound\n(7%)\nPresent Value of Quantified Costs 6,454 2,966 9,943 4,574 2,120 7,028\nPresent Value of Quantified Benefits 23,411 8,831 37,991 16,552 6,244 26,859\n245\nParente, Stephen T., Karen Mandelbaum, Susan P.

              "text": "The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to analyze options for regulatory\nrelief of small businesses if a rule has a significant impact on a substantial number of small\nentities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) establishes the size of small businesses for\nFederal Government programs based on average annual receipts or the average employment of a\nfirm.246\nThe entities that are likely to be directly affected by the requirements in this final rule are\nhealth IT developers. We note that the reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute\ninformation blocking provide flexibilities and relief for health IT developers of certified health\nIT, health information networks, health information exchanges, and health care providers in\nrelation to the information blocking provision of the Cures Act. These reasonable and necessary\nactivities also take into account the potential burden on small entities to meet these “exceptions”\nto information blocking, such as with considering the size and resources of small entities when\nmeeting security requirements to qualify for the “promoting the security of electronic health\ninformation” exception.\n\nWhile health IT developers that pursue certification of their health IT under the Program\nrepresent a small segment of the overall information technology industry, we believe that many\nhealth IT developers impacted by the requirements in this final rule most likely fall under the\nNorth American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 “Custom Computer\n246\nThe SBA references that annual receipts means “total income” (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, “gross\nincome”) plus “cost of goods sold” as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service tax return\nforms.\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Services.”247\nThe SBA size standard associated with this NAICS code is set at\n$27.5 million annual receipts or less. There is enough data generally available to establish that\nbetween 75 percent and 90 percent of entities that are categorized under the NAICS code 541511\nare under the SBA size standard. We also note that with the exception of aggregate business\ninformation available through the U.S. Census Bureau and the SBA related to NAICS code\n541511, it appears that many health IT developers that pursue certification of their health IT\nunder the Program are privately held or owned and do not regularly, if at all, make their specific\nannual receipts publicly available. As a result, it is difficult to locate empirical data related to\nmany of these health IT developers to correlate to the SBA size standard. However, although not\nperfectly correlated to the size standard for NAICS code 541511, we do have information\nindicating that over 60 percent of health IT developers that have had Complete EHRs and/or\nHealth IT Modules certified to the 2011 Edition had less than 51 employees (80 FR 62741).\n\nWe estimated that the requirements in this final rule will have effects on health IT\ndevelopers, some of which may be small entities, that have certified health IT or are likely to\npursue certification of their health IT under the Program. We believe, however, that we have\nfinalized the minimum amount of requirements necessary to accomplish our primary policy goal\nof enhancing interoperability. Further, as discussed in section XIII.B of this RIA above, there are\nno appropriate regulatory or non-regulatory alternatives that could be developed to lessen the\ncompliance burden associated with this final rule because many of the provisions are derived\ndirectly from legislative mandates in the Cures Act. Additionally, we have attempted to offset\nsome of the burden imposed on health IT developers in this final rule with cost saving provisions\n247\nhttps://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/Size_Standards_Table_2017.pdf\n\n\n\n\nthrough deregulatory actions (see section III). Additionally, the Secretary certifies that this final\nrule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.\n\n\n",
